Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance\nsafety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,\nEBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an \"energy landscape\". We use the\ngradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to\nlow energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in\nreal-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral\ncontrol from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with\nminimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of\nmodels show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially\nlowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H\nbenchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety\nperformance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that\nachieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5EDS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6b63LLM\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62d2\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8c28\u614e\uff0c\u5bf9\u826f\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u8bef\u62d2\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62d2\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff08EBM\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6d41\u5411\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a Steering \u800c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728ORB-H\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c06\u5408\u89c4\u7387\u4ece57.3%\u63d0\u5347\u81f382.6%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EDS\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u8bef\u62d2\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective\nfor image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities\nsuch as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene\nunderstanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs\nremains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on\nspecialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison\nof fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and\nfine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay\ndetection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs\ncan be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to\nachieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based\nbaselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring\nhow language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with\nminimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging\nvision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal\nlearning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data\nefficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and\nprovide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in\nlow-resource visual environments.

In submission", "summary": "We propose a Geometry-aware Policy Imitation (GPI) approach that rethinks\nimitation learning by treating demonstrations as geometric curves rather than\ncollections of state-action samples. From these curves, GPI derives distance\nfields that give rise to two complementary control primitives: a progression\nflow that advances along expert trajectories and an attraction flow that\ncorrects deviations. Their combination defines a controllable, non-parametric\nvector field that directly guides robot behavior. This formulation decouples\nmetric learning from policy synthesis, enabling modular adaptation across\nlow-dimensional robot states and high-dimensional perceptual inputs. GPI\nnaturally supports multimodality by preserving distinct demonstrations as\nseparate models and allows efficient composition of new demonstrations through\nsimple additions to the distance field. We evaluate GPI in simulation and on\nreal robots across diverse tasks. Experiments show that GPI achieves higher\nsuccess rates than diffusion-based policies while running 20 times faster,\nrequiring less memory, and remaining robust to perturbations.

However, detecting HFOs\nremains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.\nVisual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and\nsubjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is\ncritical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel\nmethod for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500\nHz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy\npatients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize\nevents extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The\nproposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,\nand artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a\nsensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the\ncontrolled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger\ncorrelation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in\nresected versus non-resected contacts.

This work evaluates the\nperformance of the model by comparing it with the policy that will be guided.\nTo fully explore this, various tests are performed using both fully-actuated\nand under-actuated simulated robotic hands to manipulate different objects for\na given task. The performance of the model will also be tested for\ngeneralization tests, by changing the properties of the objects in which both\nthe policy and dynamic model were trained, such as density and size, and\nadditionally by guiding a trained policy in a certain object to perform the\nsame task in a different one. The results of this work show that, given a\npolicy with high average reward and an accurate dynamic model, the hybrid\nframework improves the performance of in-hand manipulation tasks for most test\ncases, even when the object properties are changed. However, this improvement\ncomes at the expense of increasing the computational cost, due to the\ncomplexity of trajectory evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u5185\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u867d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u589e\u52a0\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u5185\u64cd\u4f5c\u56e0\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0e\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u4eff\u771f\u624b\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u8de8\u7269\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u6cdb\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002"}}

Addressing\nlimitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on\nimplicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation\nphysics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts\n(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming\ndegradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,\nenabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple\nheterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light\nconditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and\nexploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and\nFrequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze\ndegradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.\nPhysics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation\nstrategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring\nimaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets\n(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves\nsuperior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods.

This paper\nintroduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the\nexplainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.\nFirst, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the\naccuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic\nAutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature\nattributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection\nexperiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP\nvalues and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral\npredictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By\ncomparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise\nbenchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in\nforecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset\nfound that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with\nimproved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate\nand the original forecasting model.

While multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and\nsystematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as\nexisting benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or\nspatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive\nand fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied\ncapabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across\n14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory\nunderstanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation\nresults of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across\nall domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose\nBEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision\nmodels to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning\ncapabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse\nembodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative\nimprovement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that\nimproving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated\nenvironments.

In this paper, we propose a novel visual teach-and-repeat navigation\nsystem, which consists of a flexible map representation, robust map matching\nand a map-less local navigation module. During the teaching process, the\nrecorded keyframes are formulated as a topo-metric graph and each node can be\nfurther extended to save new observations.

To enhance the place\nrecognition performance during repeating process, instead of using\nframe-to-frame matching, we firstly implement keyframe clustering to aggregate\nsimilar connected keyframes into local map and perform place recognition based\non visual frame-tolocal map matching strategy. To promote the local goal\npersistent tracking performance, a long-term goal management algorithm is\nconstructed, which can avoid the robot getting lost due to environmental\nchanges or obstacle occlusion.

Existing methods typically map 3D\ninstances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for\nclassification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from\n2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during\ninference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we\npropose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided\nKnowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that\nextracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary\nknowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled\n3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding\nnoise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference\nprocess. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP\nembedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint\ndiversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then\ndevelop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D\ninstance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to\ndistill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the\nstudent model.

The observer can\nobserve the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.\nThe agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We\nformalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence\nconstraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the\nanticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of\npublic suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability\ndecreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at\na $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin\nproblem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the\noptimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose\nan algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts\nits exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public\nsuboptimality gaps.

Schoellig"], "title": "Failure Prediction at Runtime for Generative Robot Policies", "comment": "Accepted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow\nmatching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,\ndistribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can\nstill cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early\nfailure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots\nin human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure\nprediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via\nconformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,\naggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER\nacross five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure\nmodes.

Evaluated on\neducational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,\ncuriosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.\nVisualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and\nadaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in\nreal-time learning systems", "AI": {"tldr": "Edu-EmotionNet\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEdu-EmotionNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4ea4\u53c9\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08CMAA\uff09\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08MIE\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u9988\u73af\uff08TFL\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u60c5\u611f\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cd\u6807\u6ce8\u7684IEMOCAP\u548cMOSEI\u6559\u80b2\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931/\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Edu-EmotionNet\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u60c5\u611f\u8f6c\u53d8\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

We train the model on 36 different\nmodular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under\nsimulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular\ngeometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the\naneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,\noutperforming several baselines.

Aerial\ndrone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces\nlimited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,\noccluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail\nto address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that\nreflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,\nenvironments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a\nproblem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these\nunique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data\naugmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in\nconstrained data settings.

To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel\nparadigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex\nperception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling\nperception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with\nreinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception\naccuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,\nand generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data\nare purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent\ngains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks.

Existing SOTA\nmethods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and\nshape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily\ndue to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which\nbridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to\nreformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D\nreconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently\nlearn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction\nperformance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block\nthat learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and\nuses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we\nintegrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion\nmodule. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively\nleverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global\nand local features to improve performance.

Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss\nclosely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised\nContrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this\nloss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\\em Do CL and NSCL also remain\naligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their\nobjectives?}\n  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL\nmodels trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and\naugmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain\nsimilar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL\nstay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability\nguarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and\nrepresentational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment\nimproves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch\nsize. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently\nunstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with\ntraining time.\n  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL\nalignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more\nclosely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled\nbridge between self-supervised and supervised learning.

However, we\nfind that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.\nWe therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches\nthat enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on\nconfidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art\nperformance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and\n52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall\nArithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby\ndemonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks.

Previous work\n(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the\ndecision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper\nand lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this\ngap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that\nscales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their\noptimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and\nit remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.\n  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives\nexploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than\noptimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the\nremoval of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without\nexplicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic\ntransitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret\nbounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition\nstructures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).\n  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free\nlearning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in\nFoster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret\nbounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$\n(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we\nredesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from\n$T^{2/3}$ to $\\sqrt{T}$.

ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory\nsemantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically\nregulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it\nenhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies\nthe hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit\nassignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,\nMATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "ACPO\u901a\u8fc7\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8bfe\u7a0b\u548c attribution-based \u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347RLVR\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u95f4\u5931\u8861\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u71b5\u8fc7\u65e9\u574d\u7f29\u3002", "method": "ACPO\u91c7\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6bb5\u4e0eattributions\u8868\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7cbe\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIME\u3001MATH\u548cAMC\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cACPO\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ACPO\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RLVR\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22-\u5229\u7528\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although algorithms such as\nUpper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret\ntheories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a\ntime-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the\ndynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel\nfrequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a\nsignal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each\narm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to\nthe component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an\nadaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove\nthe main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent\nin the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral\ncomponents, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit\ncount. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning\nthe exploration rate decay.

Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage\nefficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of\nstate-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a\ntrade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for\nhigh-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical\nwhen generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often\noccupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct\nthese regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical\ndecision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training\nframework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating\nlesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it\nnot only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of\nlesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in\nacute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical\nfor optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion\nMRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often\nconstrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817\npatients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and\nenhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT\nperfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.\nFurthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs\nand exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse\nmedical image translation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u75c5\u53d8\u611f\u77e5\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u75c5\u7076\u7ec6\u8282\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u75c5\u7076\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bca\u65ad\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u7b49\u9700\u7cbe\u51c6\u8bc6\u522b\u5fae\u5c0f\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u75c5\u53d8\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u533b\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u63d0\u5347\u75c5\u7076\u533a\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728817\u4f8b\u6025\u6027\u7f3a\u8840\u6027\u5352\u4e2d\u60a3\u8005\u7684CT\u5230DWI/ADC\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u75c5\u7076\u52fe\u753b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u901a\u7528\u9002\u914d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,\nsynthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal\nSemantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise\nimage-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the\ngenerative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and\nvertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication\nmetadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These\nheterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,\nenabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis\ndemonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low\nWasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under\nmatching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,\nexemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model\naccuracy on columnar cells.

However, acquiring sufficient\nlabeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.\nFederated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by\nsharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent\ninter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure\nprediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous\nclient settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized\nfederated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge\ndistillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.\nSpecifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated\nmodel and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched\nknowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an\nadaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs\nand intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,\na proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model\nupdates, thereby enhancing training stability.

We implement and\nsystematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based\nmodels, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern\nEfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our\nstudy is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature\nand practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies\nof 96\\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\\% (IJERCSE), and 93\\% (Sensors), our standardized\nre-implementations achieve 46.0\\%, 55.6\\%, and 57.7\\% respectively. Our modern\nSOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,\nachieves 92.25\\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are\npossible with modern architectures and systematic optimization.

As\ninteractions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the\ninterpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes\nincreasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful\nhuman-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations\nof the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge\nin deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of\ninterpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,\ni.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD\nsystems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable\nDriving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric\nvideo dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as\ncausal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived\nfrom both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we\npropose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates\nspatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc\ntechniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the\nDAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater\ninterpretability than conventional CNN-based models.

The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John\nOldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.\nExperiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six\nbehaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,\ndrinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust\ngeneralisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the\npotential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Cattle-CLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u725b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86CattleBehaviours6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u725b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0e\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u76d1\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u65f6\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u725b\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u53d1\u5e03\u7684CattleBehaviours6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0b\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe96.1%\uff0c\u5bf9\u8fdb\u98df\u3001\u996e\u6c34\u548c\u7acb\u59ff\u53cd\u520d\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1100%\uff0c\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Cattle-CLIP\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u52a8\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While existing long-video\nmethods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting\n(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to\nsingle-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive\nmotions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error\naccumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing\nclean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on\nself-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI\nincorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that\nrecycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into\nsupervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct\nits own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors\nthrough closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected\nfeedback.

However, its vulnerability to\nadversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.\nAlthough existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from\nthree key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial\nattacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)\nthey have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but\ninstead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can\nintroduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack\nof robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent\nGeneral-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel\nrobust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted\nadversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is\ndesigned to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to\nexecute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it\nexplicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum\nobjective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to\ndevelop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To\nensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift\ncaused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.\nExtensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least\n27.9\\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to\nadversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based\nautonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIGCARL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6218\u7565\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4ec5\u5e94\u5bf9\u77ed\u89c6\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u96be\u5f15\u53d1\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1IGCARL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6218\u7565\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u6297\u8005\uff08\u5229\u7528DRL\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6b65\u534f\u8c03\u653b\u51fb\u5e76\u805a\u7126\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u548c\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9a7e\u9a76\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u822c\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eIGCARL\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u81f3\u5c11\u63d0\u534727.9%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "IGCARL\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e09\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on\ntackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making\nit difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement\nmethods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited\neffectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of\nthis, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt\nFusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt\npairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we\nfuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing\nadaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific\ndegradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective\nProgressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the\nmodel's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not\nonly allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,\nbut also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image.

However, existing\nreasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often\ntreating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce\nBLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging\nperceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require\nmodels to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from\nlanguage-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception\nbenchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception (\"see\") and requires\nfine-grained observation and analytical reasoning (\"observe\"). BLINK-Twice\nintegrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing\nvisual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on\nvisual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of\nthe reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading\nMLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.\nBLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models.

Nonetheless, its effectiveness\ncritically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,\nachieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene\nstructure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is\noften violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian\nmodels with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and\nartifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in\nincorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded\nor invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply\nclone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of\nreconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose\nVAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban\nscenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based\nvisibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through\ndiversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch\nmatching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the\ngeneration of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even\nin regions lacking initial points.

Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go\nbeyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that\nMPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal\nprompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1MPO\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u529b", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5019\u9009\u63d0\u793a\u9009\u62e9", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cMPO\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u91ca\u653eMLLMs\u5168\u90e8\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4"}}

We further\nillustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and\nempirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and\nreal-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u53c2\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u540e\u7ed9\u4e88\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6fc0\u52b1\u65e9\u671f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5e76\u4fdd\u969c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6e05\u6d17\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u969c\u788d\u6216\u8ba4\u77e5\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e9\u671f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u627f\u62c5\u66f4\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5374\u672a\u83b7\u76f8\u5e94\u56de\u62a5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u65e9\u671f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5956\u52b1\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u5408\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u65e9\u671f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u610f\u613f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\u5e94\u7eb3\u5165\u534f\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5e94\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u7406\u6027\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

This paper\naims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by\ntackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and\nlabor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of\neffective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to\nindividual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that\nintegrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware\nmodeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden\nthe all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using\na task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video\nscenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising\napproximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While\nspecialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for\nevaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by\nmanually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive\ntraining with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the\npotential knowledge conflict.

In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution\ncapability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our\narchitecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token\nand a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action\nknowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform\nlightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the\nsmall action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder\nand avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the\nlanguage model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to\nintegrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation.

While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in\nextracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by\nreceiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise\ntransmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and\nreceiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel\nnoise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the\nRFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is\nparticularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,\nas replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance\ndegradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to\ncross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer\nto explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features.

Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well\nmodels learn these attributes.

In this\nwork, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a\nconstant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.\nSpecifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a\nDeep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents\nrepresentational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit\nboth the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of\none-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment\nbetween negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or\nnon-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with\nVAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as\na drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.\nEmpirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and\nsubstantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model\nbackbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection.

Accepted at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential\nprivacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to\ngenerate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in\n$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the\nfundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy\nguarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global\nminimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local\nperspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around\na fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on\nboth $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax\nrisk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,\nwe (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP\nframework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler\nyields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.\nBuilding on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the\nlocally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of\n$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models\nprivate sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is\nrepresented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally\noptimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it\nconsistently outperforms global minimax samplers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4ecd\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e0ef-\u6563\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4f18\u5316\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u91c7\u6837\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7eafLDP\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u6cdb\u51fdLDP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u56f4\u7ed5\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03P0\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u6cdb\u51fdLDP\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5728\u6b64\u5c40\u90e8\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e0ef-\u6563\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79c1\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u6846\u67b6\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u79c1\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u6709\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To protect in danger patients from additional kidney\ndamage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are\ncrucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning\nmodels can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an\nenormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector\nnowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction\ncapability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive\ncomputer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is\nattained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing\nvalues; those are filled in using \"mean-mode\" and \"Random sampling method\"\nstrategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques\n(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision\nTree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance\nevaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the\ntechniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy.
