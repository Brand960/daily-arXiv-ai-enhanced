Eye gaze offers a fast, non-intrusive, and intent-rich input modality, making it an attractive channel for conveying user goals. In this work, we present GAMMA (Gaze Assisted Manipulation for Modular Autonomy), a system that leverages ego-centric gaze tracking and a vision-language model to infer user intent and autonomously execute robotic manipulation tasks. By contextualizing gaze fixations within the scene, the system maps visual attention to high-level semantic understanding, enabling skill selection and parameterization without task-specific training. We evaluate GAMMA on a range of table-top manipulation tasks and compare it against baseline gaze-based control without reasoning. Results demonstrate that GAMMA provides robust, intuitive, and generalizable control, highlighting the potential of combining foundation models and gaze for natural and scalable robot autonomy.

We introduce PRISM (Protocol Refinement through Intelligent Simulation Modeling), a framework that automates the design, validation, and execution of experimental protocols on a laboratory platform composed of off-the-shelf robotic instruments. PRISM uses a set of language-model-based agents that work together to generate and refine experimental steps. The process begins with automatically gathering relevant procedures from web-based sources describing experimental workflows. These are converted into structured experimental steps (e.g., liquid handling steps, deck layout and other related operations) through a planning, critique, and validation loop. The finalized steps are translated into the Argonne MADSci protocol format, which provides a unified interface for coordinating multiple robotic instruments (Opentrons OT-2 liquid handler, PF400 arm, Azenta plate sealer and peeler) without requiring human intervention between steps. To evaluate protocol-generation performance, we benchmarked both single reasoning models and multi-agent workflow across constrained and open-ended prompting paradigms. The resulting protocols were validated in a digital-twin environment built in NVIDIA Omniverse to detect physical or sequencing errors before execution. Using Luna qPCR amplification and Cell Painting as case studies, we demonstrate PRISM as a practical end-to-end workflow that bridges language-based protocol generation, simulation-based validation, and automated robotic execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "PRISM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u534f\u8bae\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "PRISM\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ece\u7f51\u7edc\u83b7\u53d6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5212-\u6279\u8bc4-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5faa\u73af\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aArgonne MADSci\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408NVIDIA Omniverse\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Luna qPCR\u548cCell Painting\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cPRISM\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u534f\u8bae\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PRISM\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6253\u901a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u5230\u7269\u7406\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u94fe\u6761\u3002"}}

In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we study Task-Oriented Shape Completion, a new task that focuses on completing the potential contact regions rather than the entire shape. We argue that shape completion for grasping should be explicitly guided by the downstream manipulation task. To achieve this, we first generate multiple task-oriented shape completion candidates by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of object functional understanding from several pre-trained foundation models. A 3D discriminative autoencoder is then proposed to evaluate the plausibility of each generated candidate and optimize the most plausible one from a global perspective. A conditional flow-matching model named FlowGrasp is developed to generate task-oriented dexterous grasps from the optimized shape. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in task-oriented dexterous grasping and task-oriented shape completion, improving the Grasp Displacement and the Chamfer Distance over the state-of-the-art by 16.17\\% and 55.26%, respectively.

Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling.

This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance.

We model latent tasks as probabilistic formal languages and introduce a tailored reactive synthesis framework that balances robot costs with user task preferences. Our methodology focuses on safety-constrained learning and inferring formal task specifications as Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automata (PDFA). We adapt existing evidence-driven state merging algorithms and incorporate safety requirements throughout the learning process to ensure that the learned PDFA always complies with safety constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-objective reactive synthesis algorithm that generates deterministic strategies that are guaranteed to satisfy the PDFA task while optimizing the trade-offs between user preferences and robot costs, resulting in a Pareto front of optimal solutions. Our approach models the interaction as a two-player game between the robot and the environment, accounting for dynamic changes. We present a computationally-tractable value iteration algorithm to generate the Pareto front and the corresponding deterministic strategies. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms across various robots and tasks, showing that the learned PDFA never includes unsafe behaviors and that synthesized strategies consistently achieve the task while meeting both the robot cost and user-preference requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u53cd\u5e94\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u793a\u6559\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u5bfc\u5b89\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u8303\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u5c06\u6f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u6709\u9650\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff08PDFA\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u5408\u5e76\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u53cd\u5e94\u7efc\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u73a9\u5bb6\u535a\u5f08\u5efa\u6a21\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u5b66PDFA\u59cb\u7ec8\u65e0\u5371\u9669\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u53cc\u91cd\u8981\u6c42", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u793a\u6559\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image.

See https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIME and https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIMEBench for associated code", "summary": "Reasoning oriented large language models often expose explicit \"thinking\" as long, turn-global traces at the start of every response, either always on or toggled externally at inference time. While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact.

Its diagnosis by biopsy requires a high level of expertise and precision from the surgeon, so the results are highly operator-dependent. The aim of this work is to develop a robotic system for assisted ultrasound (US) examination of the prostate, a prebiopsy step that could reduce the dexterity requirements and enable faster, more accurate and more available prostate biopsy. We developed and validated a laboratory setup with a collaborative robotic arm that can autonomously scan a prostate phantom and attached the phantom to a medical robotic arm that mimics the patient's movements. The scanning robot keeps the relative position of the US probe and the prostate constant, ensuring a consistent and robust approach to reconstructing the prostate. To reconstruct the prostate, each slice is segmented to generate a series of prostate contours converted into a 3D point cloud used for biopsy planning. The average scan time of the prostate was 30 s, and the average 3D reconstruction of the prostate took 3 s. We performed four motion scenarios: the phantom was scanned in a stationary state (S), with horizontal motion (H), with vertical motion (V), and with a combination of the two (C). System validation is performed by registering the prostate point cloud reconstructions acquired during different motions (H, V, C) with those obtained in the stationary state. ICP registration with a threshold of 0.8 mm yields mean 83.2\\% fitness and 0.35 mm RMSE for S-H registration, 84.1\\% fitness and 0.37 mm RMSE for S-V registration and 79.4\\% fitness and 0.37 mm RMSE for S-C registration.

Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding.

While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds.

However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts.

This paper addresses the challenge of mapping the complexity of human language to the structured action space of modular ADS software. We propose a framework that integrates an LLM-based interaction layer with Autoware, a widely used open-source software. This system enables passengers to issue high-level commands, from querying status information to modifying driving behavior. Our methodology is grounded in three key components: a taxonomization of interaction categories, an application-centric Domain Specific Language (DSL) for command translation, and a safety-preserving validation layer.

While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency.

Selecting an appropriate kernel is therefore central to model quality, yet remains one of the most challenging and computationally expensive steps in probabilistic modeling. We present a Bayesian optimization framework built on kernel-of-kernels geometry, using expected divergence-based distances between GP priors to explore kernel space efficiently. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search.

Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.\n  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness.

However, non-injective functions can be restricted to sub-domains on which they are locally injective and surjective and thus invertible if the dimensionality between input and output spaces are the same.

Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions.

Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to the pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP models. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations reveal clearer semantic clustering of normal and abnormal cases, demonstrating the model's enhanced diagnostic sensitivity.

A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \\emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.\n  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.\n  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations.

Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasibile models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset.

Despite performance improvements from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), current models lack a mechanism to trace how small targets trigger directional, layer-wise perturbations in the feature space, which is an essential cue for distinguishing signal from structured noise in infrared scenes. To address this limitation, we propose the Trajectory-Aware Mamba Propagation Network (TAPM-Net), which explicitly models the spatial diffusion behavior of target-induced feature disturbances. TAPM-Net is built upon two novel components: a Perturbation-guided Path Module (PGM) and a Trajectory-Aware State Block (TASB). The PGM constructs perturbation energy fields from multi-level features and extracts gradient-following feature trajectories that reflect the directionality of local responses. The resulting feature trajectories are fed into the TASB, a Mamba-based state-space unit that models dynamic propagation along each trajectory while incorporating velocity-constrained diffusion and semantically aligned feature fusion from word-level and sentence-level embeddings. Unlike existing attention-based methods, TAPM-Net enables anisotropic, context-sensitive state transitions along spatial trajectories while maintaining global coherence at low computational cost.

Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation.

Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections.

However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density.

Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults.

The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data. Posterior results for synthetic true models demonstrate that the DSI-VAE framework gives accurate predictions for pressure, strain, and stress fields and for fault slip tendency. The framework is also shown to reduce uncertainty in key geomechanical and fault parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528VAE\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u751f\u6210\u540e\u9a8c\u5730\u8d28\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4bCO\u2082\u5c01\u5b58\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u538b\u529b\u3001\u5e94\u529b\u3001\u5e94\u53d8\u53ca\u65ad\u5c42\u6ed1\u52a8\u503e\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8026\u5408\u6d41-\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u542b\u65ad\u5c42\u7684\u5730\u4e0b\u4f5c\u4e1a\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5806\u53e0\u5377\u79efLSTM\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u62df\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u53cd\u6f14\uff08DSI\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u62103D\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cDSI-VAE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u538b\u529b\u3001\u5e94\u53d8\u3001\u5e94\u529b\u573a\u53ca\u65ad\u5c42\u6ed1\u52a8\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5173\u952e\u5730\u8d28\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u65ad\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u6f14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u540e\u9a8c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure.

This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders.

This study presents a multi-task deep learning framework that jointly performs lesion segmentation and diagnostic classification using embeddings from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) vision encoder.

The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts. Experiments on the PRECISE 2025 breast ultrasound dataset, split per class into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing, show that the proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.887 and an accuracy of 92.3 percent, ranking among the top entries on the PRECISE challenge leaderboard.

In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far.

To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions.

Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information.

Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive.

The resulting swapped faces exist merely as a set of unstructured pixels without any capacity for animation or interactive manipulation. Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning.

To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise.

Within this realm, Transformers have emerged as the predominant architecture due to their strong ability to capture pairwise dependencies. However, Transformer-based models suffer from quadratic computational complexity and high memory overhead, limiting their scalability and practical deployment in long-term and large-scale MTS modeling. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising linear-time alternative with high expressiveness. Nevertheless, directly applying vanilla Mamba to MTS remains suboptimal due to three key limitations: (i) the lack of explicit cross-variate modeling, (ii) difficulty in disentangling the entangled intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions, and (iii) insufficient modeling of latent time-lag interaction effects. These issues constrain its effectiveness across diverse MTS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DeMa, a dual-path delay-aware Mamba backbone. DeMa preserves Mamba's linear-complexity advantage while substantially improving its suitability for MTS settings. Specifically, DeMa introduces three key innovations: (i) it decomposes the MTS into intra-series temporal dynamics and inter-series interactions; (ii) it develops a temporal path with a Mamba-SSD module to capture long-range dynamics within each individual series, enabling series-independent, parallel computation; and (iii) it designs a variate path with a Mamba-DALA module that integrates delay-aware linear attention to model cross-variate dependencies. Extensive experiments on five representative tasks, long- and short-term forecasting, data imputation, anomaly detection, and series classification, demonstrate that DeMa achieves state-of-the-art performance while delivering remarkable computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDeMa\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5Mamba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u56e0\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u539f\u751fMamba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\u89e3\u8026\u53ca\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6548\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "DeMa\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u8def\u5f84\u7528Mamba-SSD\u6355\u6349\u4e32\u5185\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u8def\u5f84\u7528Mamba-DALA\u7ed3\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u8de8\u53d8\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u957f\u671f/\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u63d2\u8865\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "DeMa\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Mamba\u5728MTS\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC.

We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains.

We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator.

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results.

This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection.

Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens.

The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $\u03b5> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/\u03b5^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $\u03b5$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/\u03b5)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples.

However, existing RLVR algorithms focus on different granularities, and each has complementary strengths and limitations. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) updates the policy with token-level importance ratios, which preserves fine-grained credit assignment but often suffers from high variance and instability. In contrast, Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) applies single sequence-level importance ratios across all tokens in a response that better matches sequence-level rewards, but sacrifices token-wise credit assignment. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Policy Optimization (DHPO) to bridge GRPO and GSPO within a single clipped surrogate objective. DHPO combines token-level and sequence-level importance ratios using weighting mechanisms. We explore two variants of the mixing mechanism, including an averaged mixing and an entropy-guided mixing.

Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 27 generative models, including GANs, deepfakes, and diffusion models, chronologically structured up to August 2024 to simulate real-world scenarios.

While this bias is beneficial for texture-rich natural images, it often degrades performance on shape-dominant data such as illustrations and sketches. Although prior work has proposed shape-biased models to mitigate this issue, these approaches lack a quantitative metric for identifying which datasets would actually benefit from such modifications. To address this gap, we propose a data-driven metric that quantifies the shape-texture balance of a dataset by computing the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) between each image's luminance channel and its L0-smoothed counterpart. Building on this metric, we further introduce a computationally efficient adaptation method that promotes shape bias by modifying the dilation of max-pooling operations while keeping convolutional weights frozen. Experimental results show that this approach consistently improves classification accuracy on shape-dominant datasets, particularly in low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is impractical, requiring training only the final classification layer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSSIM\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f62\u72b6-\u7eb9\u7406\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u5377\u79ef\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u8c03\u6574\u6700\u5927\u6c60\u5316\u81a8\u80c0\u7387\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u8349\u56fe\u7b49\u5f62\u72b6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "CNN\u5929\u7136\u504f\u5411\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u8349\u56fe\u7b49\u5f62\u72b6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4f55\u65f6\u9002\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u5224\u65ad\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u4eae\u5ea6\u901a\u9053\u4e0eL0\u5e73\u6ed1\u7248\u672c\u7684SSIM\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f62\u72b6-\u7eb9\u7406\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u5377\u79ef\u6743\u91cd\u3001\u4ec5\u8c03\u6574\u6700\u5927\u6c60\u5316\u81a8\u80c0\u7387\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u5f15\u5165\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u5373\u53ef\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u597d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faETCL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5411\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6b63\u5411\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u60f3\u4ee3\u7406\u5e94\u540c\u65f6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e24\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faETCL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u63a9\u7801\u9694\u79bb\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b63\u5411\u4e0e\u53cd\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u7ebf\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "ETCL\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u3001\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u6b63\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "ETCL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning.

Most gait models strive to implicitly learn the common traits across different gait conditions in a data-driven manner to pull different gait conditions closer for recognition. However, relatively few studies have explicitly explored the inherent relations between different gait conditions. For this purpose, we attempt to establish connections among different gait conditions and propose a new perspective to achieve gait recognition: variations in different gait conditions can be approximately viewed as a combination of geometric transformations. In this case, all we need is to determine the types of geometric transformations and achieve geometric invariance, then identity invariance naturally follows. As an initial attempt, we explore three common geometric transformations (i.e., Reflect, Rotate, and Scale) and design a $\\mathcal{R}$eflect-$\\mathcal{R}$otate-$\\mathcal{S}$cale invariance learning framework, named ${\\mathcal{RRS}}$-Gait. Specifically, it first flexibly adjusts the convolution kernel based on the specific geometric transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance.

These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7565\u5fae\u964d\u4f4e\u697c\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u4fe1\u53f7\u6ce2\u52a8\u53ca\u591a\u5c42\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u5c04\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6307\u7eb9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5efa\u7b51\u6216\u697c\u5c42\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65f6\u4ec5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u805a\u7c7b\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f46\u697c\u5c42\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u6240\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5ba4\u5185\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance.

To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance.

However, VLMs are inherently trained as generalist models, lacking specialized understanding of driving-specific reasoning in 3D space and time.

To address these limitations, we propose SGDrive, a novel framework that explicitly structures the VLM's representation learning around driving-specific knowledge hierarchies. Built upon a pre-trained VLM backbone, SGDrive decomposes driving understanding into a scene-agent-goal hierarchy that mirrors human driving cognition: drivers first perceive the overall environment (scene context), then attend to safety-critical agents and their behaviors, and finally formulate short-term goals before executing actions. This hierarchical decomposition provides the structured spatial-temporal representation that generalist VLMs lack, integrating multi-level information into a compact yet comprehensive format for trajectory planning.

Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "SketchVL\u901a\u8fc7FinePO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u56e0\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5bf9\u9519\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "SketchVL\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ed8\u56fe\u6807\u6ce8\u5e76\u53cd\u9988\u81ea\u8eab\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408FinePRM\u5bf9\u6bcf\u6b65\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FinePO\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53477.23%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, unconstrained residual matrices can compromise training stability. To address this, DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) approximately projects these matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope via iterative Sinkhorn--Knopp (SK) normalization. We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose mHC-lite, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices. This approach guarantees exact doubly stochasticity by construction and can be implemented using only native matrix operations.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and 3D generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "RCM\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4eba\u7269\u59ff\u6001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D\u89d2\u8272\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u65b0\u9896\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u89d2\u8272\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "RCM\u63d0\u51fa\u59ff\u6001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5230\u89c4\u8303\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u652f\u63011024x1024\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f68\u9053\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\uff08\u6700\u591a4\u56fe\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u53ef\u8c03\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u9896\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c3D\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u521d\u59cb\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4e0e\u591a\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "RCM\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u56fe3D\u89d2\u8272\u751f\u6210\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study reframes P-wave arrival detection as a self-supervised anomaly detection task to evaluate how architectural variations regulate the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and anomaly discrimination. Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce \"overgeneralization\", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications.

To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning.

Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts.

However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation.

We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training.

Current approaches primarily exploit only final-layer representations, while training-free methods require multiple forward passes or backpropagation. We propose ViTNT-FIQA, a training-free approach that measures the stability of patch embedding evolution across intermediate Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications. Through extensive evaluation on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C), we show that ViTNT-FIQA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ViTNT-FIQA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Vision Transformer\u4e2d\u95f4\u5757\u7684patch\u5d4c\u5165\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u8138\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709FIQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u7ec8\u5c42\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u591a\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u6216\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u4e0d\u901a\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fde\u7eedViT\u5757\u4e2dL2\u5f52\u4e00\u5316patch\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u6b27\u6c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u5206\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "conclusion": "ViTNT-FIQA\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3ViT\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6FIQA\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u957f\u5e8f\u5217Transformer\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u975e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8eab\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u76f8\u540cTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5212\u5206\u548c\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u4e0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u52a0\u6cd5\u3001\u62fc\u63a5+\u6295\u5f71\u3001\u6807\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u77ed\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u957f\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u914d\u5bf9\u79cd\u5b50\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u5f31\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\uff08\u5982ArXiv\uff09\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\u5177\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u95e8\u63a7\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u662f\u957f\u5e8f\u5217Transformer\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u9ed8\u8ba4\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u9700\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u7d20\u52a0\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u3002"}}

A separable operator-valued kernel extends the formulation to vector-valued data while retaining the simplicity of a single scalar similarity function. A subsequent kernel-alignment task projects the data into a lower-dimensional latent space whose Gram matrix aims to match the high-dimensional reconstruction kernel, thus transferring the auto-reconstruction geometry of the RKHS to the embedding. Therefore, the proposed algorithms represent an extended approach to the autorepresentation property, exhibited by many natural data, by using and adapting well-known results of Kernel Learning Theory.

To tackle the complex yet highly practical problem while overcoming the existing limitations of feature recovery, representation disentanglement, and label semantics modeling, we propose an Adaptive Disentangled Representation Learning method (ADRL). ADRL achieves robust view completion by propagating feature-level affinity across modalities with neighborhood awareness, and reinforces reconstruction effectiveness by leveraging a stochastic masking strategy. Through disseminating category-level association across label distributions, ADRL refines distribution parameters for capturing interdependent label prototypes. Besides, we formulate a mutual-information-based objective to promote consistency among shared representations and suppress information overlap between view-specific representation and other modalities. Theoretically, we derive the tractable bounds to train the dual-channel network.

Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDSTS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u77ed\u65f6\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u8c31\u7cfb\u969c\u788d\uff08ASD\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u79bb\u6563\u6027\u548c\u77ed\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfTransformer\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9002\u914d\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1DSTS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u6355\u6349\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDSTS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9ASD\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u77ed\u65f6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u6bd4\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0cDSTS\u4e3aASD\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper presents a Dual Pipeline Machine Learning Framework for multi class sleep disorder screening using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset. The framework consists of two parallel processing streams: a statistical pipeline that targets linear separability using Mutual Information and Linear Discriminant Analysis, and a wrapper based pipeline that applies Boruta feature selection with an autoencoder for non linear representation learning. To address class imbalance, we use the hybrid SMOTETomek resampling strategy. In experiments, Extra Trees and K Nearest Neighbors achieved an accuracy of 98.67%, outperforming recent baselines on the same dataset. Statistical testing using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test indicates that the improvement over baseline configurations is significant, and inference latency remains below 400 milliseconds.

In pursuit of a generation-friendly VAE, recent studies have explored leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as representation alignment targets for VAEs, mirroring the approach commonly adopted for LDMs. Although this yields certain performance gains, using the same alignment target for both VAEs and LDMs overlooks their fundamentally different representational requirements. We advocate that while LDMs benefit from latents retaining high-level semantic concepts, VAEs should excel in semantic disentanglement, enabling encoding of attribute-level information in a structured way. To address this, we propose the Semantic disentangled VAE (Send-VAE), explicitly optimized for disentangled representation learning through aligning its latent space with the semantic hierarchy of pre-trained VFMs. Our approach employs a non-linear mapper network to transform VAE latents, aligning them with VFMs to bridge the gap between attribute-level disentanglement and high-level semantics, facilitating effective guidance for VAE learning. We evaluate semantic disentanglement via linear probing on attribute prediction tasks, showing strong correlation with improved generation performance. Finally, using Send-VAE, we train flow-based transformers SiTs; experiments show Send-VAE significantly speeds up training and achieves a state-of-the-art FID of 1.21 and 1.75 with and without classifier-free guidance on ImageNet 256x256.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSend-VAE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06VAE\u4e0eLDM\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e8c\u8005\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\uff1aLDM\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u800cVAE\u5e94\u64c5\u957f\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSend-VAE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06VAE\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VFM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7\u89e3\u8026\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f3a\u89e3\u8026\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408SiT\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728ImageNet 256x256\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA FID\uff081.21\u65e0CFG\uff0c1.75\u6709CFG\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "VAE\u5e94\u72ec\u7acb\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u89e3\u8026\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u4effLDM\u76ee\u6807\uff0cSend-VAE\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the \"parts\" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively.

While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration.

A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region.

However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching.

However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.\n  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates.

Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels.

This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice.

This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines.

However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction.

Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughput constraint violation. These algorithms seek to minimize the virtual queue length in their algorithm design. However, in networks where channel conditions change abruptly, the resulting constraints may become infeasible, leading to unbounded growth in virtual queue lengths. In this paper, we make the key observation that the dynamics of the head-of-line age, i.e. the age of the oldest packet in the virtual queue, make it more robust when used in algorithm design compared to the virtual queue length. We therefore design a learning-based scheduling policy that uses the head-of-line age in place of the virtual queue length. We show that our policy matches state-of-the-art performance under i.i.d. network conditions. Crucially, we also show that the system remains stable even under abrupt changes in channel conditions and can rapidly recover from periods of constraint infeasibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u961f\u5217\u5934\u5e74\u9f84\u66ff\u4ee3\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u7ebf\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u7a81\u53d8\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u7a81\u53d8\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u961f\u5217\u65e0\u9650\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u961f\u5217\u5934\u5e74\u9f84\uff08head-of-line age\uff09\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4fe1\u9053\u7a81\u53d8\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e76\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u6062\u590d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u961f\u5217\u5934\u5e74\u9f84\u6bd4\u865a\u62df\u961f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The design plugs directly into standard transformer backbones (eg ViT and Swin) and adds fewer than 2 % parameters.

This work presents an anomaly detection framework based on the CoI paradigm by grouping sensors into communities using a fused similarity matrix that incorporates temporal correlations via Spearman coefficients, spatial proximity using Gaussian distance decay, and elevation similarities. For each community, representative stations based on the best silhouette are selected and three autoencoder architectures (BiLSTM, LSTM, and MLP) are trained using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with expanding window cross-validation and tested on stations from the same cluster and the best representative stations of other clusters. The models are trained on normal temperature patterns of the data and anomalies are detected through reconstruction error analysis.

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a key diagnostic modality, but its effectiveness is constrained by operator subjectivity. This study evaluates a Vision Transformer-based deep learning segmentation model for pancreatic tumors. Methods: A segmentation model using the USFM framework with a Vision Transformer backbone was trained and validated with 17,367 EUS images (from two public datasets) in 5-fold cross-validation. The model was tested on an independent dataset of 350 EUS images from another public dataset, manually segmented by radiologists. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, cropping, and resizing to 512x512 pixels. Metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), intersection over union (IoU), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: In 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean DSC of 0.651 +/- 0.738, IoU of 0.579 +/- 0.658, sensitivity of 69.8%, specificity of 98.8%, and accuracy of 97.5%. For the external validation set, the model achieved a DSC of 0.657 (95% CI: 0.634-0.769), IoU of 0.614 (95% CI: 0.590-0.689), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 97.7%.

We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment.

Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates.

While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.

In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger.

Conventional registration methods typically rely on iterative optimization of the deformation field, which is time-consuming. Although recent learning-based approaches enable fast and accurate registration during inference, their generalizability remains limited to the specific contrasts observed during training. In this work, we propose an adaptive conditional contrast-agnostic deformable image registration framework (AC-CAR) based on a random convolution-based contrast augmentation scheme. AC-CAR can generalize to arbitrary imaging contrasts without observing them during training. To encourage contrast-invariant feature learning, we propose an adaptive conditional feature modulator (ACFM) that adaptively modulates the features and the contrast-invariant latent regularization to enforce the consistency of the learned feature across different imaging contrasts. Additionally, we enable our framework to provide contrast-agnostic registration uncertainty by integrating a variance network that leverages the contrast-agnostic registration encoder to improve the trustworthiness and reliability of AC-CAR. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-CAR outperforms baseline methods in registration accuracy and exhibits superior generalization to unseen imaging contrasts.

While adversarial training is a widely adopted defense, its effectiveness under realistic conditions -- where attackers operate with limited knowledge and mismatched data distributions - remains underexplored. In this work, we extend the DUMB -- Dataset soUrces, Model architecture and Balance - and DUMBer methodology to deepfake detection. We evaluate detectors robustness against adversarial attacks under transferability constraints and cross-dataset configuration to extract real-world insights. Our study spans five state-of-the-art detectors (RECCE, SRM, XCeption, UCF, SPSL), three attacks (PGD, FGSM, FPBA), and two datasets (FaceForensics++ and Celeb-DF-V2). We analyze both attacker and defender perspectives mapping results to mismatch scenarios. Experiments show that adversarial training strategies reinforce robustness in the in-distribution cases but can also degrade it under cross-dataset configuration depending on the strategy adopted. These findings highlight the need for case-aware defense strategies in real-world applications exposed to adversarial attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u77e5\u8bc6\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55DUMB\u548cDUMBer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u8005\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u4e0e\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6240\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u91c7\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
