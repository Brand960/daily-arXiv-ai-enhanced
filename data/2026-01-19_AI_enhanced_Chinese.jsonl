Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters. We provide comprehensive evaluation on 1D and 2D benchmarks, and demonstrate applicability to higher-dimensional physics problems through experiments on $\u03c6^4$ lattice field theory, where our bijections outperform affine baselines and enable problem-specific designs that address mode collapse.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u6ed1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u6790\u53cd\u6f14\u7684\u53cc\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u4e09\u6b21\u6709\u7406\u3001sinh\u3001\u4e09\u6b21\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f84\u5411\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u53cc\u5c04\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u3001\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u5f31\u3001\u6837\u6761\u5206\u6bb5\u5149\u6ed1\u4e14\u9650\u4e8e\u6709\u754c\u57df\u3001\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u9700\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u9006\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u6ed1\u53cc\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5f84\u5411\u6d41\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f84\u5411\u5750\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u57281D/2D\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u6837\u6761\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u03c6\u2074\u683c\u70b9\u573a\u8bba\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eff\u5c04\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c111000\u500d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u3001\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9006\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u3002"}}

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUOWQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u8f6c\u79fb\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u6216\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e8c\u8005\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u5747\u5300\u8fc1\u79fb\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eKL\u6563\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acbUOWQ\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5355\u6e90\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u4e0e\u591a\u6e90\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5145\u5206\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u6e90\u6837\u672c\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728DomainNet\u548cOffice-Home\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "UOWQ\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

This coupling leads to the \"memory wall,\" where computational capacity is squandered on simulating retrieval, often resulting in hallucinations. In this paper, we propose \"digital metabolism,\" a thermodynamic hypothesis suggesting that targeted forgetting is necessary for distilling a pure neural logic core. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce the Regenerative Logic-Core Protocol (RLCP), a dual-stream training framework that renders specific factual dependencies linearly undecodable via deep-layer gradient reversal. Applying RLCP to Qwen2.5-0.5B, we observe a distinct phase transition: the model achieves near-zero retention of targeted factual associations (Accuracy < 7%) while exhibiting changes consistent with an emergent \"structural crystallization\" effect. Empirical analysis on GSM8K reveals that the \"metabolized\" model spontaneously adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) scaffolding, which we interpret as compensating for the loss of direct associative recall (shifting from $O(1)$ recall to $O(N)$ reasoning).

We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively.

In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\\times$ and $668\\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\\times$ and $3.11\\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMugi\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u503c\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\uff08VLP\uff09\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u5b9e\u73b045\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c668\u500d\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6GEMM\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9LLM\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684VLP\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55VLP\u652f\u6301\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u903c\u8fd1\uff08\u503c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u914d\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0GEMM\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u3001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u7ec4\u67e5\u8be2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784Mugi\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u8ff0\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "result": "Mugi\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027softmax\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad845\u00d7\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c668\u00d7\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728LLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b02.07\u00d7\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c3.11\u00d7\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u64cd\u4f5c\u78b3\u6392\u653e1.45\u00d7\u548c\u9690\u542b\u78b3\u6392\u653e1.48\u00d7\u3002", "conclusion": "Mugi\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684VLP\u9769\u65b0\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5168LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data.

In this work, we present a hierarchical control framework that integrates predictive power modeling with residual reinforcement learning to optimize omnidirectional locomotion efficiency for wheeled quadrupedal robots. Our approach employs a novel power prediction network that forecasts energy consumption across different gait patterns over a 1-second horizon, enabling intelligent selection of the most energy-efficient nominal gait. A reinforcement learning policy then generates residual adjustments to this nominal gait, fine-tuning the robot's actions to balance energy efficiency with performance objectives. Comparative analysis shows our method reduces energy consumption by up to 35\\% compared to fixed-gait approaches while maintaining comparable velocity tracking performance. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a modified Unitree Go1 platform, demonstrating robust performance even under external disturbances.

An Exploratory Study", "comment": null, "summary": "As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86GPT-4o\u3001Florence 2\u548cLLaVa-1.5\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5de5\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0cGPT-4o\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u8fd1\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u9886\u57df\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u76d1\u6d4b\u5de5\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u60c5\u7eea\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281000\u5f20\u6807\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d610\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u548c10\u79cd\u60c5\u7eea\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6bd4\u8f83GPT-4o\u3001Florence 2\u548cLLaVa-1.5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "GPT-4o\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0aF1=0.756\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u73870.799\uff0c\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522bF1=0.712\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u73870.773\uff1bFlorence 2\u6b21\u4e4b\uff0cLLaVa-1.5\u6700\u5dee\uff1b\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u8fd1\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5982\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c vs. \u4e0e\u4e3b\u7ba1\u6c9f\u901a\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u7528VLMs\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7b51\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Related to an earlier IEEE ICAR 2021 publication", "summary": "Multi-robot formation control has various applications in domains such as vehicle troops, platoons, payload transportation, and surveillance. Maintaining formation in a vehicle platoon requires designing a suitable control scheme that can tackle external disturbances and uncertain system parameters while maintaining a predefined safe distance between the robots. A crucial challenge in this context is dealing with the unknown/uncertain friction forces between wheels and the ground, which vary with changes in road surface, wear in tires, and speed of the vehicle. Although state-of-the-art adaptive controllers can handle a priori bounded uncertainties, they struggle with accurately modeling and identifying frictional forces, which are often state-dependent and cannot be a priori bounded.\n  This thesis proposes a new adaptive sliding mode controller for wheeled mobile robot-based vehicle platoons that can handle the unknown and complex behavior of frictional forces without prior knowledge of their parameters and structures. The controller uses the adaptive sliding mode control techniques to regulate the platoon's speed and maintain a predefined inter-robot distance, even in the presence of external disturbances and uncertain system parameters. This approach involves a two-stage process: first, the kinematic controller calculates the desired velocities based on the desired trajectory; and second, the dynamics model generates the commands to achieve the desired motion. By separating the kinematics and dynamics of the robot, this approach can simplify the control problem and allow for more efficient and robust control of the wheeled mobile robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7f16\u961f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5373\u53ef\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u72b6\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u5148\u9a8c\u6709\u754c\u7684\u6469\u64e6\u529b\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7f16\u961f\u63a7\u5236\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ba1\u7b97\u671f\u671b\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u63a7\u5236\u547d\u4ee4\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u52a8\uff08\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u6469\u64e6\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u9884\u8bbe\u5b89\u5168\u95f4\u8ddd\u4e0e\u7f16\u961f\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f6e\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7f16\u961f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u9762\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored.

Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8in-distribution\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u63d0\u5347out-of-distribution\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u5448\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u65ad\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ba1\u9053\uff08\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316ID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528ResNet-50\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u572856\u4e2aImageNet\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd521\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u540e\u5904\u7406OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u57288\u4e2aOOD\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "OOD\u6027\u80fd\u968fID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u5148\u589e\u540e\u964d\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u9760\u63d0\u5347ID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u9700\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs.

The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D.

This paper introduces BRIDGE, a system for bidirectional human-robot communication in physical assistance. Our method allows users to modify a robot's planned trajectory -- position, velocity, and force -- in real time using natural language. We utilize a large language model (LLM) to interpret any trajectory modifications implied by user commands in the context of the planned motion and conversation history. Importantly, our system provides verbal feedback in response to the user, either assuring any resulting changes or posing a clarifying question. We evaluated our method in a user study with 18 older adults across three assistive tasks, comparing BRIDGE to an ablation without verbal feedback and a baseline.

However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces.

Stereo cameras provide a low-cost means of directly estimating metric depth to support these tasks. However, despite recent advances in stereo depth estimation on land, computing depth from image pairs in underwater scenes remains challenging. In underwater environments, images are degraded by light attenuation, visual artifacts, and dynamic lighting conditions. Furthermore, real-world underwater scenes frequently lack rich texture useful for stereo depth estimation and 3D reconstruction. As a result, stereo estimation networks trained on in-air data cannot transfer directly to the underwater domain. In addition, there is a lack of real-world underwater stereo datasets for supervised training of neural networks. Poor underwater depth estimation is compounded in stereo-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, making it a fundamental challenge for underwater robot perception. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enables sim-to-real training of underwater stereo disparity estimation networks using simulated data and self-supervised finetuning. We leverage our learned depth predictions to develop \\algname, a novel framework for real-time underwater SLAM that fuses stereo cameras with IMU, barometric, and Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) measurements. Lastly, we collect a challenging real-world dataset of shipwreck surveys using an underwater robot. Our dataset features over 24,000 stereo pairs, along with high-quality, dense photogrammetry models and reference trajectories for evaluation.

However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt.

While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding.

However, state-of-the-art model-based planners for CRM are still focused on feasibility rather than optimality, limiting their ability to fully exploit CRM's advantages. We introduce a new paradigm that computes approximately optimal manipulator plans. This approach has two phases. Offline, we construct a graph of mutual reachable sets, where each set contains all object orientations reachable from a starting object orientation and grasp. Online, we plan over this graph, effectively computing and sequencing local plans for globally optimized motion. On a challenging, representative contact-rich task, our approach outperforms a leading planner, reducing task cost by 61%.

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline.

Conventional methods often rely on complex force sensing hardware that introduces control latency. This paper presents a minimalist framework utilizing a single, low cost Inertial-Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated into the crutch hand grip, eliminating the need for mechanical modifications. We propose a five phase classification system, including standard gait phases and a non locomotor auxiliary state, to prevent undesired motion. Three deep learning architectures were benchmarked on both a PC and an embedded system. To improve performance under data constrained conditions, models were augmented with a Finite State Machine (FSM) to enforce biomechanical consistency.

Compared to other fields of engineering where dual-use risks are present - e.g., those that underlie the development of weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons) and even the field of AI, robotics offers no specific regulation and little guidance as to how research and innovation may be conducted and disseminated responsibly.

Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "SGD\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u5766\u89e3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u673a\u5236\u88ab\u63ed\u793a\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51bb\u7ed3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "SGD\u4e3a\u4f55\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u5766\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u5176\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8d77\u6e90\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790SGD\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u6548\u52bf\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u77ac\u6001\u51bb\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "SGD\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u671f\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u4e2a\u8c37\u533a\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u56e0\u80fd\u91cf\u58c1\u5792\u589e\u5927\u800c\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e8e\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u5766\u6781\u5c0f\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u635f\u5931\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

End-to-end visuomotor policies bypass this structure, but often require large amounts of data, transfer poorly from simulation to reality, and generalize weakly across tasks/embodiments. We address those limitations by leveraging a simple insight: dexterous manipulation is inherently hierarchical - at a high level, a robot decides where to touch (geometry) and move the object (kinematics); at a low level it determines how to realize that plan through contact dynamics. Building on this insight, we propose a hierarchical RL--MPC framework in which a high-level reinforcement learning (RL) policy predicts a contact intention, a novel object-centric interface that specifies (i) an object-surface contact location and (ii) a post-contact object-level subgoal pose. Conditioned on this contact intention, a low-level contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) optimizes local contact modes and replans with contact dynamics to generate robot actions that robustly drive the object toward each subgoal. We evaluate the framework on non-prehensile tasks, including geometry-generalized pushing and object 3D reorientation. It achieves near-100% success with substantially reduced data (10x less than end-to-end baselines), highly robust performance, and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42RL-MPC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5c42\u63a5\u89e6\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u4f4e\u5c42\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5dee\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42RL-MPC\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9ad8\u5c42RL\u9884\u6d4b\u63a5\u89e6\u610f\u56fe\uff08\u63a5\u89e6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u59ff\uff09\uff0c\u4f4e\u5c42\u63a5\u89e6\u9690\u5f0fMPC\u4f18\u5316\u63a5\u89e6\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u975e\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u51cf\u5c1110\u500d\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002"}}

Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL.

This study focuses on the lowering phase of crane operation, the stage in which the load is moved to the desired location. During this phase, a constant challenge exists: the load obstructs the operator's view of the landing point. As a result, operators traditionally have to rely on verbal or gestural instructions from ground personnel, which significantly impacts site safety. To alleviate this constraint, the proposed system incorporates a attachable camera module designed to be attached directly to the load via a suction cup. This module houses a single-board computer, battery, and compact camera. After installation, it streams and processes images of the ground directly below the load in real time to generate installation guidance. Simultaneously, this guidance is transmitted to and monitored by a host computer. Preliminary experiments were conducted by attaching this module to a test object, confirming the feasibility of real-time image acquisition and transmission.

While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM.

Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise in instruction parsing and preliminary planning, they exhibit limitations in long-term reasoning and dynamic multi-robot coordination. We propose Hierarchical Autonomous Intelligent Multi-Robot Planning(H-AIM), a novel embodied multi-robot task planning framework that addresses these issues through a three-stage cascaded architecture: 1) It leverages an LLM to parse instructions and generate Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) problem descriptions, thereby transforming commands into formal planning problems; 2) It combines the semantic reasoning of LLMs with the search capabilities of a classical planner to produce optimized action sequences; 3) It compiles the resulting plan into behavior trees for reactive control. The framework supports dynamically sized heterogeneous robot teams via a shared blackboard mechanism for communication and state synchronization. To validate our approach, we introduce the MACE-THOR benchmark dataset, comprising 42 complex tasks across 8 distinct household layouts.

We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry.

To accomplish this task more effectively, robots need to actively adapt support strategies throughout the long-horizon assembly process, while also generalizing across diverse part geometries. We propose A3D, a framework which learns adaptive affordances to identify optimal support and stabilization locations on furniture parts. The method employs dense point-level geometric representations to model part interaction patterns, enabling generalization across varied geometries. To handle evolving assembly states, we introduce an adaptive module that uses interaction feedback to dynamically adjust support strategies during assembly based on previous interactions. We establish a simulation environment featuring 50 diverse parts across 8 furniture types, designed for dual-arm collaboration evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generalizes effectively to diverse part geometries and furniture categories in both simulation and real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faA3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u652f\u6491\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53cc\u81c2\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u88c5\u5bb6\u5177\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bb6\u5177\u7ec4\u88c5\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u800c\u8a00\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u53cc\u81c2\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u652f\u6491\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6837\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u88c5\u914d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "A3D\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u70b9\u4e91\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u90e8\u4ef6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u53cd\u9988\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u652f\u6491\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b50\u4e2a\u90e8\u4ef6\u30018\u7c7b\u5bb6\u5177\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cA3D\u5728\u591a\u6837\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u5bb6\u5177\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "A3D\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bb6\u5177\u7ec4\u88c5\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u652f\u6491\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u53cc\u81c2\u534f\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors.

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7701\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f3a\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982Spurious-Motif\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Spurious-Motif\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u7701\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8282\u70b9/\u8fb9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u53cd\u9988\u56de\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u6b21\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u5fae\u8c03\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u7701\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4e14\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

To the best of our knowledge, most of the existing TTA approaches modify the weights of the classifier relying heavily on the architecture. It is unclear as to how these approaches are extendable to generic architectures. In this article, we propose an architecture-agnostic approach to TTA by adding an adapter network pre-processing the input images suitable to the classifier.

This is a challenging problem, as the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires the seamless integration of sensing, estimation, and control, often treated separately in existing methods. State-of-the-art methods either impose linear-Gaussian assumptions to establish optimality or rely on approximations and heuristics, often without providing explicit performance guarantees. To address these limitations, we formulate the fire front monitoring task as a stochastic optimal control problem that integrates sensing, estimation, and control. We derive an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models. Subsequently, we transform the resulting nonlinear stochastic control problem into a finite-horizon Markov decision process and design an information-seeking predictive control law obtained via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u76d1\u6d4b\u91ce\u706b\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u91ce\u706b\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u968f\u673a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u76d1\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u692d\u5706\u589e\u957f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9012\u5f52\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u611f\u77e5-\u4f30\u8ba1-\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6e10\u8fd1\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u79bb\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback.

However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions.

To address this, we introduce VLAgents, a modular policy server that abstracts VLA inferencing behind a unified Gymnasium-style protocol. Crucially, its communication layer transparently adapts to the context by supporting both zero-copy shared memory for high-speed simulation and compressed streaming for remote hardware. In this work, we present the architecture of VLAgents and validate it by integrating seven policies -- including OpenVLA and Pi Zero. In a benchmark with both local and remote communication, we further demonstrate how it outperforms the default policy servers provided by OpenVLA, OpenPi, and LeRobot.

While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts.

In the problem, there is a set of users and services, each associated with a set of descriptive features. Interactions between users and services produce feedback values, typically represented as numerical QoS metrics such as response time or availability. Given the observed feedback for a subset of user-service pairs, the goal is to predict the QoS values for the remaining pairs.\n  A key challenge in QoS prediction is the inherent sparsity of user-service interactions, as only a small subset of feedback values is typically observed. To address this, we propose a self-augmented strategy that leverages a model's own predictions for iterative refinement. In particular, we partially mask the predicted values and feed them back into the model to predict again. Building on this idea, we design a self-augmented mixture-of-experts model, where multiple expert networks iteratively and collaboratively estimate QoS values. We find that the iterative augmentation process naturally aligns with the MoE architecture by enabling inter-expert communication: in the second round, each expert receives the first-round predictions and refines its output accordingly.

Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.", "AI": {"tldr": "VIGA\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u5199-\u8fd0\u884c-\u6e32\u67d3-\u6bd4\u8f83-\u4fee\u6b63\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u56fe\u5f62\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5b8c\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u5f62\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u9006\u56fe\u5f62\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "VIGA\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u5199-\u8fd0\u884c-\u6e32\u67d3-\u6bd4\u8f83-\u4fee\u6b63\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\uff08\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4ea4\u66ff\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u8ba1\u5212\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u6e32\u67d3\u5386\u53f2\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728BlenderGym\u548cSlideBench\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534735.32%\u548c117.17%\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6BlenderBench\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347124.70%\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784VLM\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "VIGA\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9006\u56fe\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u56fe\u5f62\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We investigate this phenomenon and identify a \"Perplexity Paradox\": spurious RLVR triggers a divergence where answer-token perplexity drops while prompt-side coherence degrades, suggesting the model is bypassing reasoning in favor of memorization. Using Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations, we uncover a hidden Anchor-Adapter circuit that facilitates this shortcut. We localize a Functional Anchor in the middle layers (L18-20) that triggers the retrieval of memorized solutions, followed by Structural Adapters in later layers (L21+) that transform representations to accommodate the shortcut signal. Finally, we demonstrate that scaling specific MLP keys within this circuit allows for bidirectional causal steering-artificially amplifying or suppressing contamination-driven performance.

We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers.

By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.

Such threats have become a significant web harm that erodes societal fairness and affects the well being of online communities. However, existing detection methods based on graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with two persistent challenges: (1) fraud camouflage, where malicious transactions mimic benign behaviors to evade detection, and (2) long-tailed data distributions, which obscure rare but critical fraudulent cases. To fill these gaps, we propose HIMVH, a Hippocampus-Inspired Multi-View Hypergraph learning model for web finance fraud detection. Specifically, drawing inspiration from the scene conflict monitoring role of the hippocampus, we design a cross-view inconsistency perception module that captures subtle discrepancies and behavioral heterogeneity across multiple transaction views. This module enables the model to identify subtle cross-view conflicts for detecting online camouflaged fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, inspired by the match-mismatch novelty detection mechanism of the CA1 region, we introduce a novelty-aware hypergraph learning module that measures feature deviations from neighborhood expectations and adaptively reweights messages, thereby enhancing sensitivity to online rare fraud patterns in the long-tailed settings.

Recent advancements have introduced explicit intermediary reasoning, such as sub-task prediction (language) or goal image synthesis (vision), to guide action generation. However, these intermediate reasoning are often indirect and inherently limited in their capacity to convey the full, granular information required for precise action execution. Instead, we posit that the most effective form of reasoning is one that deliberates directly in the action space. We introduce Action Chain-of-Thought (ACoT), a paradigm where the reasoning process itself is formulated as a structured sequence of coarse action intents that guide the final policy. In this paper, we propose ACoT-VLA, a novel architecture that materializes the ACoT paradigm. Specifically, we introduce two complementary components: an Explicit Action Reasoner (EAR) and Implicit Action Reasoner (IAR). The former proposes coarse reference trajectories as explicit action-level reasoning steps, while the latter extracts latent action priors from internal representations of multimodal input, co-forming an ACoT that conditions the downstream action head to enable grounded policy learning.

To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543).

By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples.

Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact.

A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49-\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MPNN\u4e0eTransformer\uff0c\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u52a8\u4f5c\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bed\u4e49-\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u7269\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u65f6\u5e8f\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528MPNN\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u8868\u793a\uff0cTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u7269\u7406\u53cc\u624b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u52a8\u4f5c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49-\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u56fe\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u3002"}}

Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\\% vs +1.4\\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks.

Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset.

A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties.

To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete.

However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU).

Despite its foundational importance, efficient algorithms for computing resistance distances on large graphs are still lacking. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including power iteration-based algorithms and random walk-based local approaches, often struggle with slow convergence rates, particularly when the condition number of the graph Laplacian matrix, denoted by $\u03ba$, is large. To tackle this challenge, we propose two novel and efficient algorithms inspired by the classic Lanczos method: Lanczos Iteration and Lanczos Push, both designed to reduce dependence on $\u03ba$. Among them, Lanczos Iteration is a near-linear time global algorithm, whereas Lanczos Push is a local algorithm with a time complexity independent of the size of the graph. More specifically, we prove that the time complexity of Lanczos Iteration is $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt\u03ba m)$ ($m$ is the number of edges of the graph and $\\tilde{O}$ means the complexity omitting the $\\log$ terms) which achieves a speedup of $\\sqrt\u03ba$ compared to previous power iteration-based global methods. For Lanczos Push, we demonstrate that its time complexity is $\\tilde{O}(\u03ba^{2.75})$ under certain mild and frequently established assumptions, which represents a significant improvement of $\u03ba^{0.25}$ over the SOTA random walk-based local algorithms.

Bauer", "Christian B\u00f6hm"], "title": "Clustering High-dimensional Data: Balancing Abstraction and Representation Tutorial at AAAI 2026", "comment": null, "summary": "How to find a natural grouping of a large real data set? Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering.

Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol.

Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns. Experiments on six datasets show that our approach produces higher-quality time series than existing methods.

Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures.

Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning.

Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ.

Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6TCS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u526a\u8f91\u7ea7\u6162\u901f-\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5e27\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4f4e\u6548", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u63a8\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4e92\u8865\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u526a\u8f91\u7ea7\u6162\u901f-\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u5e73\u8861\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587", "result": "\u5728MLVU\u3001LongVideoBench\u548cVideoMME\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad86.9%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1150%\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "TCS\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027"}}

Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module.

Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning.

However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features.

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is commonly used to update model knowledge, it often updates factual content without reliably improving the model's ability to use the newly incorporated information for question answering or decision-making. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points. PaST further scales to long-context QA on LooGLE with an 8.0-point absolute accuracy gain, and improves zero-shot ToolBench success rates by +10.3 points on average with consistent gains across tool categories, indicating strong scalability and cross-domain transferability of the Skill Vector.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPaST\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u77e5\u8bc6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0a\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSFT\u66f4\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f46\u4e0d\u63d0\u5347\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0cRL\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u5229\u7528SFT\u4e0eRL\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684Skill Vector\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cfSFT\u540e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u5728SQuAD\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf9.9\u5206\uff0cLooGLE\u63d0\u53478.0\u5206\uff0cToolBench\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534710.3\u5206\uff0c\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u5f3a", "conclusion": "PaST\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6280\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3aLLMs\u5728\u7ebf\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches.

However, existing methodologies struggle to combine geometric inductive biases with interpretable latent behavior, overlooking dynamics-driven features or disregarding spatial information. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Latent Dynamics Graph Convolutional Network (LD-GCN), a purely data-driven, encoder-free architecture that learns a global, low-dimensional representation of dynamical systems conditioned on external inputs and parameters. The temporal evolution is modeled in the latent space and advanced through time-stepping, allowing for time-extrapolation, and the trajectories are consistently decoded onto geometrically parameterized domains using a GNN. Our framework enhances interpretability by enabling the analysis of the reduced dynamics and supporting zero-shot prediction through latent interpolation. The methodology is mathematically validated via a universal approximation theorem for encoder-free architectures, and numerically tested on complex computational mechanics problems involving physical and geometric parameters, including the detection of bifurcating phenomena for Navier-Stokes equations.

However, achieving high-precision detection is challenging because PCB defects are typically characterized by tiny sizes, high texture similarity, and uneven scale distributions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on YOLOv11n, named SME-YOLO (Small-target Multi-scale Enhanced YOLO). First, we employ the Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss). This metric effectively mitigates the sensitivity of Intersection over Union (IoU) to positional deviations in tiny objects. Second, the original upsampling module is replaced by the Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB). By utilizing multi-scale convolutions, the EUCB gradually recovers spatial resolution and enhances the preservation of edge and texture details for tiny defects. Finally, this paper proposes the Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module. Tailored to the specific spatial distribution of PCB defects, this module adaptively strengthens perception within key scale intervals, achieving efficient fusion of local fine-grained features and global context information. Experimental results on the PKU-PCB dataset demonstrate that SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u8bc1\u8fd1\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u65e0\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65e0\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u6570\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u65e0\u5047\u8bbe\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u5c55"}}

Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5148\u9a8c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u3001\u4e8f\u683c\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7c97\u7ec6\u7b49\u5c5e\u6027", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u62d3\u6251\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u539a\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u4e0ePDE\u5e73\u6ed1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4fee\u6539\u4e0a\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u503c\uff0c\u5c06\u5bbd\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u5230\u53d8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u62d3\u6251\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u8fde\u63a5\u6027\u3001\u4e8f\u683c\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u7ebf\u6bb5\u7c97\u7ec6\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u7b49\u5bbd\u5ea6\u5c5e\u6027", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177"}}

Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs.

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSPREAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u56e0DLM\u4e0eLLM\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSPREAD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u951a\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "SPREAD\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff08RSD\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "DLMs\u7ed3\u5408RAG\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u673a\u5236\uff1bSPREAD\u4e3aDLM-RAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines.

The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1CPU\u529f\u8017\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u5e76\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u566a\u97f3\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u8df3\uff09\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Intel\u7684RAPL\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u529f\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6CPU\u529f\u8017\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness.

Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models.

Graph-based Markov decision processes (GMDPs) capture such settings via an influence graph, but standard critics are poorly aligned with this structure: global value functions provide weak per-agent learning signals, while existing local constructions can be difficult to estimate and ill-behaved in infinite-horizon settings. We introduce the Diffusion Value Function (DVF), a factored value function for GMDPs that assigns to each agent a value component by diffusing rewards over the influence graph with temporal discounting and spatial attenuation. We show that DVF is well-defined, admits a Bellman fixed point, and decomposes the global discounted value via an averaging property. DVF can be used as a drop-in critic in standard RL algorithms and estimated scalably with graph neural networks. Building on DVF, we propose Diffusion A2C (DA2C) and a sparse message-passing actor, Learned DropEdge GNN (LD-GNN), for learning decentralised algorithms under communication costs. Across the firefighting benchmark and three distributed computation tasks (vector graph colouring and two transmit power optimisation problems), DA2C consistently outperforms local and global critic baselines, improving average reward by up to 11%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570DVF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u5c40\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f31\u6216\u4f30\u8ba1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff08DVF\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u54cd\u56fe\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6298\u6263\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408GNN\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaDA2C\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0eLD-GNN_actor\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u706d\u706b\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDA2C\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe11%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "DVF\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316MARL\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations.

We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes.

UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation.

Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation.

In addition, a novel method for training the Lookup Tables (LUTs) in LUTNs is devised that uses the Boolean equation of a multiplexer (MUX). Additionally, rate coding was utilized for the first time in these LGNs and LUTNs, enhancing the performance of LGNs. Furthermore, it is the first time that LGNs and LUTNs have been benchmarked on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset using the inter-patient paradigm. Using an Artix 7 FPGA, between 2000 and 2990 LUTs were needed, and between 5 to 7 mW (i.e. 50 pJ to 70 pJ per inference) was estimated for running these models. The performance in terms of both accuracy and $j\u03ba$-index is significantly higher compared to previous LGN results. These positive results suggest that one can utilize LGNs and LUTNs for the detection of arrhythmias at extremely low power and high speeds in heart implants or wearable devices, even for patients not included in the training set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5728MIT-BIH\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b094.28%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u529f\u8017\u4f4e\u81f35-7mW\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u6216\u690d\u5165\u5f0f\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u6781\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u903b\u8f91\u95e8\u7f51\u7edc\uff08LGNs\uff09\u548c\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u7f51\u7edc\uff08LUTNs\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u578b\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u8def\u590d\u7528\u5668\u5e03\u5c14\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684LUT\u8bad\u7ec3\u6cd5\u53ca\u901f\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe94.28%\uff0c\u03ba\u6307\u65700.683\uff0cFLOPs\u4ec5\u4e3a2.89k\u20136.17k\uff0c\u529f\u80175\u20137mW\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LGNs\u548cLUTNs\u5177\u5907\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u3002"}}

We propose GenDA, a generative data assimilation framework that reconstructs high-resolution wind fields on unstructured meshes from limited observations. The model employs a multiscale graph-based diffusion architecture trained on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and interprets classifier-free guidance as a learned posterior reconstruction mechanism: the unconditional branch learns a geometry-aware flow prior, while the sensor-conditioned branch injects observational constraints during sampling. This formulation enables obstacle-aware reconstruction and generalization across unseen geometries, wind directions, and mesh resolutions without retraining. We consider both sparse fixed sensors and trajectory-based observations using the same reconstruction procedure. When evaluated against supervised graph neural network (GNN) baselines and classical reduced-order data assimilation methods, GenDA reduces the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE) by 25-57% and increases the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 23-33% across the tested meshes.

Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others.

We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization.

Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017CMOS\u8026\u5408\u632f\u8361\u5668Ising\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d0\u53d6\u5f0f\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u901f\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u5f0f\u6458\u8981\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u786c\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u786c\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684Ising\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u820d\u5165\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9002\u914dCOBI\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u6574\u6570\u8026\u5408\u4e0e\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728CNN/DailyMail\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCOBI\u5b9e\u73b03-4.5\u500d\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "CMOS Ising\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u5b9e\u65f6\u6458\u8981\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Conventional machine learning (ML) models are effective in several domains, yet they struggle to represent the complexities observed in smart grid systems. Furthermore, traditional ML models are highly susceptible to adversarial manipulations, making them increasingly unreliable for real-world deployment. Quantum ML (QML) provides a unique advantage, utilizing quantum-enhanced feature representations to model the intricacies of the high-dimensional nature of smart grid systems while demonstrating greater resilience to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we propose QUPID, a partitioned quantum neural network (PQNN) that outperforms traditional state-of-the-art ML models in anomaly detection. We extend our model to R-QUPID that even maintains its performance when including differential privacy (DP) for enhanced robustness. Moreover, our partitioning framework addresses a significant scalability problem in QML by efficiently distributing computational workloads, making quantum-enhanced anomaly detection practical in large-scale smart grid environments. Our experimental results across various scenarios exemplifies the efficacy of QUPID and R-QUPID to significantly improve anomaly detection capabilities and robustness compared to traditional ML approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faQUPID\u548cR-QUPID\u4e24\u79cd\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u533a\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PQNN\uff09\u67b6\u6784QUPID\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684R-QUPID\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5206\u533a\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cQUPID\u548cR-QUPID\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edfML\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aMetaboNet\u7684\u7edf\u4e00T1D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709T1D\u7ba1\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ed3\u6784\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u8bbf\u95ee\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00T1D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u5305\u542bCGM\u548c\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u6cf5\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u78b3\u6c34\u6444\u5165\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b49\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684MetaboNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "MetaboNet\u5305\u542b3135\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u30011228\u60a3\u8005\u5e74\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u9700DUA\u7533\u8bf7\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaboNet\u4e3aT1D\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.\n  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.\n  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model.
