### [1] [IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727)
*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个以印度次大陆为中心的大规模多模态基准IndicVisionBench，涵盖13种文化主题和10种印度语言，揭示现有视觉语言模型在文化多样性场景中的显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型评估基准以西方为中心，缺乏对文化多样性和多语言场景的覆盖，亟需一个聚焦印度次大陆的综合性评估框架。

Method: 构建IndicVisionBench基准，包含5K张图像和37K+问答对，覆盖OCR、MMT和VQA三种任务，涉及10种印度语言及英文，并发布平行注释语料。

Result: 在8种模型上实验发现，现有VLMs在非英文和文化特定任务中性能显著下降，暴露出强烈的文化与语言偏向。

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench为多模态研究提供了可复现的评估框架，推动更包容、多元的视觉语言模型发展。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

### [2] [Knowledge-based anomaly detection for identifying network-induced shape artifacts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04729)
*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于知识的异常检测方法，用于识别合成医学图像中的网络诱导形状伪影，显著提升合成数据质量评估能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据虽能缓解数据稀缺问题，但未经质量评估易引入伪影，影响模型性能与临床实用性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过分析解剖边界角度梯度分布构建专用特征空间，第二阶段使用隔离森林检测异常。

Result: 在两个合成乳腺X线数据集上，AUC分别达0.97和0.91；人类专家一致率提升1.5-2倍，Kendall-Tau相关系数为0.43-0.45。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效识别合成图像中的解剖约束违规，推动合成数据在临床场景中的负责任使用。

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Condition Preference Optimization (CPO)，通过优化控制信号而非生成图像来提升文本到图像生成的可控性，显著优于ControlNet++。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet++仅优化低噪声时间步，忽略高噪声贡献并引入近似误差；DPO因生成图像中其他因素干扰难以确保可控性唯一变化。

Method: 提出CPO：构建优劣控制信号 $/mathbf{c}^{w}$ 和 $/mathbf{c}^{l}$，直接在控制条件上进行偏好学习，避免图像级混淆因素。

Result: CPO在分割、人体姿态、边缘和深度图上均显著优于ControlNet++，误差率降低10%–80%，同时计算与存储成本更低。

Conclusion: CPO理论方差更低、实践效果更优，是高效提升文本到图像可控性的新范式。

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN通过动态正则化提升地理空间基础模型的适应性能，在全微调和高效适配两种范式下均达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配方法使用固定正则化策略，无法应对卫星图像的高度异质性。

Method: 提出DARN架构，包含任务复杂度预测器、自适应Dropout调制和动态容量门控三种创新机制。

Result: 全微调下GeoBench达86.66% mIoU（+5.56 pp），冻结主干下Sen1Floods11达90.5% mIoU，且在OOD泛化、鲁棒性和少数类性能上显著提升。

Conclusion: DARN为地理空间应用提供更智能、鲁棒且高效的FM适配方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次利用多卫星数据构建全球瞬时3D云图，准确重建强热带气旋结构，提升预报能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热带气旋预报受限于卫星观测不足和云物理过程解析困难，现有机器学习方法未针对强风暴验证

Method: 基于预训练-微调框架，整合全球多卫星影像，将2D图像转化为3D云特性地图

Result: 首次实现全球瞬时3D云图重建，准确还原强热带气旋结构，并能填补观测缺失

Conclusion: 该方法显著扩展卫星观测能力，有助于深化对气旋增强机制的理解并改进预报精度

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EETnet，一种可在嵌入式微控制器上运行的事件相机眼动追踪神经网络


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件相机的眼动追踪方法多依赖高性能GPU，缺乏在资源受限嵌入式设备上的实际部署

Method: 设计EETnet网络，采用分类与回归两种模式处理事件数据，并提出训练、评估与量化方法，基于公开数据集实现轻量化部署

Result: 成功实现可在微控制器上运行的事件驱动眼动追踪模型，支持实时低功耗应用

Conclusion: EETnet验证了事件相机在嵌入式眼动追踪中的可行性，为低功耗人机交互提供了实用方案

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

### [7] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出3D高斯点编码器，以显式高斯表示替代PointNet等隐式表示，实现更高效、轻量的3D识别模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D识别方法如PointNet依赖隐式表示，难以高效优化且计算开销大，需探索更高效的显式几何表示。

Method: 通过自然梯度和PointNet蒸馏学习3D高斯基底，结合3D高斯点云光栅化的过滤技术加速编码器，提升计算效率。

Result: 相比PointNet，该编码器速度提升2.7倍，内存降低46%，FLOPs减少88%；在Mamba3D中进一步降低42%内存与54% FLOPs，支持CPU实时运行。

Conclusion: 3D高斯点编码器作为显式表示，在保持精度的同时显著提升效率，为3D感知提供了轻量化新范式。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [8] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现Cellpose模型训练中存在大量数据冗余，仅用10%数据即可达到性能饱和，并提出基于DQ的重放策略有效缓解跨域微调中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用生物医学图像分割模型在跨域迁移中面临数据冗余与灾难性遗忘两大未充分探索的挑战。

Method: 提出数据量化（DQ）策略构建紧凑训练子集，结合MAE嵌入与t-SNE分析特征多样性，并通过跨域微调与选择性重放实验评估模型保留性能。

Result: 仅10%数据即可实现性能饱和；DQ选取的样本特征多样性优于随机采样；引入5-10%源域数据重放可有效恢复源域性能，完全重放反而阻碍目标域适应。

Conclusion: 生物医学图像分割应重视以数据为核心的设计，高效训练需结合紧凑子集、保留感知学习策略与合理的域顺序设计。

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [9] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于主动学习和伪标签的数据中心AI流程，结合基础模型与nnU-Net，显著减少人工标注需求并保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对噪声数据敏感，nnU-Net依赖大量标注数据，基础模型在特定数据集上表现不佳，亟需降低标注成本并提升泛化能力。

Method: 利用基础模型生成伪标签，引导nnU-Net自配置，并通过核心集选择进行最小化人工标注与微调。

Result: 在减少人工标注的情况下，保持了与全监督方法相当的分割性能。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一种高效、低标注成本的医学图像分割解决方案，推动AI技术在生物医学研究中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

*Manuel Weiß,Lukas Baumgärtner,Roland Herzog,Stephan Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于法向量先验知识的几何去噪新范式，通过标签向量集实现分割与去噪联合优化，采用Split Bregman方法求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统几何去噪方法未能有效利用表面法向量的先验结构信息，导致去噪后细节丢失或伪影。

Method: 引入标签向量集表征法向量先验，构建基于法向量相似性的分割模型，结合总变差正则化，并采用Split Bregman（ADMM）算法求解，顶点更新基于二阶形状微积分。

Result: 实现高效几何去噪，在保持几何细节的同时有效抑制噪声，分割与去噪协同优化。

Conclusion: 该方法通过法向量先验和优化框架，显著提升去噪性能，为几何处理提供新思路。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自监督的隐式自先验方法，从点云自身学习形状先验，结合隐式神经表示与RIMLS，提升表面重建质量与细节保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从不规则点云重建高质量表面是病态问题，需强几何先验，但现有方法依赖外部数据或无法有效处理稀疏区域。

Method: 通过联合训练可学习嵌入字典与隐式距离场，利用交叉注意力捕捉形状内部重复结构与长程相关性，仅用自监督重建损失优化，再通过自动微分提取稠密点与法向，融入RIMLS框架。

Result: 在保持输入细节的同时有效规整稀疏区域，重建结果在保真度、细节保留与抗噪声能力上优于经典与学习型方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部训练数据，能自适应学习形状先验，实现高质量、鲁棒的点云表面重建。

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Clinical-ComBAT方法，解决多中心DW-MRI数据的异构性问题，提升临床适用性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ComBAT方法受限于线性假设、固定站点和均匀人群，难以应用于真实临床场景

Method: 采用非线性多项式模型、独立站点校正、 Normative站点参考、自适应方差先验及超参数调优与拟合度评估

Result: 在模拟和真实数据中显著改善扩散指标对齐，增强规范建模的适用性

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT更适合真实临床环境，具备动态扩展性和更强的鲁棒性

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

TL;DR: Swin变压器在耳病诊断中表现优异，但数据泄漏问题导致性能大幅下降，强调数据处理在医疗AI中的关键性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于耳科专家误诊率达27%，亟需提升诊断准确性，探索视觉Transformer在耳病诊断中的潜力。

Method: 使用智利大学医院的真实耳镜视频数据，通过拉普拉斯和香农熵筛选帧，比较Swin v1/v2与ResNet模型的诊断准确率，并发现和纠正数据泄漏。

Result: 修正前Swin模型准确率超99%，修正后降至83%，ResNet为82%，证明数据泄漏严重影响结果可靠性。

Conclusion: 尽管Vision Transformer有潜力，但可靠的医疗AI模型需平衡先进架构与严谨的数据预处理，避免数据泄漏。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于卫星图像的地理深度学习模型，用Beta分布预测致命车祸风险，兼顾准确性与不确定性，显著提升召回率和校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通安全部门孤立分析风险因素，忽视空间复杂性；神经网络模型仅输出点估计，缺乏不确定性表征，限制了在关键决策中的应用。

Method: 利用卫星图像作为输入，构建地理深度学习框架，输出致命车祸风险的完整Beta概率分布，实现不确定性感知预测。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供安全导航支持，也为城市规划者和政策制定者提供可扩展、低成本、公平的交通安全管理工具。

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多仅处理单一退化，而真实图像常存在多种退化共存，导致实用性受限。

Method: 设计DIDBlock解耦退化成分，FBlock跨层级融合退化信息，TABlock动态选择恢复路径，构建IMDNet网络。

Result: IMDNet在多退化任务上性能优越，同时在单退化任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过解耦与自适应路径选择，IMDNet有效提升了复杂退化场景下的图像恢复效果。

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for

classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有被动检测方法难以应对新型深度伪造，而传统水印方法难平衡抗扰性与敏感性。

Method: 利用潜空间可学习水印嵌入器结合多智能体对抗强化学习（MAARL），通过对抗模拟器动态优化水印的鲁棒性与脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度伪造检测提供了可自适应、高鲁棒的水印新范式，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）因内存需求过高难以扩展至大场景，现有GPU显存容量不足。

Method: CLM通过智能卸载策略，将高斯点动态在CPU与GPU间调度，利用访问模式优化通信与计算流水线，减少通信量。

Result: 在单张RTX4090上成功渲染包含1亿个高斯点的大场景，重建质量达SOTA。

Conclusion: CLM有效突破3DGS的内存瓶颈，为消费级硬件运行大规模场景提供可行方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Result: 在OASIS-3、ADNI等数据集上取得SOTA结果：fMRI合成PSNR/SSIM达29.83 dB/90.84%，dMRI合成达30.00 dB/77.55%；临床诊断准确率67.92%/66.02%/64.15%（NC vs. MCI vs. AD）。

Conclusion: PDS有效解决模态缺失问题，为神经退行性疾病提供高保真合成MRI，推动临床应用。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

Motivation: 现有深度神经网络研究过度关注纹理，忽视了几何形状在视觉识别中的作用，亟需系统性地探查模型对形状的感知能力。

Method: 构建端到端可微框架，结合傅里叶级数参数化形状、基于绕数的像素映射及信号能量约束，实现高效且物理合理的形状优化。

Result: 生成的形状能触发高置信度分类、精准定位模型关注区域，并有效欺骗下游视觉任务，形成新型对抗范式。

Conclusion: 该框架为探索DNN的几何认知提供了通用工具，开辟了理解与挑战机器感知的新途径。

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

Conclusion: 该合成数据集为TDA神经网络模型的训练与评估提供了重要资源，突显了几何与拓扑复杂性共同影响模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are
available here.

Conclusion: 证明模态不平衡是关键问题，视觉信息注入文本可有效缓解，高级融合策略留待未来研究

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

Result: 在癌症分型、识别和突变预测任务中验证了DRE-SLCL的有效性。

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL有效克服了GPU内存限制，实现了高效端到端的全切片图像表示学习。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion是首个融合压力数据与语言先验的人体运动生成方法，为低侵入式运动捕捉开辟新路径。

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg通过简化架构与创新训练策略，为医学图像分割提供高效、可扩展的新范式。

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

Result: 在DrivingStereo和Waymo数据集上，PITTA显著优于现有SOTA方法，尤其在多变环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: PITTA为单目深度估计的时域自适应提供了高效、无需相机姿态信息的新范式，具备实际部署价值。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

Conclusion: 通过语义多样性驱动的合成数据生成，可在不增加数据量的前提下显著提升CLIP模型表现，为高效训练提供新路径。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment

*Mingyu Sheng,Jianan Fan,Dongnan Liu,Guoyan Zheng,Ron Kikinis,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SurgiATM模型，无需新增参数即可显著提升多种去烟方法的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜手术中热灼产生的烟雾会降低内窥镜图像质量，增加手术风险，需高效去烟。

Method: SurgiATM通过统计方式融合物理大气模型与深度学习模型，作为轻量级插件模块，不增加可训练参数。

Result: 在三个公开手术数据集上，针对十种去烟方法，SurgiATM普遍降低恢复误差并提升泛化性。

Conclusion: SurgiATM具有低开销、高有效性、强泛化性，易于部署，为临床去烟提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at
https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

TL;DR: 通过引入SMCE指标发现对抗样本对遮挡更敏感，并提出SWM-AED检测方法，在CIFAR-10上实现高达96.5%的检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升深度神经网络对对抗攻击的鲁棒性和检测能力，需理解对抗样本与干净样本的内在差异。

Method: 提出滑动遮罩置信度熵（SMCE）量化遮挡下模型置信度波动，并基于此设计滑动窗口遮罩对抗样本检测方法（SWM-AED）。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上使用1800+测试图像验证，对抗样本遮挡下置信度波动显著高于干净样本，SWM-AED检测准确率普遍超62%，最高达96.5%。

Conclusion: 对抗样本对遮挡更敏感，SWM-AED无需对抗训练即可高效检测对抗样本，具有强泛化性和实用价值。

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

TL;DR: 提出DPPP框架，通过双阶段提示驱动生成虚拟数据GenePerson并实现域不变特征学习，显著提升Re-ID模型泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有游戏引擎生成的虚拟数据构建复杂、泛化能力差，难以应用于实际场景。

Method: 双阶段提示驱动范式：第一阶段生成多维属性提示构建GenePerson数据集；第二阶段通过提示驱动解耦机制（PDM）结合对比学习分离风格与内容特征，引导模型学习域不变内容特征。

Result: 在GenePerson上训练的模型以PDM实现SOTA泛化性能，超越主流真实与虚拟Re-ID数据集。

Conclusion: DPPP有效解决了虚拟数据泛化难题，为隐私保护下的Re-ID提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

Result: 在多种恶劣天气场景下实现SOTA性能，支持连续适应真实环境。

Conclusion: 该方法无需配对监督，显著提升模型在真实复杂天气下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究依赖分层厚度测量，而早期检测需在临床诊断前数年通过OCT图像识别细微生物标志物，现有方法不足以应对这一挑战。

Method: 在UK Biobank队列上微调多种预训练模型（如ResNet-34、RETFound），使用个体水平交叉验证、OCT特异性增强和年份加权损失函数，降低小样本过拟合。

Result: ResNet-34表现最稳定，4年队列AUC为0.62；可解释性分析确认中央黄斑区结构差异显著。

Conclusion: 本研究为OCT基AD早期预测提供基线，凸显早期微弱生物标志物检测的难度，呼吁更大数据集与多模态方法。

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏视角下显著提升动态3D重建质量与效率，适用于影视制作等资源受限场景

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

Motivation: DINOv3虽能生成精细密集特征图，但依赖高分辨率输入和高昂的计算资源，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 提出BRIXEL，通过知识蒸馏使学生模型学习在较低分辨率输入下重现高分辨率特征图。

Result: BRIXEL在保持固定分辨率时显著超越DINOv3基线，在下游任务上取得更好性能，且计算成本大幅降低。

Conclusion: BRIXEL以极简设计实现了高效特征提取，为大规模视觉模型的轻量化部署提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code
and model weights are available at https://github.com/alexanderlappe/BRIXEL.

Result: 在三个主流基准上超越监督基线与通用病理基础模型。

Conclusion: MUSE有效解决病理图像核素检测与分类的核心挑战，无需强标注即可实现高性能核素表征学习。

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Conclusion: WtL2是一种适用于高精度分割场景的强有力方法，有望推动红外与RGB特定领域图像分割的进步。

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

Result: 实现了无需重训练的语义结构精确控制，生成质量高、稳定性好，支持直观的组合设计，仅增加约5%的推理成本。

Conclusion: FreeControl建立了测试时结构控制的新范式，在保持模型兼容性的同时，实现了高效、灵活、高保真的扩散图像生成控制。

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

Conclusion: 4D3R通过无姿态设计与高效动态表示，实现了高保真、低成本的动态场景新视角合成，推动了复杂动态内容的神经渲染进展。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

Conclusion: 专为异常检测设计的预训练表示能有效克服ImageNet预训练的局限性，推动AD领域发展。

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

TL;DR: 使用裁剪区域的3D U-Net在术中超声中实现结直肠肝转移瘤的自动分割，显著提升精度与速度，接近专家水平且无需注册。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中超声因对比度低、噪声大和操作者依赖性强，难以精确分割结直肠肝转移瘤，自动化分割可提升导航精度与效率。

Method: 基于nnU-Net框架，使用85例患者追踪的3D术中超声体积数据，比较全体积与肿瘤裁剪区域训练的3D U-Net模型，评估指标包括DSC、Hausdorff距离和相对体积差，并集成至3D Slicer实现术中实时应用。

Result: 裁剪模型性能显著优于全体积模型（AUC-ROC=0.898 vs 0.718），中位DSC=0.74，HDist=17.1mm，分割速度提升约4倍（约1分钟），术中测试验证其稳健性与临床可用性。

Conclusion: 基于裁剪3D U-Net的自动分割方法可实现近实时、高精度、低操作依赖的肝手术导航，显著减少人工工作量与手术时间，逼近专家水平。

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

Abstract: The analysis of character appearance frequency is essential for understanding
narrative structure, character prominence, and story progression in anime. In
this work, we introduce OregairuChar, a benchmark dataset designed for
appearance frequency analysis in the anime series My Teen Romantic Comedy
SNAFU. The dataset comprises 1600 manually selected frames from the third
season, annotated with 2860 bounding boxes across 11 main characters.
OregairuChar captures diverse visual challenges, including occlusion, pose
variation, and inter-character similarity, providing a realistic basis for
appearance-based studies. To enable quantitative research, we benchmark several
object detection models on the dataset and leverage their predictions for
fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This
approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within
the narrative. By emphasizing appearance frequency, OregairuChar serves as a
valuable resource for exploring computational narrative dynamics and
character-centric storytelling in stylized media.

TL;DR: DeepEyesV2通过两阶段训练和新基准RealX-Bench，实现了多模态智能体的工具调用与推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接强化学习无法有效诱导鲁棒的工具使用行为，需结合冷启动与强化学习两阶段训练。

Method: 构建了包含有益工具使用场景的数据集，提出两阶段训练流程，并设计RealX-Bench基准评估多模态推理能力。

Result: DeepEyesV2在RealX-Bench及其他基准上表现优异，能自适应调用图像处理和数值计算工具，并实现上下文感知的复杂工具组合。

Conclusion: 本研究为构建具备工具调用能力的多模态智能体提供了有效路径与评估标准。

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自报方法有回忆偏差，相机方法侵犯隐私，现有可穿戴方法难以覆盖中式饮食多样性。

Method: 采用两阶段管道：第一阶段通过IMU识别进食状态，第二阶段利用手部与头部动态进行细粒度食物分类。

Result: 在11类中式食物、10名参与者数据上验证，CuisineSense在进食检测和食物分类上均实现高精度。

Conclusion: CuisineSense提供了一种隐蔽、可穿戴的中式饮食监测解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

Method: 引入自适应流解码，包含增量视频-语言对齐、响应-静默解码框架及峰值-末端记忆压缩技术，提升推理速度与一致性。

Result: 在OmniStar数据集上，语义正确性提升19.5%，响应时间差降低18.1%，推理速度提升1.53倍（FPS+12.0%）。

Conclusion: LiveStar实现了真正的实时在线视频理解，为直播助手提供新范式，并发布首个多场景在线视频基准数据集。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的点云生成模型Diffusion Point Transformer和评估指标SNC，显著提升生成质量和评估鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Chamfer Distance的评估指标对缺陷不鲁棒，无法准确反映几何保真度和局部形状一致性

Method: 引入样本对齐和密度感知Chamfer距离(DCD)，提出表面法线一致性(SNC)新指标，并基于Transformer设计Diffusion Point Transformer生成模型

Result: 在ShapeNet上达到SOTA，生成质量显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 对齐+DCD+SNC构成更可靠的评估框架，Transformer架构有效提升点云生成保真度

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

Motivation: 传统隐写术难以嵌入语义丰富的句子级信息，而AIGC时代对隐写容量需求更高。

Method: 设计S²LM框架，利用LLM全程参与，将句子或段落语义嵌入图像，并构建IVT基准评估。

Result: 定量与定性实验表明S²LM能有效实现语义隐写，显著超越传统位级方法。

Conclusion: S²LM开创了LLM驱动的语义隐写新范式，为隐写术开辟新方向。

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视关节物体的时序动态特性，缺乏4D数据与基准数据集，限制了动态关节物体理解的发展

Method: 构建Artic4D数据集（含4D全景标注与关节参数），提出CanonSeg4D框架，通过估计帧间偏移映射到规范空间实现跨帧一致对齐

Result: 在Artic4D上，CanonSeg4D在复杂场景中显著超越现有方法，提升全景分割精度

Conclusion: 时序建模与规范对齐能有效提升动态关节物体感知，为4D关节物体感知开辟新方向

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

Conclusion: 该工作填补了3D动作理解的研究空白，为后续研究提供了高质量数据集与有效模型框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

Motivation: 现有多模态大模型在视觉质量评估中依赖监督微调或仅排序目标，导致推理浅层、评分校准差、跨域泛化弱。

Method: 引入双分支奖励机制，分离样本内响应一致性和样本间偏好对齐，采用GRPO优化，并设计时空数据流策略支持视频评估。

Result: 在10个IQA和5个VQA基准上实现SOTA，SRCC与PLCC分别提升5.30%和2.15%，并生成符合人类认知的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: PreResQ-R1通过强化学习实现可解释、稳定且泛化性强的视觉质量评估，为QA任务提供了新范式。

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a

TL;DR: MPRF通过融合视觉与LiDAR的Transformer基础模型，实现GNSS拒止环境下鲁棒的环路闭合检测，超越现有方法的精度与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS拒止环境（如行星探测）中，视觉PLACE识别因别名和弱纹理失效，LiDAR方法因稀疏性和模糊性表现不佳，亟需更鲁棒的环路闭合方案。

Method: MPRF提出多模态管道，结合DINOv2与SALAD进行两阶段视觉检索，使用SONATA描述符进行LiDAR几何验证，并集成6自由度位姿估计。

Result: 在S3LI和S3LI Vulcano数据集上，MPRF在精度和位姿鲁棒性上优于主流检索方法，提供可解释的对应关系，适合SLAM后端。

Conclusion: MPRF证明了基础模型能有效统一地点识别与位姿估计，实现精准、高效、可靠的环路闭合，具备广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and

*Aupendu Kar,Krishnendu Ghosh,Prabir Kumar Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需修改主干网络的卷积层简单改进方法，实现图像修复任务的持续学习，兼顾性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法在图像修复领域适用性差，因修复任务多变且图像大，传统正则化方法不适用，且需大量架构修改导致计算开销大。

Method: 通过修改卷积层引入轻量级参数，无需改动主干网络，即可复用历史任务知识，实现参数增长但计算开销不变。

Result: 在新增任务中保持原有任务性能，且新任务性能因历史知识迁移而提升，推理时间无显著增加。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像修复的持续学习提供了高效、通用的解决方案，可无缝集成至任意深度架构。

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/aupendu/continual-restore.

TL;DR: 提出基于HierSpeech++潜语音表征的文本到说话脸生成框架，无需真实音频即可实现高同步性和真实感的面部动画


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖真实音频或级联管道，导致音画同步差和身份保真度低

Method: 使用Text-to-Vec模块从文本生成Wav2Vec2嵌入，双阶段训练：先预训练于Wav2Vec2，再微调于TTS输出，联合条件控制语音与人脸生成

Result: 在无真实音频条件下，音画同步和视觉真实感优于级联方法

Conclusion: 潜语音表征联合建模有效提升文本驱动说话脸生成的质量与实用性

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

TL;DR: 提出gitmerge3D方法，通过图令牌合并减少90-95%令牌数量，显著提升3D点云变换器的效率而不牺牲性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D点云变换器依赖密集令牌表示，计算和内存开销大，而令牌存在显著冗余，导致效率低下。

Method: 引入gitmerge3D，一种全局感知的图令牌合并方法，动态减少令牌数量。

Result: 在多个3D视觉任务中，令牌数减少90-95%时仍保持竞争力性能，显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 挑战了“令牌越多性能越好”的假设，揭示当前模型过令牌化，为高效3D基础架构提供新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

TL;DR: 中分辨率Copernicus影像可用于快速大范围建筑损毁评估，开源数据集xBD-S12验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对自然灾害后急需快速损毁评估，但极高分辨率影像稀缺，需探索中分辨率影像的可行性。

Method: 构建xBD-S12数据集（10,315对Sentinel-1/2前后期影像），基于xBD基准评估多种模型对建筑损毁的检测与制图能力。

Result: 中分辨率影像（10米）可较好识别损毁，复杂模型泛化能力差，地理基础模型收益有限。

Conclusion: Copernicus影像可作为极高分辨率影像的重要补充，适用于大范围应急损毁评估。

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖场景信息，难以准确估计照片年份，尤其是多人图像；需更丰富的多人脸标注数据支持研究。

Method: 构建概率框架，融合现代人脸识别、年龄估计模型与职业时间先验，聚合多张人脸证据推断拍摄年份。

Result: 在CSFD-1.6M数据集上验证，多人脸信息聚合显著提升性能，优于强场景基线，尤其在多识别个体图像中效果突出。

Conclusion: 多人脸信息是提升照片年代估计的关键，所提方法与数据集为该领域提供了新范式与资源。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

TL;DR: 使用神经形态传感器实现流型分类，实现97.6%准确率和0.28ms延迟的实时热管理监控


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光学成像计算需求高、时间分辨率不足，难以捕捉瞬态流动行为，亟需高效实时监测方法

Method: 采用神经形态传感器获取事件型数据，构建五种分类模型（含LSTM），对比帧基与事件基方法的性能

Result: 事件基LSTM模型达到97.6%准确率，处理时间仅0.28ms，异步流水线结合多数投票实现稳定低延迟输出

Conclusion: 事件基传感方法显著优于传统帧基方法，为高精度实时热管理系统提供了可行方案

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种结合语义引导自然语言处理与视觉识别骨干网络的跨模态微小目标检测方法，在COCO和Objects365数据集上实现SOTA性能，参数量仅为Transformer模型的一半。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测方法在微小物体和复杂场景中精度不足，且Transformer模型参数量大、计算成本高，亟需高效精准的跨模态检测方案。

Method: 融合BERT语义模型与PRB-FPN-Net视觉骨干，引入ELAN、MSP、CSP架构优化特征提取与融合，并通过词形还原与微调实现文本-视觉语义对齐。

Result: 在COCO2017验证集上达到52.6% AP，显著优于YOLO-World，参数量仅为GLIP等Transformer模型的一半，具备高效多尺度检测能力。

Conclusion: 语义引导与高效骨干网络的结合显著提升微小目标检测的精度与效率，为资源受限环境下的实用化提供了新范式。

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of
backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of
multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in
resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of
integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone
architectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency,
and adaptability to real-world challenges.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupKAN通过分组Kolmogorov-Arnold网络在医学图像分割中实现更高精度、更少参数和更好可解释性，超越U-KAN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卷积和Transformer架构在非线性适应性、决策透明性和计算复杂度上存在缺陷，U-KAN虽改进但仍受通道数二次复杂度限制。

Method: 提出GroupKAN，包含分组KAN变换（将通道分组降低复杂度至O(C²/G)）和分组KAN激活（共享样条映射实现高效非线性）。

Result: 在BUSI、GlaS、CVC三个医学数据集上，GroupKAN平均IoU达79.80%，比U-KAN高1.11%，参数量仅为47.6%（3.02M vs 6.35M）。

Conclusion: GroupKAN在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算开销并提升可解释性，是轻量级医学图像分割的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工设计的搜索流程，缺乏端到端优化，导致搜索策略低效且推理不一致。

Method: 引入GRPO-CSV，通过同模型自验证搜索帧的完备性，并构建高难度时序依赖数据集用于SFT和RL训练。

Result: 在Haystack-LVBench、Haystack-Ego4D、VideoMME、MLVU和LongVideoBench上显著超越基线，LongVideoBench上比Qwen2.5-VL高4.1%，比Video-R1高2.0%。

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R通过交互式推理与自验证机制有效提升了长视频时序搜索的准确性与完备性，为视频理解提供新范式。

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法通过添加专家编码器增强空间感知，但带来额外开销并损害通用能力，亟需一种高效且通用的空间能力提升方法

Method: 构建大规模空间感知数据集VST-P（410万样本）和空间推理数据集VST-R（13.5万样本），采用监督微调与强化学习的渐进式训练范式

Result: 在MMSI-Bench上达到34.8%，在VSIBench上达到61.2%，均取得SOTA，且未牺牲模型通用能力

Conclusion: VST为视觉语言行动模型提供了物理 grounded 的新路径，推动更接近人类的视觉空间智能发展

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

Motivation: 多臂机器人因人类般的协同能力而有吸引力，但传统TAMP算法仅支持单臂运动，无法高效处理并行动作导致的复杂混合动作空间。

Method: ScheduleStream采用混合持续性动作建模时间动态，支持异步启动与参数化持续时间，提出通用域无关算法，并结合GPU加速采样以提升规划效率。

Result: 在仿真中优于多种消融方法，生成更高效解；并在真实双臂机器人任务中成功验证。

Conclusion: ScheduleStream是首个通用并行任务与运动规划调度框架，为多臂机器人高效执行复杂任务提供了新路径。

Abstract: Bimanual and humanoid robots are appealing because of their human-like
ability to leverage multiple arms to efficiently complete tasks. However,
controlling multiple arms at once is computationally challenging due to the
growth in the hybrid discrete-continuous action space. Task and Motion Planning
(TAMP) algorithms can efficiently plan in hybrid spaces but generally produce
plans, where only one arm is moving at a time, rather than schedules that allow
for parallel arm motion. In order to extend TAMP to produce schedules, we
present ScheduleStream, the first general-purpose framework for planning &
scheduling with sampling operations. ScheduleStream models temporal dynamics
using hybrid durative actions, which can be started asynchronously and persist
for a duration that's a function of their parameters. We propose
domain-independent algorithms that solve ScheduleStream problems without any
application-specific mechanisms. We apply ScheduleStream to Task and Motion
Planning & Scheduling (TAMPAS), where we use GPU acceleration within samplers
to expedite planning. We compare ScheduleStream algorithms to several ablations
in simulation and find that they produce more efficient solutions. We
demonstrate ScheduleStream on several real-world bimanual robot tasks at

Conclusion: ReGen通过自动化仿真设计显著推动了机器人学习的可扩展性、泛化性与鲁棒性，为仿真驱动的机器人研究提供了新范式。

Abstract: Simulation plays a key role in scaling robot learning and validating
policies, but constructing simulations remains a labor-intensive process. This
paper introduces ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates
simulation design via inverse design. Given a robot's behavior -- such as a
motion trajectory or an objective function -- and its textual description,
ReGen infers plausible scenarios and environments that could have caused the
behavior. ReGen leverages large language models to synthesize scenarios by
expanding a directed graph that encodes cause-and-effect relationships,
relevant entities, and their properties. This structured graph is then
translated into a symbolic program, which configures and executes a robot
simulation environment. Our framework supports (i) augmenting simulations based
on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation,
(iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning
with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We
demonstrate ReGen in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks,
generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing
simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for
corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and
supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for
improved generalization and robustness. We provide code and example videos at:

Motivation: 传统模仿学习忽视感官输入、动作与奖励间的多模态交互，难以建模复杂机器人行为。

Method: 采用随机部分掩码的扩散模型，训练其重建完整轨迹，学习时间与跨模态依赖关系。

Result: 在仿真与真实接触丰富任务中，MDF表现出优异性能、鲁棒性及多功能性。

Conclusion: MDF为多模态机器人轨迹学习提供了统一且高效的框架，显著提升对复杂任务的理解与泛化能力。

Abstract: Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning
approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB
images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay
between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which
is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this
work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning
from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation.
Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking
and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training
objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies,
such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states
from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful
manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show
that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong
performance, and robustness under noisy observations. More visualizations can

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学计算中的可重复性危机导致70%的机器人算法无法被复现，多语言和软硬件工具链的碎片化造成依赖混乱，阻碍了研究部署。

Method: Pixi通过项目级锁文件捕获精确依赖状态，集成conda-forge与PyPI生态，并利用高性能SAT求解器实现快速依赖解析。

Result: 自2023年以来已被5300多个项目采用，将设置时间从数小时缩短至数分钟，大幅降低技术门槛。

Conclusion: Pixi构建了可扩展、可复现、可协作的研究基础设施，推动机器人与AI领域的研究进展。

Abstract: The reproducibility crisis in scientific computing constrains robotics
research. Existing studies reveal that up to 70% of robotics algorithms cannot
be reproduced by independent teams, while many others fail to reach deployment
because creating shareable software environments remains prohibitively complex.
These challenges stem from fragmented, multi-language, and hardware-software
toolchains that lead to dependency hell. We present Pixi, a unified
package-management framework that addresses these issues by capturing exact
dependency states in project-level lockfiles, ensuring bit-for-bit
reproducibility across platforms. Its high-performance SAT solver achieves up
to 10x faster dependency resolution than comparable tools, while integration of
the conda-forge and PyPI ecosystems removes the need for multiple managers.
Adopted in over 5,300 projects since 2023, Pixi reduces setup times from hours
to minutes and lowers technical barriers for researchers worldwide. By enabling
scalable, reproducible, collaborative research infrastructure, Pixi accelerates
progress in robotics and AI.

Abstract: We present Isaac Lab, the natural successor to Isaac Gym, which extends the
paradigm of GPU-native robotics simulation into the era of large-scale
multi-modal learning. Isaac Lab combines high-fidelity GPU parallel physics,
photorealistic rendering, and a modular, composable architecture for designing

framework integrates actuator models, multi-frequency sensor simulation, data
collection pipelines, and domain randomization tools, unifying best practices
for reinforcement and imitation learning at scale within a single extensible
platform. We highlight its application to a diverse set of challenges,
including whole-body control, cross-embodiment mobility, contact-rich and
dexterous manipulation, and the integration of human demonstrations for skill
acquisition. Finally, we discuss upcoming integration with the differentiable,
GPU-accelerated Newton physics engine, which promises new opportunities for
scalable, data-efficient, and gradient-based approaches to robot learning. We
believe Isaac Lab's combination of advanced simulation capabilities, rich

Motivation: 传统均匀采样在复杂环境中效率低、规划慢，亟需更高效的采样策略

Method: 通过启发式路径预测器生成初始路径，结合共形预测量化不确定性，构建高概率包含最优解的认证区域，并据此引导非均匀采样

Result: 在多种环境中 faster find feasible paths, 且泛化能力优于基线方法

Conclusion: 首次为SBMPs提供概率正确保证的非均匀采样方法，有效提升规划效率与鲁棒性

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are widely used to compute dynamically
feasible robot paths. However, their reliance on uniform sampling often leads
to poor efficiency and slow planning in complex environments. We introduce a
novel non-uniform sampling strategy that integrates into existing SBMPs by
biasing sampling toward `certified' regions. These regions are constructed by
(i) generating an initial, possibly infeasible, path using any heuristic path
predictor (e.g., A* or vision-language models) and (ii) applying conformal
prediction to quantify the predictor's uncertainty. This process yields
prediction sets around the initial-guess path that are guaranteed, with
user-specified probability, to contain the optimal solution. To our knowledge,
this is the first non-uniform sampling approach for SBMPs that provides such
probabilistically correct guarantees on the sampling regions. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently finds feasible paths
faster and generalizes better to unseen environments than existing baselines.

Motivation: 太阳能板因灰尘覆盖或太空碎片撞击可能导致关键任务中断，需有效清洁与防护方案。

Method: 对比了刷式与轨道式清洁系统，并通过碰撞测试评估多种防护材料的性能。

Result: 刷式系统在成本、清洁速度和功耗方面优于轨道系统；聚碳酸酯需与软材料层叠使用才能达到最佳防护效果。

Conclusion: 刷式清洁机制与软硬复合防护层是提升太阳能板在恶劣环境中可靠性的有效策略。

Abstract: Solar energy is used for many mission-critical applications including space
exploration, sensor systems to monitor wildfires, etc. Their operation can be
limited or even terminated if solar panels are covered with dust or hit by
space debris. To address this issue, we designed panel cleaning mechanisms and
tested protective materials. For cleaning mechanisms, we designed and compared
a wiper system and a rail system. For protective materials, we found through
collision tests that polycarbonate was very promising, though the most
important factor was layering a soft material between the panel's surface and a
hard material. In the cleaning system comparisons, the wiper-based system was
more efficient than the rail-based system in terms of cost, cleaning speed, and
total power consumption.

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLM, a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (VLM) used
to improve the domain of Embodied Intelligence. The central objective of
iFlyBot-VLM is to bridge the cross-modal semantic gap between high-dimensional
environmental perception and low-level robotic motion control. To this end, the
model abstracts complex visual and spatial information into a body-agnostic and
transferable Operational Language, thereby enabling seamless perception-action
closed-loop coordination across diverse robotic platforms. The architecture of
iFlyBot-VLM is systematically designed to realize four key functional
capabilities essential for embodied intelligence: 1) Spatial Understanding and
Metric Reasoning; 2) Interactive Target Grounding; 3) Action Abstraction and
Control Parameter Generation; 4) Task Planning and Skill Sequencing. We
envision iFlyBot-VLM as a scalable and generalizable foundation model for
embodied AI, facilitating the progression from specialized task-oriented
systems toward generalist, cognitively capable agents. We conducted evaluations
on 10 current mainstream embodied intelligence-related VLM benchmark datasets,
such as Blink and Where2Place, and achieved optimal performance while
preserving the model's general capabilities. We will publicly release both the
training data and model weights to foster further research and development in
the field of Embodied Intelligence.

Conclusion: TBPS2有效提升了位置同步精度与系统稳定性，同时减少稳定器的保守性，适用于高精度人机交互场景。

Abstract: Maintaining system stability and accurate position tracking is imperative in
networked robotic systems, particularly for haptics-enabled human-robot
interaction. Recent literature has integrated human biomechanics into the
stabilizers implemented for teleoperation, enhancing force preservation while
guaranteeing convergence and safety. However, position desynchronization due to
imperfect communication and non-passive behaviors remains a challenge. This
paper proposes a two-port biomechanics-aware passivity-based synchronizer and
stabilizer, referred to as TBPS2. This stabilizer optimizes position
synchronization by leveraging human biomechanics while reducing the
stabilizer's conservatism in its activation. We provide the mathematical design
synthesis of the stabilizer and the proof of stability. We also conducted a
series of grid simulations and systematic experiments, comparing their
performance with that of state-of-the-art solutions under varying time delays
and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: MoE-DP显著增强鲁棒性与可解释性，支持推理时子任务重排，无需重训练，为复杂机器人控制提供新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a powerful framework for robotic
visuomotor control, yet they often lack the robustness to recover from subtask
failures in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks and their learned representations
of observations are often difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose the
Mixture of Experts-Enhanced Diffusion Policy (MoE-DP), where the core idea is
to insert a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between the visual encoder and the
diffusion model. This layer decomposes the policy's knowledge into a set of
specialized experts, which are dynamically activated to handle different phases
of a task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MoE-DP exhibits a
strong capability to recover from disturbances, significantly outperforming
standard baselines in robustness. On a suite of 6 long-horizon simulation
tasks, this leads to a 36% average relative improvement in success rate under
disturbed conditions. This enhanced robustness is further validated in the real
world, where MoE-DP also shows significant performance gains. We further show
that MoE-DP learns an interpretable skill decomposition, where distinct experts
correspond to semantic task primitives (e.g., approaching, grasping). This
learned structure can be leveraged for inference-time control, allowing for the
rearrangement of subtasks without any re-training.Our video and code are

Abstract: Centralized Multiport Networked Dynamic (CMND) systems have emerged as a key
architecture with applications in several complex network systems, such as
multilateral telerobotics and multi-agent control. These systems consist of a
hub node/subsystem connecting with multiple remote nodes/subsystems via a
networked architecture. One challenge for this system is stability, which can
be affected by non-ideal network artifacts. Conventional passivity-based
approaches can stabilize the system under specialized applications like
small-scale networked systems. However, those conventional passive stabilizers
have several restrictions, such as distributing compensation across subsystems
in a decentralized manner, limiting flexibility, and, at the same time, relying
on the restrictive assumptions of node passivity. This paper synthesizes a
centralized optimal passivity-based stabilization framework for CMND systems.
It consists of a centralized passivity observer monitoring overall energy flow
and an optimal passivity controller that distributes the just-needed
dissipation among various nodes, guaranteeing strict passivity and, thus, L2
stability. The proposed data-driven model-free approach, i.e., Tunable
Centralized Optimal Passivity Control (TCoPC), optimizes total performance
based on the prescribed dissipation distribution strategy while ensuring
stability. The controller can put high dissipation loads on some sub-networks
while relaxing the dissipation on other nodes. Simulation results demonstrate
the proposed frameworks performance in a complex task under different
time-varying delay scenarios while relaxing the remote nodes minimum phase and
passivity assumption, enhancing the scalability and generalizability.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in complex, constrained spaces is vital for widespread
applications but challenging, particularly when navigating narrow passages with
elongated objects. Existing planning methods often fail in these low-clearance
scenarios due to the sampling difficulties or the local minima. This work
proposes Topology-Aware Planning for Object Manipulation (TAPOM), which
explicitly incorporates task-space topological analysis to enable efficient
planning. TAPOM uses a high-level analysis to identify critical pathways and
generate guiding keyframes, which are utilized in a low-level planner to find
feasible configuration space trajectories. Experimental validation demonstrates
significantly high success rates and improved efficiency over state-of-the-art
methods on low-clearance manipulation tasks. This approach offers broad
implications for enhancing manipulation capabilities of robots in complex

Conclusion: 分阶段建模与多视觉先验结合显著提升物体操作性能，所提方法与数据集为该领域提供新基准。

Abstract: Object manipulation, which focuses on learning to perform tasks on similar
parts across different types of objects, can be divided into an approaching
stage and a manipulation stage. However, previous works often ignore this
characteristic of the task and rely on a single policy to directly learn the
whole process of object manipulation. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Dual-Actor Policy, termed DAP, which explicitly considers different
stages and leverages heterogeneous visual priors to enhance each stage.
Specifically, we introduce an affordance-based actor to locate the functional
part in the manipulation task, thereby improving the approaching process.
Following this, we propose a motion flow-based actor to capture the movement of
the component, facilitating the manipulation process. Finally, we introduce a
decision maker to determine the current stage of DAP and select the
corresponding actor. Moreover, existing object manipulation datasets contain
few objects and lack the visual priors needed to support training. To address
this, we construct a simulated dataset, the Dual-Prior Object Manipulation
Dataset, which combines the two visual priors and includes seven tasks,
including two challenging long-term, multi-stage tasks. Experimental results on
our dataset, the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world scenarios illustrate that
our method consistently outperforms the SOTA method by 5.55%, 14.7% and 10.4%
on average respectively.

Abstract: Autonomous micro-mobility platforms face challenges from the perspective of

progressed significantly, optimizing user comfort and overall user experience
over other typical metrics in robotics (e.g., time or distance traveled) is
understudied. Specifically, these metrics are critical in commercial
applications. In this paper, we show how imitation learning delivers smoother

controllers. We demonstrate how DAAV's autonomous wheelchair achieves
state-of-the-art comfort in follow-me mode, in which it follows a human
operator assisting persons with reduced mobility (PRM). This paper analyzes
different neural network architectures for end-to-end control and demonstrates
their usability in real-world production-level deployments.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous systems has experienced remarkable growth in

Abstract: Robots operating in complex and uncertain environments face considerable
challenges. Advanced robotic systems often rely on extensive datasets to learn
manipulation tasks. In contrast, when humans are faced with unfamiliar tasks,
such as assembling a chair, a common approach is to learn by watching video
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning robot
policies by Retrieving-from-Video (RfV), using analogies from human
demonstrations to address manipulation tasks. Our system constructs a video
bank comprising recordings of humans performing diverse daily tasks. To enrich
the knowledge from these videos, we extract mid-level information, such as
object affordance masks and hand motion trajectories, which serve as additional
inputs to enhance the robot model's learning and generalization capabilities.
We further feature a dual-component system: a video retriever that taps into an
external video bank to fetch task-relevant video based on task specification,
and a policy generator that integrates this retrieved knowledge into the
learning cycle. This approach enables robots to craft adaptive responses to
various scenarios and generalize to tasks beyond those in the training data.
Through rigorous testing in multiple simulated and real-world settings, our
system demonstrates a marked improvement in performance over conventional
robotic systems, showcasing a significant breakthrough in the field of
robotics.

Abstract: Today's autonomous agents can understand free-form natural language
instructions and execute long-horizon tasks in a manner akin to human-level
reasoning. These capabilities are mostly driven by large-scale pre-trained
foundation models (FMs). However, the approaches with which these models are
grounded for human-robot interaction (HRI) perpetuate a master-apprentice
model, where the apprentice (embodied agent) passively receives and executes
the master's (human's) commands without reciprocal learning. This reactive
interaction approach does not capture the co-adaptive dynamics inherent in
everyday multi-turn human-human interactions. To address this, we propose a
Symbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach that enables both the master and
the apprentice to co-adapt through mutual, bidirectional interactions. We
formalised SIL as a co-adaptation process within a shared latent task space,
where the agent and human maintain joint belief states that evolve based on
interaction history. This enables the agent to move beyond reactive execution
to proactive clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement.
To realise these novel behaviours, we leveraged pre-trained FMs for spatial
perception and reasoning, alongside a lightweight latent encoder that grounds
the models' outputs into task-specific representations. Furthermore, to ensure
stability as the tasks evolve, we augment SIL with a memory architecture that
prevents the forgetting of learned task-space representations. We validate SIL
on both simulated and real-world embodied tasks, including instruction
following, information retrieval, query-oriented reasoning, and interactive
dialogues. Demos and resources are public

TL;DR: 提出M3GN方法，通过元学习和运动基元实现高效高精度的物体变形模拟


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图网络模拟器依赖单步观测，无法捕捉时间上下文，难以推断材料属性，且自回归 rollout 导致误差累积

Method: 将网格模拟视为轨迹级元学习问题，使用条件神经过程快速适应新场景，并通过运动基元单次模型调用预测稳定模拟

Result: M3GN在多个任务上相比最先进GNS显著提升精度，同时大幅降低运行成本

Conclusion: M3GN为物体变形模拟提供了一种高效、准确的新范式，适合机器人操作和制造优化等应用

Abstract: Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific
domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned
Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional
mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make
them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate
simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization.
However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step
observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without
this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties.
Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error
for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a
trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our
method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited
initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize
movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations
from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive
Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of
the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.

TL;DR: TwinVLA通过组合两个预训练单臂VLA实现高效双臂操作，无需额外双臂数据即可超越单体模型并逼近顶尖性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公有数据集多为单臂演示，导致VLA适配双臂任务需大量双臂数据与微调，成本高且不高效。

Method: 提出TwinVLA框架，模块化地组合两个预训练单臂VLA，形成协调的双臂策略，无需重新预训练。

Result: 在真实与仿真双臂任务中，TwinVLA超越同等规模的RDT-1B模型，并显著缩小与依赖私有数据的$eta_0$模型的性能差距。

Conclusion: 模块化组合预训练单臂模型是数据高效、可扩展的双臂操作实现路径，充分利用公有单臂数据。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) trained on large-scale robotic datasets
have demonstrated strong performance on manipulation tasks, including bimanual
tasks. However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm
demonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial
additional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we
introduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained
single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic
cross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data,
TwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained
single-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation
settings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model
without requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to
state-of-the-art model, $\pi_0$ which rely on extensive proprietary bimanual
data and compute cost. These results establish our modular composition approach
as a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual
manipulation, leveraging public single-arm data.

Abstract: Soft robot manipulators have the potential for deployment in delicate
environments to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, existing obstacle
detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that
manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work
introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e.
positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's
joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate
limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space
obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the
manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations
classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby
allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot
manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware
experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results
demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during
interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for
real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VR系统缺乏真实、安全的社交触觉交互，亟需一种能模拟自然身体接触的动态触觉显示方案。

Method: 集成扭矩控制机械臂、可更换被动道具（硅胶手模和球棒）、基于ChArUco板的物理-虚拟注册和基于头手位姿的安全监控，并提出静态与动态两种控制策略。

Result: 静态定位精度为5.09±0.94 mm，接触延迟平均为28.53±31.21 ms，验证了系统在社交触觉重建中的可行性。

Conclusion: ETHOS通过安全与动态控制机制，为VR中高保真人际交互建立了实用基础。

Abstract: We present ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social Interaction),
a dynamic encountered-type haptic display (ETHD) that enables natural physical
contact in virtual reality (VR) during social interactions such as handovers,
fist bumps, and high-fives. The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic
manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a
baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a
safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We
introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary
prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD
baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by
exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand
tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests
show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions
achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21
ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the
feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating
essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical
foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual
environments.

Motivation: 提升四足机器人在动态运动中的稳定性与生物合理性，借鉴自然生物的跳跃行为

Method: 将机器人建模为SLIP系统，利用能量守恒原理计算稳定抛物线轨迹，控制腿部姿态与长度

Result: 在Minitaur机器人仿真中成功生成稳定跳跃步态，并在传感器误差达10%时仍保持鲁棒性

Conclusion: 所提控制架构能有效实现稳定、鲁棒的动态步态，适用于实际四足机器人系统

Abstract: In this paper, we present an energy-conservation based control architecture
for stable dynamic motion in quadruped robots. We model the robot as a
Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), a model well-suited to represent the
bouncing motion characteristic of running gaits observed in various biological
quadrupeds and bio-inspired robotic systems. The model permits leg-orientation
control during flight and leg-length control during stance, a design choice
inspired by natural quadruped behaviors and prevalent in robotic quadruped
systems. Our control algorithm uses the reduced-order SLIP dynamics of the
quadruped to track a stable parabolic spline during stance, which is calculated
using the principle of energy conservation. Through simulations based on the
design specifications of an actual quadruped robot, Ghost Robotics Minitaur, we
demonstrate that our control algorithm generates stable bouncing gaits.
Additionally, we illustrate the robustness of our controller by showcasing its
ability to maintain stable bouncing even when faced with up to a 10% error in
sensor measurements.

TL;DR: 柔性四旋翼FlexiQuad在保持敏捷飞行性能的同时，大幅提升了抗撞性和可压缩性，突破传统刚性框架的限制。


<details>

Motivation: 传统刚性四旋翼在复杂环境中抗撞性和通过狭窄空间能力受限，而生物飞行器的软翼结构启发了更优异的飞行性能设计。

Method: 提出FlexiQuad柔性框架设计，利用各向异性刚度与质量能量分布结构，构建轻量级（405克）高柔顺性飞行器。

Result: FlexiQuad柔顺性比传统设计高三个数量级，可实现80 km/h速度、3g线加速度与300 rad/s²角加速度，抗撞能力提升4倍，可通过窄至70%自身宽度的缝隙。

Conclusion: 在0.006–0.77 N/mm的软度范围内，FlexiQuad实现了敏捷性、可压缩性与抗撞性的协同优化，拓展了无人机在复杂环境中的应用边界。

Abstract: Natural flyers use soft wings to seamlessly enable a wide range of flight
behaviours, including agile manoeuvres, squeezing through narrow passageways,
and withstanding collisions. In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely
on rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision
resilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in
cluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed
mass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce
FlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off.
We demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more
compliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres
with peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3
g and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate
accelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.
Simultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience,
surviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising
forces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress,
enabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our
analysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77
N/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility,
squeezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad
models from 20 to 3000 grams. FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in
complex environments, enabling robust physical interactions without
compromising flight performance.

*Pratik Poudel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KV缓存管理需保护位置编码一致性，简单保留连续上下文块比复杂剔除策略更有效


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存无界增长导致模型生成质量下降，现有策略忽略位置编码完整性问题

Method: 使用有状态基准测试框架，分析不同缓存剔除策略对Llama 3等模型生成质量的影响

Result: 当KV缓存接近或超过模型上下文窗口时生成质量急剧下降；保留连续上下文块优于高保留率但破坏位置一致性的策略

Conclusion: 缓存管理应尊重模型架构限制，维持位置编码结构，从整体上评估缓存健康而非仅关注大小

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in
large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn
scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between
KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of
positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking
framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the
accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window
(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory
exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via
AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.
Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a
cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to
degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving
contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more
coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate
for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional
structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

Result: 在ADNI和ABIDE数据集上性能优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该框架能更精确刻画神经振荡的多频动态，提升脑疾病诊断的敏感性与特异性

Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders
and constructing brain functional connectivity networks
  by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els
largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations,
  treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial
fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within
  specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
  While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they
often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be
  optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations.
  To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade
Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each
  brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture
  both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional
  network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism
within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations
  for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE
  datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The

Result: 在七个公共基准上超越现有Transformer和MLP模型，显著提升长序列预测性能

Conclusion: AWEMixer通过时频联合建模有效解决非平稳信号预测难题，具有更强噪声鲁棒性与预测准确性

Abstract: Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant
challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor
signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality
when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to
operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by
Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the
temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive
Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a
Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by
Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a
Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent
frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through
cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency
localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate
that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models.
Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared
with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence
time series forecasting. Code is available at

Abstract: Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime,
and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models
struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically
prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a
modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder.
This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while
emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a
multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating
conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its
improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing
critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness
of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced
time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

Conclusion: 所提方法有效结合了黑箱偏好学习与灰箱物理信息，提升人机协同优化性能。

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop calibration is often addressed via preference-based
optimization, where algorithms learn from pairwise comparisons rather than
explicit cost evaluations. While effective, methods such as Preferential
Bayesian Optimization or Global optimization based on active preference
learning with radial basis functions (GLISp) treat the system as a black box
and ignore informative sensor measurements. In this work, we introduce a
sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates measurable
descriptors into the preference-learning loop through a physics-informed
hypothesis function and a least-squares regularization term. This injects
grey-box structure, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor
information while preserving the flexibility of preference-based search.
Numerical evaluations on an analytical benchmark and on a human-in-the-loop
vehicle suspension tuning task show faster convergence and superior final
solutions compared to baseline GLISp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺和分布偏移场景下，传统训练难以触发grokking，亟需有效方法实现模型泛化。

Method: 通过知识蒸馏（KD）从已泛化模型迁移到新分布，研究其在低数据量、联合分布和持续预训练下的效果。

Result: KD能在低于临界数据量时诱导并加速grokking，在联合分布和持续学习中显著提升泛化能力，仅用10%数据即可取得优异性能。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是低数据与动态分布环境下实现模型泛化的关键机制，为grokking的迁移机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where models
exhibit delayed generalization following overfitting on training data. We focus
on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the
critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios
involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD)
from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and
accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available
data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for
deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We
then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that
while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has
insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual
distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual
pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find
that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting,
achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our
results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge
transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in
low-data and evolving distribution settings.

Motivation: 随着深度学习模型规模扩大，稀疏计算与专用数据流硬件成为提升效率的关键，但现有编译器缺乏对稀疏操作全面融合的支持。

Method: FuseFlow 将 PyTorch 稀疏模型转化为融合后的稀疏数据流图，支持跨表达式融合、并行化、数据流排序和稀疏阻塞，并基于周期级仿真进行架构分析。

Result: 在四个真实稀疏应用场景中，FuseFlow 揭示了全融合并非总是最优，融合粒度依赖于模型结构；通过启发式方法剪枝次优配置，GPT-3 BigBird 注意力实现约2.7倍加速。

Conclusion: FuseFlow 为稀疏模型的编译优化提供了灵活、高效的解决方案，证明了融合策略需因模型而异，且可显著提升数据流硬件上的执行效率。

Abstract: As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow
hardware have emerged as powerful solutions to address efficiency. We propose
FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in
PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow
architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general
cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across
kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like
parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a
cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion
strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world
machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire
cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not
always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model
itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal
configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including
a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse
attention.

Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice
orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls
that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for
these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self
optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we
introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a
base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical
Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried
entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further
add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using
context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications,
our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and
improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

TL;DR: 提出CNODE模型，利用神经常微分方程建模帕金森病脑形态的连续变化，显著提升个体化进展预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖离散、规则采样的数据，难以处理帕金森病中不规则、稀疏的MRI数据，且无法有效捕捉个体在发病时间、进展速度和症状严重度上的异质性。

Method: 提出CNODE框架，通过神经常微分方程（Neural ODE）建模脑形态的连续时间变化，并联合学习个体初始时间和进展速度，将个体轨迹对齐至共享进展轨迹。

Result: 在PPMI数据集上，CNODE在预测帕金森病纵向进展方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CNODE为帕金森病的个体化数字孪生预测提供了连续、灵活且高效的建模新范式。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry
patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight,
treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However,
existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer
architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling
to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts.
Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity
including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity,
which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE
(Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD
progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain
changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition,
we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align
individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE
on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
forecasting longitudinal PD progression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表示学习在预测任务中成功，但在因果任务（如干预效应预测）中表现不佳，亟需融合因果推断以提升因果理解能力

Method: 构建统计与计算框架，整合观测与干预数据、多模态数据（单细胞、组织、生物体水平），用于因果变量发现与最优干预设计

Result: 未明确给出具体结果，提出框架方向以解决因果发现、多模态因果变量学习与干预优化问题

Conclusion: 多模态数据为表示学习与因果推断的融合提供了新机遇，应发展系统性方法以实现可解释的因果决策

Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of
complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning
has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning
latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring
any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely
successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including
predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage
between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity
in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data
(observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the
single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical
and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning
motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use
observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed
causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal
variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.

TL;DR: DuetServe通过动态SM分区在单GPU上实现预填充和解码阶段的隔离，提升吞吐量1.3倍并保持低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统要么共享GPU导致阶段干扰，要么分离部署造成资源浪费，亟需高效轻量的解决方案。

Method: 采用注意力感知的屋顶模型预测延迟，结合SM分区优化器与无中断执行引擎，按需动态隔离预填充与解码。

Result: 相比最先进框架，DuetServe在保持低延迟下最高提升1.3倍总吞吐量。

Conclusion: 细粒度自适应SM分区是实现高吞吐与低延迟平衡的有效途径。

Abstract: Modern LLM serving systems must sustain high throughput while meeting strict
latency SLOs across two distinct inference phases: compute-intensive prefill
and memory-bound decode phases. Existing approaches either (1) aggregate both
phases on shared GPUs, leading to interference between prefill and decode
phases, which degrades time-between-tokens (TBT); or (2) disaggregate the two
phases across GPUs, improving latency but wasting resources through duplicated
models and KV cache transfers. We present DuetServe, a unified LLM serving
framework that achieves disaggregation-level isolation within a single GPU.
DuetServe operates in aggregated mode by default and dynamically activates
SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing when TBT degradation is predicted. Its key
idea is to decouple prefill and decode execution only when needed through
fine-grained, adaptive SM partitioning that provides phase isolation only when
contention threatens latency service level objectives (SLOs). DuetServe
integrates (1) an attention-aware roofline model to forecast iteration latency,
(2) a partitioning optimizer that selects the optimal SM split to maximize
throughput under TBT constraints, and (3) an interruption-free execution engine
that eliminates CPU-GPU synchronization overhead. Evaluations show that
DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3x while maintaining low
generation latency compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集MLP和边样条网络缺乏几何局部性与理论保证，需更紧凑、可解释且理论扎实的替代方案。

Method: 使用学习的单纯形网格，结合Bernstein-Bezier多项式、可逆形变、形状正则化、半离散最优传输覆盖和可微边翻转，端到端训练。

Result: 在理论假设下达到经典FEM逼近率M^(-m/d)，在合成任务、表格数据和轻量CNN上性能媲美或超越MLP/KAN，提升校准性并降低推理延迟。

Conclusion: SiFEN是紧凑、可解释、理论完备的高效预测器，适合作为MLP的替代架构。

Abstract: We introduce Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a learned piecewise-polynomial
predictor that represents f: R^d -> R^k as a globally C^r finite-element field
on a learned simplicial mesh in an optionally warped input space. Each query
activates exactly one simplex and at most d+1 basis functions via barycentric
coordinates, yielding explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and
cache-friendly sparsity. SiFEN pairs degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with
a light invertible warp and trains end-to-end with shape regularization,
semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips. Under standard
shape-regularity and bi-Lipschitz warp assumptions, SiFEN achieves the classic
FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices. Empirically, on synthetic
approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and as a drop-in head
on compact CNNs, SiFEN matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameter
budgets, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency
due to geometric locality. These properties make SiFEN a compact,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and
edge-spline networks.

TL;DR: PuzzleMoE是一种无需训练的MoE压缩方法，通过稀疏专家合并和位打包编码，在压缩50%参数的同时保持精度并加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型因专家参数存储开销大而难以广泛应用，现有压缩方法在高压缩比下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出稀疏专家合并，使用双掩码识别共享与专家特有参数；引入位打包编码，复用指数位存储掩码和符号，避免额外存储开销。

Result: 在50%压缩比下，MMLU上比已有方法提升最多16.7%，推理速度提升1.28倍，且精度基本无损。

Conclusion: PuzzleMoE实现了高效、无损的MoE压缩，为大规模MoE模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling
language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per
input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high
memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as
the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have
explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from
performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce
PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high
accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE
performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy
and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and
expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary
masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses
underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up
to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it
outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50%
compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.

Conclusion: 自编码器的性能受限于流形的拓扑结构，但在特定动态系统中仍具备有效编码的潜力。

Abstract: Given a "data manifold" $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and "latent space"
$\mathbb{R}^\ell$, an autoencoder is a pair of continuous maps consisting of an
"encoder" $E\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ and "decoder" $D\colon
\mathbb{R}^\ell\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the "round trip" map $D\circ E$ is
as close as possible to the identity map $\mbox{id}_M$ on $M$. We present
various topological limitations and capabilites inherent to the search for an
autoencoder, and describe capabilities for autoencoding dynamical systems

Motivation: 体积假设无法解释大数据在泛化中的作用，需探究数据量对极小值体积与泛化能力的影响。

Method: 通过测量不同数据量下极小值的体积，分析损失景观随数据变化的特性。

Result: 发现泛化良好的尖峰极小值原本体积小难被找到，但增加数据后其体积相对增大，更易被优化算法发现。

Conclusion: 大数据通过重塑损失景观，扩大泛化良好极小值的体积，使其更易被优化算法收敛，从而提升泛化性能。

Abstract: The volume hypothesis suggests deep learning is effective because it is
likely to find flat minima due to their large volumes, and flat minima
generalize well. This picture does not explain the role of large datasets in
generalization. Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data
reveals sharp minima which generalize well exist, but are unlikely to be found
due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape, such
that previously small generalizing minima become (relatively) large.

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as promising molecules to combat
antimicrobial resistance. However, fragmented datasets, inconsistent
annotations, and the lack of standardized benchmarks hinder computational
approaches and slow down the discovery of new candidates. To address these
challenges, we present the Expanded Standardized Collection for Antimicrobial
Peptide Evaluation (ESCAPE), an experimental framework integrating over 80.000

peptides from negative sequences and incorporates their functional annotations
into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, capturing activities across
antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic classes. Building on
ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and
structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides.
Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average
Precision over the second-best method adapted for this task, establishing a new
state-of-the-art multilabel peptide classification. ESCAPE provides a
comprehensive and reproducible evaluation framework to advance AI-driven

Result: PRH在癫痫检测的网络分类任务中表现优于DPH，分类效果更优。

Conclusion: PRH是一种更高效且有效的有向图持久同调方法，适用于神经科学中的分类问题。

Abstract: We explore the recently introduced persistent reachability homology (PRH) of
digraph data, i.e. data in the form of directed graphs. In particular, we study
the effectiveness of PRH in network classification task in a key neuroscience
problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of
digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main
advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs
appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller
digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that
PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and
their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support
vector machine.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about
their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input
text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1)
fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free
guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that
combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even
degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical
incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined
effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually
simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in
training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through
concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and
can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate
its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent
improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of
input prompts.

Motivation: 标准GNN优化平均误差，忽视稀疏但关键的高活性化合物区域，现有过采样方法易破坏分子拓扑结构。

Method: SPECTRA在光谱域重建分子图，通过Fused Gromov-Wasserstein对齐节点，插值拉普拉斯特征值/向量与节点特征，并重构边生成物理解释性强的中间分子；结合核密度估计的稀有性预算机制聚焦稀疏区域。

Result: 在基准测试中，SPECTRA显著改善目标区域的预测误差，保持竞争力的总体MAE，并生成结构反映光谱几何的可解释合成分子。

Conclusion: 光谱几何感知的增强策略能有效高效解决分子属性回归中的数据不平衡问题。

Abstract: In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high
potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on
these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often
distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral
Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular
graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute
molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused)
Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates
Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis;
and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates
with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a
kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are
scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions,
SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy.
On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges
while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic
molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our
results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective
and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.

Result: 理论证明仅需$	ilde{O}(oot d oot)$次score评估即可收敛，为首个纯DDPM次线性界。

Conclusion: DDRaM在保持原采样结构下显著提升效率，并通过实验验证在预训练图像生成模型上的优越性能。

Abstract: SDE-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have shown remarkable success in real-world sample generation tasks. Prior
analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization,
showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or
initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and
Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized
midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to
better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework
called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys
favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions,
with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure
convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM
sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with
ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate
from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of
the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with
pre-trained image synthesis models.

Motivation: 以往研究显示供应链可追溯性影响食品消费，但运输因素的具体影响尚不明确，需进一步识别消费者在意的运输属性。

Method: 通过第二轮偏好实验，结合机器学习模型，评估五种创新运输证书（运输方式、物联网、安全措施、能源来源、必须送达日期）及产品和决策者因素对消费选择的影响。

Result: 消费者显著偏好安全和能源相关的运输证书，价格、产品类型和决策者因素也显著影响购买决策。

Conclusion: 研究为优化美国食品供应链系统提供了数据驱动的改进建议，强调安全与能源证书的重要性。

Abstract: This paper utilizes a machine learning model to estimate the consumer's
behavior for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the
U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with
supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation
factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices.
Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific
transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was
applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were
proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures,
Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also
incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes.
The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates
within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally,
the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and
decision-maker factors on purchasing choices. Ultimately, the study offers
data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems.

Motivation: LLM代理因预训练与测试环境不匹配，难以应对新型复杂环境，存在语法和语义双重误解问题。

Method: 1）在线分布适应：学习轻量适配向量修正输出分布；2）部署时动态建模：通过人格化探索学习环境因果动态，构建非参数世界模型。

Result: 在函数调用和网页导航等基准上均有效，尤其在WebArena上将成功率从2%提升至23%。

Conclusion: 动态建模对复杂环境尤为有效，为实现更通用的LLM代理提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and
complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to
a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions.
This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic
misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats,
and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only
revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and
complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging
environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online
distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by
learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output
distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format.
Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven
exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal
dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world
model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,
including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the
effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal
computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective
in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle,
demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based
agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases
the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

Motivation: 现有生成方法存在化学不合理输出、泛化差和计算成本高问题，亟需更可靠的深度学习对接模型。

Method: 提出碎片化方案，将配体分解为刚性片段，利用SE(3)黎曼扩散模型学习在结合口袋中重组这些片段。

Result: 在PoseBusters数据集上Top-1成功率超79.9%，显著优于现有深度学习方法（12.7%-30.8%），并首次超越经典物理方法。

Conclusion: SigmaDock实现了深度学习在分子对接中的重大突破，兼具高精度、强泛化和计算效率。

Abstract: Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular
docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise
faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,
but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor
generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from
structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building
on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion
model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within
the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock
exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex
diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show
SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates
(RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8%
reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent
generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning
approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test
split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of
deep learning for molecular modelling.

Motivation: 现有方法在多智能体协调中难以兼顾行为表达能力与实时推理效率，扩散模型慢但强，高斯策略快但弱

Result: 在12个环境34个数据集上，推理速度比扩散方法快14.5倍，与高斯策略方法速度相近但性能更优

Conclusion: MAC-Flow有效缓解了多智能体协调中性能与效率的权衡问题

Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for
multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination
are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present
in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However,
prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising
diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally
slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling
multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a
flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into
decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast
execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and
$34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and
computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$
faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining
good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of
prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续控制中全局最大化导致的不稳定性问题，同时减少量子资源消耗

Method: 结合指数族先验与量子玻尔兹曼分布，构建混合量子-经典模型，实现连续变量的解析梯度推导

Result: 可直接集成到Actor-Critic算法，提出基于CSQBM采样的连续Q学习框架

Conclusion: CSQBM在保持表达力的同时显著提升连续控制的稳定性与效率

Abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By
combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann
distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model
that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness.
Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed
analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms.
Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces
global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby
overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

Method: 通过引入虚拟控制输入增强流场，利用非线性控制理论提供形式化约束保障

Result: SAD-Flower在不重训练的情况下实现测试时满足未见过的约束，显著优于现有生成模型基线

Conclusion: 该框架为数据驱动规划提供了具有理论保证的安全轨迹生成新范式

Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning.
However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action
constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for
the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems.
Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which
potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by
proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and
Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of
the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be
derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal
guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency.
Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time
satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across
several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various
generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

Motivation: 传统预测模型因捐赠波动大、季节性和自然灾害导致的概念漂移而准确性不稳定，亟需更适应动态环境的预测方法。

Method: 提出FoodRL，一种基于强化学习的元学习框架，通过聚类和动态加权多种预测模型，结合近期表现与上下文信息进行自适应预测。

Result: 在东西海岸两家结构不同的食品银行多年数据上，FoodRL在常态及灾害期间均优于基线方法，可额外提供每年170万份餐食的分配能力。

Conclusion: FoodRL不仅提升了人道主义供应链的预测适应性，还展现出显著的社会Impact，为食品分配提供了高效、可靠的智能决策工具。

Abstract: Food banks are crucial for alleviating food insecurity, but their
effectiveness hinges on accurately forecasting highly volatile in-kind
donations to ensure equitable and efficient resource distribution. Traditional
forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to
unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and
natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in
the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and
dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and
contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally
distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by
wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by
hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly
during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and
adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent
to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant
potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for
humanitarian supply chains.

Conclusion: 该工作首次在在线RMDP中实现高效且最优的在线学习，为实际应用提供理论保障。

Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment
transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust
Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are
imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models
allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good
state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of
exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting
where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.
To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we
introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the
mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show
that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We
propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear
regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We
also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm
achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the
number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through comprehensive numerical experiments.

Conclusion: 自利的自动驾驶车辆可通过先进学习方法（如联邦学习）实现协同合作，无需显式系统目标。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the
near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and
human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can
be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating
system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the
benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to
all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand
whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed
autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective
rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral
economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when
pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of
CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed
human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained
among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a
simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic
agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives.
Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates
the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the
emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based
on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging
advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective
cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

Motivation: 现有无标签强化学习方法在大模型上有效，但在小模型上因推理能力不足而性能下降，亟需适应资源受限模型的鲁棒无监督方法。

Conclusion: 模型预存推理能力是无标签RL成功的关键，课程学习与数据难度控制是突破小模型瓶颈的有效路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of
unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning
capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of
these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning
capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and
reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals
critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's
pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below
baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate
sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective
self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in
determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet
effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to
progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority
rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline
to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates
consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities,
providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap
reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models. We make our code available

Conclusion: Craftax-MA和Craftax-Coop为多智能体强化学习提供了高效、复杂且可扩展的基准，有望推动未来长期研究的发展。

Abstract: Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging
benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing
benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately
stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in
many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present
\textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment,
Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general
abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is
exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment
interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling
challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension
introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require
complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating
that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark,
including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and
argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

Conclusion: 该工作为可 elicitable 属性的多校准提供了高效、普适的理论框架，标志着算法公平性与预测学习的重要突破。

Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that
demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on
themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups
of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between
multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and
property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if
it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property
value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over
the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient
algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a
hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property
$\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.
  In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property
$\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis
classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following
[GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when
given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$
$\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a
hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an
elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap
multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously
established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely
resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean
multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense.

Conclusion: DGL在保持决策对齐的同时，大幅降低计算开销，接近监督学习的效率。

Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization
problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has
motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how
the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream
decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art
methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific
surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer,
often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the
downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a
simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing
solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection
problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and
shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by
solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains
on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c)
as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard
supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that
DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity,
and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art
DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training
time. Code is available at https://github.com/paularodr/Dual-Guided-Learning.

Result: 所有现有遗忘方法在概率解码下均存在显著知识泄露，表明当前技术遗忘效果有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLM遗忘技术远未达标，需开发更鲁棒的遗忘方法以实现真正意义上的知识删除。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is critical for regulatory
compliance and for building ethical generative AI systems that avoid producing
private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content. Despite rapid progress, in
this work we show that \textit{almost all} existing unlearning methods fail to
achieve true forgetting in practice. Specifically, while evaluations of these
`unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest
successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the
literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models
are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this
vulnerability, we introduce \texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric
that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when
generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies.
Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the
first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly
defined \texttt{leak@$k$} metric. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge
leakage persists across methods and tasks, underscoring that current
state-of-the-art unlearning techniques provide only limited forgetting and
highlighting the urgent need for more robust approaches to LLM unlearning.

Abstract: This work investigates the structural properties, cycloid trajectories, and
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown mixing
weights and regression parameters. Recent studies have established global
convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence
in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the
theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with
its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive
explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and
regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural
properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the
trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by
establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high
SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The
trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM
estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle
between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our
analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on
statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating
EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence
with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a
novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.

Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as hybrid models combining CNN with LSTM,

Our research highlights the effectiveness of ML and DL models in predicting CVD
risk among diabetic patients, automating and enhancing clinical

Abstract: Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data
augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current
state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to
fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that
combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a
discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is
decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel
correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete
tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token
sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with
arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves
orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving
cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于不完全U统计量的可扩展ROC-SVM方法，显著降低计算成本并保持AUC性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ROC-SVM计算复杂度高（O(n^2)），限制了其在大规模数据中的应用

Method: 利用不完全U统计量降低计算复杂度，并通过低秩核近似实现非线性分类

Result: 理论证明了近似误差界，实验表明方法在保持AUC性能的同时大幅减少训练时间

Conclusion: 该方法为类不平衡问题提供高效且可扩展的ROC-SVM解决方案

Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the
conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance.
However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training
involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a
scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby
substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the
framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation,
enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical
analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation,
and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM
with drastically reduced training time.

Abstract: The financial industry faces a significant challenge modeling and risk
portfolios: balancing the predictability of advanced machine learning models,
neural network models, and explainability required by regulatory entities (such
as Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau). This paper intends to fill the gap in the application between these
"black box" models and explainability frameworks, such as LIME and SHAP.
Authors elaborate on the application of these frameworks on different models
and demonstrates the more complex models with better prediction powers could be
applied and reach the same level of the explainability, using SHAP and LIME.
Beyond the comparison and discussion of performances, this paper proposes a
novel five dimensional framework evaluating Inherent Interpretability, Global
Explanations, Local Explanations, Consistency, and Complexity to offer a
nuanced method for assessing and comparing model explainability beyond simple
accuracy metrics. This research demonstrates the feasibility of employing
sophisticated, high performing ML models in regulated financial environments by
utilizing modern explainability techniques and provides a structured approach
to evaluate the crucial trade offs between model performance and
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深层模型虽精度高但计算成本大，传统训练方式效率低，需探索更高效的渐进式扩展方法。

Method: 基于优化理论与特征学习，提出零层/一层渐进式深度扩展策略，优化新层初始化、超参数迁移、学习率调度与扩展时机。

Result: 在GPT-2上实现约80%的计算节省或5倍加速，损失几乎与60层70亿参数全模型相当。

Conclusion: 渐进式深度扩展是高效训练大模型的有效途径，零/一层策略在计算与性能间达到最优平衡。

Abstract: Model depth is a double-edged sword in deep learning: deeper models achieve
higher accuracy but require higher computational cost. To efficiently train
models at scale, an effective strategy is the progressive training, which
scales up model capacity during training, hence significantly reducing
computation with little to none performance degradation. In this work, we study
the depth expansion of large models through the lens of optimization theory and
feature learning, offering insights on the initialization of new layers,
hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion.
Specifically, we propose zero/one-layer progressive training for the optimal
tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, zero/one-layer progressive
training on GPT2 can save $\approx 80\%$ compute, or equivalently accelerate
$\approx 5\times$ while achieving almost the same loss, compared to to a fully
trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters.

Result: 在非自回归生成任务中达到SOTA性能，生成分子与原始肽结合物相似，并可实现肽模拟物设计。

Conclusion: Peptide2Mol是有效生成与优化生物活性小分子的深度生成模型，能显著提升基于蛋白口袋的药物设计能力。

Abstract: Structure-based drug design has seen significant advancements with the
integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the generation of
hit and lead compounds. However, most AI-driven approaches neglect the
importance of endogenous protein interactions with peptides, which may result
in suboptimal molecule designs. In this work, we present Peptide2Mol, an
E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model that generates small
molecules by referencing both the original peptide binders and their
surrounding protein pocket environments. Trained on large datasets and
leveraging sophisticated modeling techniques, Peptide2Mol not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive generative tasks, but also
produces molecules with similarity to the original peptide binder.
Additionally, the model allows for molecule optimization and peptidomimetic
design through a partial diffusion process. Our results highlight Peptide2Mol
as an effective deep generative model for generating and optimizing bioactive
small molecules from protein binding pockets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳价预测受政策突变和市场噪音影响大，现有方法将去噪与建模分离，且未系统评估先进深度学习架构，导致鲁棒性和泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合Bai-Perron、ICSS和PELT算法检测结构突变，采用小波变换去噪，并融合LSTM、GRU和TCN三种深度学习模型，构建单变量与多变量数据集进行对比评估。

Result: PELT-WT-TCN模型表现最优，相比基线模型（Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM）降低22.35% RMSE和18.63% MAE，相比原始LSTM降低70.55% RMSE和74.42% MAE。

Conclusion: 整合结构感知与多尺度分解的深度学习框架能显著提升非平稳金融时间序列预测的准确性与可解释性。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market
decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective
decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural
breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and
market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches,
have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and
modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced
deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization
capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid
framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and
PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep
learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot
prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and
policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate
datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing
forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by
70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without
decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value
of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep
learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price
forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer模型难以处理EHR中不规则就诊间隔和非结构化时序数据，亟需更有效的时序建模方法。

Method: 提出BiPETE，结合旋转位置编码（编码相对就诊时间）与正弦位置编码（保留就诊顺序），在两个精神健康队列中直接训练预测ASUD风险，并使用Integrated Gradients进行特征归因分析。

Result: 相比基线模型，AUPRC在抑郁和PTSD队列中分别提升34%和50%；消融实验证实双编码策略的有效性，识别出炎症、血液和代谢标志物及特定药物为关键风险/保护因子。

Conclusion: BiPETE提供了一种无需预训练、高性能且可解释的EHR疾病风险预测框架，有助于临床风险评估与干预决策。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk
prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal
dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack
of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder
or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional
embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to
preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is
trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and
substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving
the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the
depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms
the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the
Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key
clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal
inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific
medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified
by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk
assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In
summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease
risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OvA-LP是一种针对联邦微调中客户端分布异质性问题的最小化框架，通过冻结编码器和一对一头部设计从源头抑制漂移，显著提升非IID条件下的模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦微调方法在客户端数据分布高度异质时因局部更新偏移导致全局模型偏差和方差放大，且事后矫正方法在极端非IID条件下脆弱。

Method: OvA-LP结合冻结编码器的线性探测、一对一头部结构及两阶段流程，保持预训练特征几何结构并解耦logits，从源头抑制漂移。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上100客户端条件下，OvA-LP保持95.9%的IID准确率，远超PFPT（10.1%）和FFT-MoE（34.5%）；且对称与非对称标签噪声下仍具鲁棒性，计算开销与编码器规模解耦。

Conclusion: OvA-LP为异构环境下的联邦微调提供了原理清晰、高效鲁棒的新范式，首次在PEFT框架中实现漂移源头抑制。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data
but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local
drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and
amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and
personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle
under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework
that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at
its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing
on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure,
preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the
mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over
shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of
its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1%
(PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains
resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition,
precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of
encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a
principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.

Result: QuAnTS被验证为结构良好、内容全面，为TSQA研究奠定了基础，且人类表现提供了性能基准。

Conclusion: QuAnTS鼓励未来研究通过文本与时间序列模型交互，提升系统透明度与决策能力。

Abstract: Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular,
complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved
interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and
decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models
has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question
answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention.
To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA)
dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we
pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of
tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is
well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly
evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a
deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human
performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such
models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series
models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent
systems.

Result: 明确了不同激活函数对应的最佳损失函数，揭示了损失函数选择本质上是对输出分布的假设，并扩展至约束输出、重尾分布等实际场景。

Conclusion: 输出层设计应与损失函数协同考虑，本质上是通过GLMs建模概率分布，为深度学习模型设计提供统计依据。

Abstract: The loss function used to train a neural network is strongly connected to its
output layer from a statistical point of view. This technical report analyzes
common activation functions for a neural network output layer, like linear,
sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, detailing their mathematical properties and their
appropriate use cases. A strong statistical justification exists for the
selection of the suitable loss function for training a deep learning model.
This report connects common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE),
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and various Cross-Entropy losses to the statistical
principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Choosing a specific loss
function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for the
model output, highlighting the link between these functions and the Generalized
Linear Models (GLMs) that underlie network output layers. Additional scenarios
of practical interest are also considered, such as alternative output
encodings, constrained outputs, and distributions with heavy tails.

Result: 在高生产成本或模糊反馈场景下，显著提升优化精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合成本约束与感知模糊性建模，提升偏好优化的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization allows optimization of objectives that are
either expensive or difficult to measure directly, by relying on a minimal
number of comparative evaluations done by a human expert. Generating candidate
solutions for evaluation is also often expensive, but this cost is ignored by
existing methods. We generalize preference-based optimization to explicitly
account for production and evaluation costs with Consecutive Preferential
Bayesian Optimization, reducing production cost by constraining comparisons to
involve previously generated candidates. We also account for the perceptual
ambiguity of the oracle providing the feedback by incorporating a
Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model to
capture indifference to small utility differences. We adapt an
information-theoretic acquisition strategy to this setting, selecting new
configurations that are most informative about the unknown optimum under a
preference model accounting for the perceptual ambiguity. We empirically
demonstrate a notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs
or with indifference feedback.

Motivation: PRRT治疗转移性神经内分泌肿瘤效果个体差异大，亟需可靠预测模型以实现个性化治疗。

Method: 回顾性研究116例接受177Lu-DOTATOC的患者，构建七种模型（单模态实验室/SR-PET/CT及多模态融合），使用随机森林和三维CNN，并通过特征重要性与梯度图评估可解释性。

Result: 多模态融合模型（实验室+SR-PET+CT）表现最优，AUROC达0.72，显著优于单模态模型（最高0.59）。

Conclusion: 多模态深度学习模型可有效预测PRRT后PFS，具备临床应用潜力，未来经外部验证可支持风险分层随访策略。

Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for
metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs
only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could
support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory,
imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated
patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with
metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical
characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor
positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected.
Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including
unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches.
Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps.
Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1
year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline
chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT
cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only
on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal
three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed
worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion
model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch
- achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01).
Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers
outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external
validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.

Conclusion: 模型融合可在不显著损失领域知识的前提下，有效恢复并增强大模型的指令泛化能力，为生物声学应用提供新方案。

Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent
a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most
prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong
performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces
trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM
achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name
individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a
single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that
interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering
instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise.
Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot
generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new
state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.

Motivation: 现有投毒攻击要么导致生成数据整体退化，要么需要控制训练过程，难以在真实场景中应用，亟需更隐蔽、更实用的攻击方法。

Method: 提出关联投毒（associative poisoning）方法，仅扰动训练数据以改变生成输出中特定特征对的统计关联，理论上证明其可行性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 生成式模型易受隐蔽的统计操纵，现有防御手段不足，需提出新的对抗策略。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative models such as Stable Diffusion and
ChatGPT has made them increasingly attractive targets for malicious
exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Existing poisoning attacks
compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of
generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data
poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises
fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the
training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate
statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated
outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove
its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two
state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning
effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the
marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality
outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that
generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and
natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations
that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine
the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel
countermeasure strategy.

Conclusion: 应根据传感器部署密度和采样频率选择模型，Moirai等多变量TSFM是高效时空预测管道的理想选择，代码已开源以促进复现。

Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume
spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically
powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic
deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook
how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream
model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from
additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts.
This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different
forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a
systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural
networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs),
and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under
varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world
temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are
effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate,
leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for
limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies
but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced.
Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively
learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights
for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少神经网络训练中的高计算成本，特别是避免昂贵的反向传播过程。

Method: 采用基于控制变量的技术确保更新为真实梯度的无偏估计，并借鉴神经切线核理论设计梯度预测器。

Result: 在视觉Transformer分类任务上实证验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法可显著降低训练成本，同时保持梯度估计的准确性，为高效训练神经网络提供新思路。

Abstract: We propose a new way of training neural networks, with the goal of reducing
training cost. Our method uses approximate predicted gradients instead of the
full gradients that require an expensive backward pass. We derive a
control-variate-based technique that ensures our updates are unbiased estimates
of the true gradient. Moreover, we propose a novel way to derive a predictor
for the gradient inspired by the theory of the Neural Tangent Kernel. We
empirically show the efficacy of the technique on a vision transformer
classification task.

TL;DR: ActiTect 是一个开源机器学习工具，能自动从腕式活动记录仪数据中检测孤立性快速眼动睡眠行为障碍（iRBD），在多个队列中表现出高准确率（AUROC 0.84–0.95）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: iRBD 是 α-突触核蛋白病的前驱标志，但现有活动记录仪缺乏高效分析管道，限制了其在大规模筛查中的应用。

Method: 开发了 ActiTect，包含鲁棒预处理、自动睡眠-觉醒检测和可解释运动特征提取，基于78例患者训练模型，并在多个内外部队列中验证。

Result: 在内部测试集（AUROC=0.86）和两个外部独立队列（AUROC=0.84 和 0.94）中均表现优异，留一数据集交叉验证 AUROC 为 0.84–0.89，特征稳定可复现。

Conclusion: ActiTect 作为开源工具，具备高泛化性和鲁棒性，推动可穿戴设备在 iRBD 筛查中的标准化与广泛应用。

Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major
prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical
onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system
atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting
RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements,
they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This
study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool
to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across
heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing
and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract
physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns.
Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong
discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was
confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two
independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To
assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the
internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range
= 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive
features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled
multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By
being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and
facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby
advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model
using wearable devices.

<details>

Motivation: 传统扩散模型在因果反事实推理中存在信息丢失（SRE），无法满足古典因果理论对精确外生噪声推断的要求。

Method: 提出因果信息守恒（CIC）原则，设计可解析可逆的BELM-MDCM框架，结合目标建模与混合训练目标，消除SRE。

Result: 该框架在精度上达SOTA，并首次实现高保真个体级反事实推理。

Conclusion: 为现代生成模型与古典因果理论的结合奠定基础，确立新标准。

Abstract: Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for
counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of
latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex,
non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The
advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a
promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for
perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for
this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural
Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the
principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition
for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based
framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction
through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework,
a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid
Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity,
individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work
provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern
generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new
and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.

Motivation: 卡车-无人机协同系统在最后一公里物流中能提升效率并降低环境影响，但TSP-D问题具有NP-hard组合复杂性，传统优化方法难以应对。

Method: 采用Transformer编码器（引入优化的k近邻稀疏注意力与全局节点特征）和最小门控单元解码器，构建异步优势Actor-Critic框架。

Result: 在N=10到100的基准实例上，所提方法在更短计算时间内获得竞争甚至更优解，训练时间显著减少且最终性能更佳。

Conclusion: 该框架在求解TSP-D问题上兼具高性能与高训练效率，为物流协同优化提供了有效的新范式。

Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has
positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal
extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle
coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced
environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond
the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning
offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent
challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive
decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep
reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The
architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder
and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel,
optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for
focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration
of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded
representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire
framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.
Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales
(N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior
solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance
heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover,
compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed
framework significantly reduces the total training time required while
achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in
training efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is important for the
safe and effective implementation of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects.
This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation
for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with
machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$
injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that
uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the
diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve
covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation
(ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability
fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is
applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced
Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains
significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied,
while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical
implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty
quantification for risk assessment.

Motivation: 在保障强隐私的同时维持高预测性能，针对电子健康记录的时间序列预测模型面临成员推理攻击风险

Method: 采用零阶优化（ZOO）、PCA约束的ZOO（ZOO-PCA）和MixUp三种数据增强方法，使用合成数据重新训练模型

Result: ZOO-PCA显著降低攻击者的真阳性率与假阳性率之比，且不损害模型测试性能

Conclusion: 数据增强是提升TSF模型抗成员推理攻击的有效手段，ZOO-PCA在隐私保护与模型精度间实现最优平衡

Abstract: Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is
critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health
Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate
Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with
synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by
reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key
challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original
training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to
enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple
augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO
constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to
strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental
results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA
attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.

TL;DR: CAT通过稠密注意力与压缩机制，在不牺牲性能的前提下实现高效长序列处理，支持单模型自适应权衡质量与计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效注意力方法因预设结构限制导致质量-效率权衡僵化，难以适应不同下游任务需求，且架构复杂。

Method: CAT采用稠密注意力结合序列压缩，将长上下文分块压缩后进行注意力计算，支持多块大小联合训练，实现测试时自适应调整。

Result: 单个CAT模型在语言建模、上下文召回和长上下文理解任务中超越现有高效基线，性能接近稠密Transformer，推理速度快1.4-3倍，内存降低2-9倍。

Conclusion: CAT通过简洁设计实现高效与高性能的统一，为长序列建模提供灵活、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of
efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions
and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions
in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically
in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute
tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications
require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency
and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that
artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent
state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at
specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design
process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &
Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two
simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of
tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression
results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and
memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for
efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,
unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without
any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive
evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and
long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing
efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different
compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in
language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring
2-9x lower total memory usage.

Result: 在运动鞋、手袋和收藏卡三个电商数据集上，六种先进视觉模型均显示单模态和多模态检索精度一致提升

Conclusion: 视觉渲染产品元数据是一种简单而有效的零样本多模态检索增强方法

Abstract: Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on
effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance
and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are
vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded
in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that
reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content
(e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform
vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and
boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on
three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading
cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval
accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that
visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for
zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

Conclusion: 所提方法实现了从输入输出数据中高效、准确地学习物理一致动力学，拓展了哈密顿GP在真实场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws,
in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent
models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work
incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to
obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical
principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is
rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with
non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem
setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme
for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP
hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping
coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take
advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for
computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is
evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a
state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map
desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure,
naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse

Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational
challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly
critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure
reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new
fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual
learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together
with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in
class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid
conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay
(ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based
feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay
memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with
only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone
prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable,
real-world fault prediction in smart grids.

Result: APP加速59.63%-93.27%，所得电路与原始路径修补结果高度重叠且性能相近。

Conclusion: APP在保持电路有效性的同时大幅降低计算成本，为小模型的机制可解释性提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability
pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally
expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In
this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach
leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically
reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP
pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign
higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher
performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although
Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing
pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by
Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint
required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the
search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%.
Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads,
leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to
the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP
provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar
performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a
setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under
model uncertainty and adversarial corruption. We propose a clustered multitask
approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient
aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how
clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior
affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR
tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret
decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this
reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within
each cluster.

Conclusion: 该方法使图网络模拟器适用于逆设计和闭环控制任务，材料参数可作为设计变量。

Abstract: Graph network-based simulators (GNS) have demonstrated strong potential for
learning particle-based physics (such as fluids, deformable solids, and
granular flows) while generalizing to unseen geometries due to their inherent
inductive biases. However, existing models are typically trained for a single
material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors,
limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular
flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning
mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify
that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early
message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of
constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information
propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the
first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test
performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this
insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)
conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This
approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or
moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and
0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short
simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data
reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method. Finally, we
validate the model's utility by applying it to an inverse problem, successfully
identifying unknown cohesion parameters from trajectory data. This approach
enables the use of GNS in inverse design and closed-loop control tasks where
material properties are treated as design variables.

Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant
advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex
characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range
dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting,
their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data
sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across
different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this
complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a
compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In
this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit
specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how
we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time
series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and
forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration
strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration
framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of
TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative,
context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by
adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models.
Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other
popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating
Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of clustering-based
approaches for self-supervised and unsupervised learning. However, the
application of clustering is often heuristic, and the optimal methodology
remains unclear. In this work, we establish connections between these
unsupervised clustering methods and classical mixture models from statistics.
Through this framework, we demonstrate significant enhancements to these
clustering methods, leading to the development of a novel model named SiamMM.
Our method attains state-of-the-art performance across various self-supervised
learning benchmarks. Inspection of the learned clusters reveals a strong
resemblance to unseen ground truth labels, uncovering potential instances of
mislabeling.

TL;DR: TUPANN是一款仅依赖卫星数据的可转移、物理对齐的短时降水预测模型，在多种气候条件下表现优异，尤其在强降雨阈值下提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统短时降水预报依赖密集雷达网络，难以覆盖气候极端地区，亟需一种无需雷达、全球适用的卫星驱动预报方法。

Method: TUPANN将预报分解为三部分：变分编码解码器推断运动与强度场，MaxViT在时间维度演化潜在状态，可微分平流算子重建未来帧，训练基于GOES-16 RRQPE数据。

Result: 在GOES-16和IMERG数据上，TUPANN在四个不同气候区（里约、亚马孙、迈阿密、拉巴斯）的10–180分钟预报中，CSI和HSS指标表现最优或第二优，强降雨区域提升显著，跨城市训练增强泛化性。

Conclusion: 物理对齐的深度学习方法可实现高精度、可迁移、接近实时的全球卫星降水短临预报。

Abstract: Accurate short-term precipitation forecasts predominantly rely on dense
weather-radar networks, limiting operational value in places most exposed to
climate extremes. We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned
Nowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike
most deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into
physically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion
and intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a
lead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable
advection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both
GOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,
Manaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics
over 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and
hybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in
most settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple
cities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest
degradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model
produces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical
flow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16. These
results indicate that physically aligned learning can provide nowcasts that are
skillful, transferable and global.

TL;DR: 本文推导了流匹配分布近似的KL散度的确定性非渐近上界，并证明其在TV距离下具有近似最小最优的统计效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在建立流匹配方法的统计收敛理论，并与扩散模型在TV距离下的效率进行比较。

Method: 通过绑定L2流匹配损失与KL散度之间的关系，推导出包含常数A1和A2的上界，并分析其统计收敛速率。

Result: KL散度上界为A1*ε + A2*ε²，流匹配在TV距离下达到近似最小最优效率，与扩散模型相当。

Conclusion: 流匹配方法在统计效率上可与扩散模型媲美，理论得到数值实验支持。

Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular,
if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL
divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is
bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$
depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently,
this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers
under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves
nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our
results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of
diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and
learned velocities corroborate our theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无线土壤传感系统因土壤质地（如Al和C）变化需反复校准，限制了实际应用，亟需一种无需校准的多组分同步测量方案。

Method: 提出SoilX系统，结合对比跨组分学习（3CL）与正交正则化、分离损失函数，消除组分间干扰；并设计四面体天线阵列与天线切换机制，实现与设备部署无关的介电常数稳定测量。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模土壤质地组分C和Al，SoilX实现了真正意义上的校准-free多参数同步传感，为精准农业提供了高效、鲁棒的实时监测解决方案。

Abstract: Precision agriculture demands continuous and accurate monitoring of soil
moisture (M) and key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
and potassium (K), to optimize yields and conserve resources. Wireless soil
sensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current
solutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to
handle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and
organic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce
SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key
components: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX
eliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates
Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the
Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle
cross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral
antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure
soil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5%
over baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法独立处理序列和结构信息，未能捕获局部几何与全局序列模式间的复杂耦合。

Method: 提出DGTN，通过双向扩散机制协同优化GNN结构嵌入与Transformer注意力，实现结构-序列的联合学习。

Conclusion: DGTN为异构蛋白表征的集成提供了理论严谨的扩散学习框架，并证明其收敛性与优效性。

Abstract: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme thermodynamic
stability (DDG) is fundamental to protein engineering and drug design. While
recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence
and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate
coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We
present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that
co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and
transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a
bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings
guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2)
transformer representations refine GNN message passing through
attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis
showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds
than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves
state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with
6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion
mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis
proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling,
with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work
establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein
representations through learnable diffusion.
