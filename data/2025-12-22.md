TL;DR: V-Agent是一个基于视觉语言模型的多智能体视频搜索系统，通过融合视觉与语音内容实现上下文感知的视频检索，零样本性能达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本检索系统在多模态场景中表现有限，难以有效理解视频中的视觉与语音信息。

Method: 微调视觉语言模型（VLM）并结合图像-文本检索模型的检索向量，将视频帧和ASR语音转录嵌入共享多模态空间，由路由、搜索、对话三个智能体协同工作。

Result: 在MultiVENT 2.0基准上实现零样本SOTA性能，显著提升视频检索质量。

Conclusion: V-Agent为多模态视频搜索提供了高效、可交互的解决方案，兼具学术价值与实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We introduce V-Agent, a novel multi-agent platform designed for advanced video search and interactive user-system conversations. By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality. Our proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, highlighting its potential for both academic research and real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用CNN和VGG-16模型检测色情网页图像，CNN在8次实验中以94.87%准确率表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印尼政府封锁大量包含色情内容的网站，但用户可通过VPN绕过，亟需快速准确识别色情内容。

Method: 采用深度学习方法，比较CNN与VGG-16模型在检测色情图像上的性能。

Result: CNN模型在epoch=50、学习率=0.001时准确率达94.87%，优于VGG-16。

Conclusion: CNN模型在快速准确检测色情内容方面比VGG-16更有效。

Abstract: In 2020, a total of 59,741 websites were blocked by the Indonesian government due to containing negative content, including pornography, with 14,266 websites falling into this category. However, these blocked websites could still be accessed by the public using virtual private networks (VPNs). This prompted the research idea to quickly identify pornographic content. This study aims to develop a system capable of identifying websites suspected of containing pornographic image content, using a deep learning approach with convolutional neural network (CNN) and visual geometry group 16 (VGG-16) model. The two models were then explored comprehensively and holistically to determine which model was most effective in detecting pornographic content quickly. Based on the findings of the comparison between testing the CNN and VGG-16 models, research results showed that the best test results were obtained in the eighth experiment using the CNN model at an epoch value level of 50 and a learning rate of 0.001 of 0.9487 or 94.87%. This can be interpreted that the CNN model is more effective in detecting pornographic content quickly and accurately compared to using the VGG-16 model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVM通过冻结主编码器并引入独立调制路径，实现对神经响应的条件自适应建模，在多个实验设置中超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型难以区分稳定的视觉编码与条件特异性适应，限制了其在不同刺激和个体间的泛化能力。

Method: AVM采用冻结的Vision Transformer编码器保留稳定视觉特征，同时通过独立训练的调制路径响应刺激内容和个体身份带来的神经响应变化。

Result: 在两个小鼠V1数据集上，AVM比SOTA模型V1T预测相关性提升约2%，跨数据集适应中FEVE提升9.1%，具备高解释性与架构效率。

Conclusion: AVM为生物和实验条件下的神经建模提供了统一、可扩展的框架，对神经科学与类脑AI系统设计具有启示意义。

Abstract: While deep learning models have shown strong performance in simulating neural responses, they often fail to clearly separate stable visual encoding from condition-specific adaptation, which limits their ability to generalize across stimuli and individuals. We introduce the Adaptive Visual Model (AVM), a structure-preserving framework that enables condition-aware adaptation through modular subnetworks, without modifying the core representation. AVM keeps a Vision Transformer-based encoder frozen to capture consistent visual features, while independently trained modulation paths account for neural response variations driven by stimulus content and subject identity. We evaluate AVM in three experimental settings, including stimulus-level variation, cross-subject generalization, and cross-dataset adaptation, all of which involve structured changes in inputs and individuals. Across two large-scale mouse V1 datasets, AVM outperforms the state-of-the-art V1T model by approximately 2% in predictive correlation, demonstrating robust generalization, interpretable condition-wise modulation, and high architectural efficiency. Specifically, AVM achieves a 9.1% improvement in explained variance (FEVE) under the cross-dataset adaptation setting. These results suggest that AVM provides a unified framework for adaptive neural modeling across biological and experimental conditions, offering a scalable solution under structural constraints. Its design may inform future approaches to cortical modeling in both neuroscience and biologically inspired AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出一种将Finer-CAM解释与TLS投影中的结构特征关联的方法，揭示了树木分类模型主要依赖冠层特征，部分物种依赖树干和细枝特征，分类准确性达96%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在树种分类中精度高但决策过程不透明，需系统理解模型依赖的结构特征以提升可信度。

Method: 结合Finer-CAM与TLS投影段，使用YOLOv8模型对2445棵树进行五折交叉验证，分析630张显著性图。

Result: 模型平均准确率96%，主要依赖冠层特征；欧洲白蜡、苏格兰松和道格拉斯冷杉更依赖树干和细枝；模型判断的相似物种与人类专家一致。

Conclusion: 需深入理解模型决策机制，以识别数据与模型偏差，增强分类结果的可信度。

Abstract: Classifying tree species has been a core research area in forest remote sensing for decades. New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of the decision processes of tree species classification models to help reveal data set and model limitations, biases, and to build confidence in model predictions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种类电影制作的多阶段视频生成方法，通过剧本引导视觉锚定，显著提升角色一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频模型难以生成长且连贯的视频故事，尤其在角色一致性上表现不佳

Method: 首先用大语言模型生成详细剧本，再用文本到图像模型创建角色视觉锚点，最后逐场景生成视频

Result: 移除视觉锚定机制导致角色一致性分数从7.99暴跌至0.55，证实视觉先验对身份保留至关重要；同时发现印度与西方主题生成存在文化偏差

Conclusion: 多阶段分解与视觉锚定是实现高一致性长视频生成的关键，且需关注模型的文化偏见问题

Abstract: Generating long, cohesive video stories with consistent characters is a significant challenge for current text-to-video AI. We introduce a method that approaches video generation in a filmmaker-like manner. Instead of creating a video in one step, our proposed pipeline first uses a large language model to generate a detailed production script. This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations.

TL;DR: InfoTok是一种基于信息论的自适应视频分词框架，可在不损失性能的情况下减少20%的token，实现2.3倍压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频分词器采用固定压缩率，无法应对视频信息密度的差异，导致冗余或信息丢失。

Method: 提出基于Shannon信息理论的ELBO优化算法，构建Transformer自适应压缩器，按信息丰富度动态分配token。

Result: 在保持性能前提下节省20% token，压缩率提升2.3倍，超越现有启发式自适应方法。

Conclusion: InfoTok实现了更高效且准确的视频表征，为未来视频处理提供理论与方法新方向。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient discrete video tokenization is essential for long video sequences processing. Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜视频标注成本高，现有方法在有限标注数据下性能受限，需有效利用未标注数据提升分割精度。

Method: 采用双网络交叉监督、不确定性引导伪标签、联合伪标签监督、特征与图像级互学习，并引入时空信息校正网络优化分割结果。

Conclusion: Endo-SemiS 有效利用未标注数据，通过多策略协同提升半监督分割性能，具有临床实用价值，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Endo-SemiS, a semi-supervised segmentation framework for providing reliable segmentation of endoscopic video frames with limited annotation. EndoSemiS uses 4 strategies to improve performance by effectively utilizing all available data, particularly unlabeled data: (1) Cross-supervision between two individual networks that supervise each other; (2) Uncertainty-guided pseudo-labels from unlabeled data, which are generated by selecting high-confidence regions to improve their quality; (3) Joint pseudolabel supervision, which aggregates reliable pixels from the pseudo-labels of both networks to provide accurate supervision for unlabeled data; and (4) Mutual learning, where both networks learn from each other at the feature and image levels, reducing variance and guiding them toward a consistent solution. Additionally, a separate corrective network that utilizes spatiotemporal information from endoscopy video to improve segmentation performance. Endo-SemiS is evaluated on two clinical applications: kidney stone laser lithotomy from ureteroscopy and polyp screening from colonoscopy. Compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods, Endo-SemiS substantially achieves superior results on both datasets with limited labeled data.

TL;DR: 提出LongShOTBench基准和LongShOTAgent系统，用于评估和提升多模态长视频理解能力，现有模型表现普遍较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多侧重时间长度或模态丰富性之一，且评估指标单一，无法揭示模型失败模式，亟需更全面、可解释的评测体系。

Method: 构建LongShOTBench基准，包含开放问答、多轮对话与工具使用任务，结合人工验证与评分标准；并提出LongShOTAgent，通过预处理、搜索与迭代优化处理长视频。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Flash得52.95%，开源模型低于30%，LongShOTAgent达44.66%，揭示当前模型在长视频理解上的显著差距。

Conclusion: LongShOTBench为多模态长视频理解提供了可复现、可解释的评估基础，推动模型向真实场景能力发展。

Abstract: Long-form multimodal video understanding requires integrating vision, speech, and ambient audio with coherent long-range reasoning. Existing benchmarks emphasize either temporal length or multimodal richness, but rarely both and while some incorporate open-ended questions and advanced metrics, they mostly rely on single-score accuracy, obscuring failure modes. We introduce LongShOTBench, a diagnostic benchmark with open-ended, intent-driven questions; single- and multi-turn dialogues; and tasks requiring multimodal reasoning and agentic tool use across video, audio, and speech. Each item includes a reference answer and graded rubric for interpretable, and traceable evaluation. LongShOTBench is produced via a scalable, human-validated pipeline to ensure coverage and reproducibility. All samples in our LongShOTBench are human-verified and corrected. Furthermore, we present LongShOTAgent, an agentic system that analyzes long videos via preprocessing, search, and iterative refinement. On LongShOTBench, state-of-the-art MLLMs show large gaps: Gemini-2.5-Flash achieves 52.95%, open-source models remain below 30%, and LongShOTAgent attains 44.66%. These results underscore the difficulty of real-world long-form video understanding. LongShOTBench provides a practical, reproducible foundation for evaluating and improving MLLMs. All resources are available on GitHub: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/longshot.

TL;DR: 提出4D-RGPT模型、P4D训练框架和R4D-Bench基准，提升多模态大模型对4D动态场景的感知与推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大模型在3D结构和时序动态推理上能力有限，且现有3D/4D视频问答基准缺乏区域级提示和动态场景覆盖

Method: 设计4D-RGPT模型捕获视频4D表征，提出Perceptual 4D Distillation（P4D）从专家模型迁移4D知识，构建R4D-Bench基准含深度感知与区域提示

Result: 4D-RGPT在现有4D VQA基准和新提出的R4D-Bench上均取得显著性能提升

Conclusion: 该工作有效增强了多模态模型对时空动态场景的感知与推理能力，为未来4D视觉理解提供了新框架与基准

Abstract: Despite advances in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their ability to reason over 3D structures and temporal dynamics remains limited, constrained by weak 4D perception and temporal understanding. Existing 3D and 4D Video Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks also emphasize static scenes and lack region-level prompting. We tackle these issues by introducing: (a) 4D-RGPT, a specialized MLLM designed to capture 4D representations from video inputs with enhanced temporal perception; (b) Perceptual 4D Distillation (P4D), a training framework that transfers 4D representations from a frozen expert model into 4D-RGPT for comprehensive 4D perception; and (c) R4D-Bench, a benchmark for depth-aware dynamic scenes with region-level prompting, built via a hybrid automated and human-verified pipeline. Our 4D-RGPT achieves notable improvements on both existing 4D VQA benchmarks and the proposed R4D-Bench benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出FORMSpoT-$Δ$，基于SPOT卫星数据实现法国全国林冠高度与年度扰动的1.5米分辨率监测，显著提升小尺度森林扰动检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲森林碳汇能力下降，现有卫星扰动产品分辨率不足（>100 m²），无法检测单树尺度变化。

Method: 利用SPOT-6/7时序数据，结合PVTv2变压器模型与机载激光雷达数据，生成1.5米分辨率林冠高度图；并通过共配准与时空总变差去噪实现年度扰动检测。

Result: 在19个ALS验证点和5087个国家森林调查样地验证下，FORMSpoT-$Δ$在山地森林F1分数达0.44，较现有产品提升一个数量级。

Conclusion: FORMSpoT-$Δ$首次实现国家尺度树级森林动态监测，可用于评估管理行为、早期识别森林衰退与量化隐性碳损失，强调维持高分辨率卫星任务的重要性。

Abstract: The recent decline of the European forest carbon sink highlights the need for spatially explicit and frequently updated forest monitoring tools. Yet, existing satellite-based disturbance products remain too coarse to detect changes at the scale of individual trees, typically below 100 m$^{2}$. Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$Δ$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$Δ$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging. These results underscore the critical importance of sustaining very high-resolution satellite missions like SPOT and open-data initiatives such as DINAMIS for monitoring forests under climate change.

Conclusion: InfCam实现了无深度依赖的高保真相机控制视频生成，为后期制作提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in video diffusion models has spurred growing interest in camera-controlled novel-view video generation for dynamic scenes, aiming to provide creators with cinematic camera control capabilities in post-production. A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

Conclusion: IUS是首个面向CDS系统的可解释合成图像评估指标，通用性强，已开源。

Abstract: Synthetic medical image data can unlock the potential of deep learning (DL)-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems through the creation of large scale, privacy-preserving, training sets. Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: "How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance. The generality of IUS for synthetic data assessment is demonstrated also for greyscale X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities. IUS implementation is available at https://github.com/innoisys/ius

Conclusion: DGH是一种可扩展、数据驱动的替代方案，突破了物理模拟的局限，为高保真数字人头发建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: The creation of photorealistic dynamic hair remains a major challenge in digital human modeling because of the complex motions, occlusions, and light scattering. Existing methods often resort to static capture and physics-based models that do not scale as they require manual parameter fine-tuning to handle the diversity of hairstyles and motions, and heavy computation to obtain high-quality appearance. In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation. DGH achieves promising geometry and appearance results, providing a scalable, data-driven alternative to physics-based simulation and rendering.

Abstract: Maritime autonomous systems require robust predictive capabilities to anticipate vessel motion and environmental dynamics. While transformer architectures have revolutionized AIS-based trajectory prediction and demonstrated feasibility for sonar frame forecasting, their application to maritime radar frame prediction remains unexplored, creating a critical gap given radar's all-weather reliability for navigation. This survey systematically reviews predictive modeling approaches relevant to maritime radar, with emphasis on transformer architectures for spatiotemporal sequence forecasting, where existing representative methods are analyzed according to data type, architecture, and prediction horizon. Our review shows that, while the literature has demonstrated transformer-based frame prediction for sonar sensing, no prior work addresses transformer-based maritime radar frame prediction, thereby defining a clear research gap and motivating a concrete research direction for future work in this area.

Motivation: 当前深度学习重建方法通常针对特定协议设计，限制了其泛化能力和部署灵活性。

Method: 提出SDUM框架，结合Restormer重建器、学习型线圈敏感图估计器、采样感知加权数据一致性、协议元数据条件编码及渐进式级联扩展训练。

Result: SDUM在CMRxRecon2025全部四个赛道上超越专用基线最高达1.0 dB，在CMRxRecon2024和fastMRI上分别优于PromptMR+和PC-RNN；性能随参数量对数增长，相关性达0.986。

Conclusion: SDUM实现了MRI重建的通用性与可扩展性，为临床部署提供实用路径。

Abstract: Clinical MRI encompasses diverse imaging protocols--spanning anatomical targets (cardiac, brain, knee), contrasts (T1, T2, mapping), sampling patterns (Cartesian, radial, spiral, kt-space), and acceleration factors--yet current deep learning reconstructions are typically protocol-specific, hindering generalization and deployment. We introduce Scalable Deep Unrolled Model (SDUM), a universal framework combining a Restormer-based reconstructor, a learned coil sensitivity map estimator (CSME), sampling-aware weighted data consistency (SWDC), universal conditioning (UC) on cascade index and protocol metadata, and progressive cascade expansion training. SDUM exhibits foundation-model-like scaling behavior: reconstruction quality follows PSNR ${\sim}$ log(parameters) with correlation $r{=}0.986$ ($R^2{=}0.973$) up to 18 cascades, demonstrating predictable performance gains with model depth. A single SDUM trained on heterogeneous data achieves state-of-the-art results across all four CMRxRecon2025 challenge tracks--multi-center, multi-disease, 5T, and pediatric--without task-specific fine-tuning, surpassing specialized baselines by up to ${+}1.0$~dB. On CMRxRecon2024, SDUM outperforms the winning method PromptMR+ by ${+}0.55$~dB; on fastMRI brain, it exceeds PC-RNN by ${+}1.8$~dB. Ablations validate each component: SWDC ${+}0.43$~dB over standard DC, per-cascade CSME ${+}0.51$~dB, UC ${+}0.38$~dB. These results establish SDUM as a practical path toward universal, scalable MRI reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该方法无需配对数据即可实现身份保留的专业人像生成，为个人照片提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Photographs of people taken by professional photographers typically present the person in beautiful lighting, with an interesting pose, and flattering quality. This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning. Our approach yields high-quality, reposed portraits and achieves strong qualitative and quantitative performance on real-world imagery.

Abstract: We present a framework for document-centric background generation with multi-page editing and thematic continuity. To ensure text regions remain readable, we employ a \emph{latent masking} formulation that softly attenuates updates in the diffusion space, inspired by smooth barrier functions in physics and numerical optimization. In addition, we introduce \emph{Automated Readability Optimization (ARO)}, which automatically places semi-transparent, rounded backing shapes behind text regions. ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations. This design reflects how humans build continuity by retaining prior context, ensuring that visual motifs evolve coherently across an entire document. Our method further treats a document as a structured composition in which text, figures, and backgrounds are preserved or regenerated as separate layers, allowing targeted background editing without compromising readability. Finally, user-provided prompts allow stylistic adjustments in color and texture, balancing automated consistency with flexible customization. Our training-free framework produces visually coherent, text-preserving, and thematically aligned documents, bridging generative modeling with natural design workflows.

Abstract: Fine-grained fire prediction plays a crucial role in emergency response. Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction. Validation underscores the importance of physical priors and cross-task collaboration, providing new insights for applying physics-informed world models to disaster prediction.

Conclusion: LGCLIP开创了一种无需人工标注图文对的新型分类范式，为轻量级视觉语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot image classification tasks. However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification.

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提升属性-对象绑定性能，超越需训练的方法

Conclusion: ABE-CLIP无需训练即可有效增强CLIP的细粒度语义绑定能力，为组合推理提供新思路

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.

Abstract: Quantifying and assessing urban greenery is consequential for planning and development, reflecting the everlasting importance of green spaces for multiple climate and well-being dimensions of cities. Evaluation can be broadly grouped into objective (e.g., measuring the amount of greenery) and subjective (e.g., polling the perception of people) approaches, which may differ -- what people see and feel about how green a place is might not match the measurements of the actual amount of vegetation. In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most. This location influence suggests that cultural, environmental, and experiential factors substantially shape how individuals observe greenery in cities.

Abstract: Mobile devices equipped with a multi-camera system and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are widely used nowadays, such as self-driving cars. The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) show immense promise in clinical applicability. However, their reliability is hindered by hallucinations, where models often fail to derive answers from visual evidence, instead relying on learned textual priors. Existing mitigation strategies for MedVLMs have distinct limitations: training-based methods rely on costly expert annotations, limiting scalability, while training-free interventions like contrastive decoding, though data-efficient, apply a global, untargeted correction whose effects in complex real-world clinical settings can be unreliable. To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance. Our module leverages an anatomical mask to direct a three-tiered contrastive decoding process. By dynamically re-weighting at the token, attention, and logits levels, it verifiably steers the model's focus onto specified regions, reinforcing anatomical understanding and suppressing factually incorrect outputs. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including chest X-ray, CT, brain MRI, and ocular ultrasound, demonstrate our method's effectiveness in improving regional understanding, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing overall diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: Fose有效平衡了性能与效率，为实时高分辨率多光谱图像融合提供了新方案。

Abstract: Pansharpening is a significant image fusion task that fuses low-resolution multispectral images (LRMSI) and high-resolution panchromatic images (PAN) to obtain high-resolution multispectral images (HRMSI). The development of the diffusion models (DM) and the end-to-end models (E2E model) has greatly improved the frontier of pansharping. DM takes the multi-step diffusion to obtain an accurate estimation of the residual between LRMSI and HRMSI. However, the multi-step process takes large computational power and is time-consuming. As for E2E models, their performance is still limited by the lack of prior and simple structure. In this paper, we propose a novel four-stage training strategy to obtain a lightweight network Fose, which fuses one-step DM and an E2E model. We perform one-step distillation on an enhanced SOTA DM for pansharping to compress the inference process from 50 steps to only 1 step. Then we fuse the E2E model with one-step DM with lightweight ensemble blocks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed Fose on three commonly used benchmarks. Moreover, we achieve a 7.42 speedup ratio compared to the baseline DM while achieving much better performance. The code and model are released at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/Fose.

Conclusion: Reasoning Palette通过潜在空间建模推理策略，有效提升大模型的探索能力与推理质量

Abstract: Exploration capacity shapes both inference-time performance and reinforcement learning (RL) training for large (vision-) language models, as stochastic sampling often yields redundant reasoning paths with little high-level diversity. This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enables interpretable and controllable control over the (vision-) language model's strategic behavior, thereby achieving consistent performance gains over standard RL methods.

Conclusion: CheXPO-v2通过过程监督有效抑制幻觉，实现高效、安全的医学VLM对齐，开源代码推动领域发展。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations, compromising clinical reliability. While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to "overthink" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured "Disease, Relation, Anatomy" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

Abstract: While Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across multi-modal tasks, their choice of vision encoders presents a fundamental weakness: their low-level features lack the robust structural and spatial information essential for document understanding and web agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce DAVE, a vision encoder purpose-built for VLMs and tailored for these tasks. Our training pipeline is designed to leverage abundant unlabeled data to bypass the need for costly large-scale annotations for document and web images. We begin with a self-supervised pretraining stage on unlabeled images, followed by a supervised autoregressive pretraining stage, where the model learns tasks like parsing and localization from limited, high-quality data. Within the supervised stage, we adopt two strategies to improve our encoder's alignment with both general visual knowledge and diverse document and web agentic tasks: (i) We introduce a novel model-merging scheme, combining encoders trained with different text decoders to ensure broad compatibility with different web agentic architectures. (ii) We use ensemble training to fuse features from pretrained generalist encoders (e.g., SigLIP2) with our own document and web-specific representations. Extensive experiments on classic document tasks, VQAs, web localization, and agent-based benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing DAVE as a strong vision encoder for document and web applications.

Conclusion: AOM实现了对任意光学传感器数据的通用建模，为遥感基础模型提供了更强的适应性与实用性。

Abstract: Optical satellites, with their diverse band layouts and ground sampling distances, supply indispensable evidence for tasks ranging from ecosystem surveillance to emergency response. However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings.

Abstract: Recent learning-based visual localization methods use global descriptors to disambiguate visually similar places, but existing approaches often derive these descriptors from geometric cues alone (e.g., covisibility graphs), limiting their discriminative power and reducing robustness in the presence of noisy geometric constraints. We propose an aggregator module that learns global descriptors consistent with both geometrical structure and visual similarity, ensuring that images are close in descriptor space only when they are visually similar and spatially connected. This corrects erroneous associations caused by unreliable overlap scores. Using a batch-mining strategy based solely on the overlap scores and a modified contrastive loss, our method trains without manual place labels and generalizes across diverse environments. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show substantial localization gains in large-scale environments while preserving computational and memory efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出一种课程学习框架，通过分离抽象推理与视觉感知策略，解决多模态大模型在长链视觉推理中的视觉遗忘问题。

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长链推理中出现“视觉遗忘”，因训练中过早融合抽象推理与视觉感知，导致推理能力弱和感知时机缺失。

Method: 1) 设计文本优先的监督微调课程，构建抽象推理骨干；2) 引入感知 grounded 的思维链（PG-CoT）连接视觉；3) 用强化学习建模感知时机，通过认知不确定性词（如“wait”）设计关键感知奖励。

Conclusion: 分离推理与感知技能是提升多模态模型复杂推理能力的关键，所提两阶段框架为未来设计提供新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential but remain brittle in complex, long-chain visual reasoning tasks. A critical failure mode is "visual forgetting", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as "think longer, see less". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning "how-to-think") and (2) strategic visual perception ("when-to-look"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., "wait", "verify"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \textbf{Code}: \url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频问答时，要么丢失关键信息，要么计算开销过大，而实际回答问题仅需少量关键信息。

Method: 引入问题感知的内存压缩机制，迭代处理视频子片段，用特殊记忆标记压缩信息，并递归聚合历史记忆以更新上下文。

Result: 在32K上下文限制下成功处理100K令牌（3600帧）的视频，仅需2分钟和37GB显存，性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: VideoDetective有效提升MLLMs对长视频的关键线索捕捉能力，同时大幅降低资源消耗，新数据集GLVC为评估提供新基准。

Abstract: Long Video Question-Answering (LVQA) presents a significant challenge for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to immense context and overloaded information, which could also lead to prohibitive memory consumption. While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage. Evaluation results across multiple long video benchmarks illustrate our method can more effectively seek critical clues from massive information.

Conclusion: Mitty证明了直接从人类观察视频学习机器人行为的可行性，摆脱了对中间表示和标注数据的依赖，推动了机器人学习的规模化发展。

Abstract: Learning directly from human demonstration videos is a key milestone toward scalable and generalizable robot learning. Yet existing methods rely on intermediate representations such as keypoints or trajectories, introducing information loss and cumulative errors that harm temporal and visual consistency. We present Mitty, a Diffusion Transformer that enables video In-Context Learning for end-to-end Human2Robot video generation. Built on a pretrained video diffusion model, Mitty leverages strong visual-temporal priors to translate human demonstrations into robot-execution videos without action labels or intermediate abstractions. Demonstration videos are compressed into condition tokens and fused with robot denoising tokens through bidirectional attention during diffusion. To mitigate paired-data scarcity, we also develop an automatic synthesis pipeline that produces high-quality human-robot pairs from large egocentric datasets. Experiments on Human2Robot and EPIC-Kitchens show that Mitty delivers state-of-the-art results, strong generalization to unseen environments, and new insights for scalable robot learning from human observations.

Conclusion: RadarGen为跨传感模态的统一生成仿真提供了可扩展的解决方案，兼容现有视觉数据集和仿真框架。

Abstract: We present RadarGen, a diffusion model for synthesizing realistic automotive radar point clouds from multi-view camera imagery. RadarGen adapts efficient image-latent diffusion to the radar domain by representing radar measurements in bird's-eye-view form that encodes spatial structure together with radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler attributes. A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation. Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, marking a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities.

Conclusion: AnyCXR为胸部X光分析提供了可扩展、可靠的解剖感知基础，显著降低标注负担并提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robust anatomical segmentation of chest X-rays (CXRs) remains challenging due to the scarcity of comprehensive annotations and the substantial variability of real-world acquisition conditions. We propose AnyCXR, a unified framework that enables generalizable multi-organ segmentation across arbitrary CXR projection angles using only synthetic supervision. The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance. These results demonstrate that AnyCXR establishes a scalable and reliable foundation for anatomy-aware CXR analysis and offers a practical pathway toward reducing annotation burdens while improving robustness across diverse imaging conditions.

Abstract: Understanding and generating multi-person interactions is a fundamental challenge with broad implications for robotics and social computing. While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated. Project page: https://von31.github.io/MAGNet/

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation plays a vital role in assisting clinical diagnosis and early tumor screening. However, challenges such as speckle noise, imaging artifacts, irregular lesion morphology, and blurred boundaries severely hinder accurate segmentation. To address these challenges, this work aims to design a robust and efficient model capable of automatically segmenting breast tumors in BUS images.We propose a novel segmentation network named WDFFU-Mamba, which integrates wavelet-guided enhancement and dual-attention feature fusion within a U-shaped Mamba architecture. A Wavelet-denoised High-Frequency-guided Feature (WHF) module is employed to enhance low-level representations through noise-suppressed high-frequency cues. A Dual Attention Feature Fusion (DAFF) module is also introduced to effectively merge skip-connected and semantic features, improving contextual consistency.Extensive experiments on two public BUS datasets demonstrate that WDFFU-Mamba achieves superior segmentation accuracy, significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of Dice coefficient and 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95).The combination of wavelet-domain enhancement and attention-based fusion greatly improves both the accuracy and robustness of BUS image segmentation, while maintaining computational efficiency.The proposed WDFFU-Mamba model not only delivers strong segmentation performance but also exhibits desirable generalization ability across datasets, making it a promising solution for real-world clinical applications in breast tumor ultrasound analysis.

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Current ultrasound AI remains fragmented into single-task tools, limiting clinical utility compared to versatile modern ultrasound systems.
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of single general-purpose deep learning models for multi-organ classification and segmentation.
  DESIGN: The Universal UltraSound Image Challenge 2025 (UUSIC25) involved developing algorithms on 11,644 images (public/private). Evaluation used an independent, multi-center test set of 2,479 images, including data from a center completely unseen during training to assess generalization.
  OUTCOMES: Diagnostic performance (Dice Similarity Coefficient [DSC]; Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve [AUC]) and computational efficiency (inference time, GPU memory).
  RESULTS: Of 15 valid algorithms, the top model (SMART) achieved a macro-averaged DSC of 0.854 across 5 segmentation tasks and AUC of 0.766 for binary classification. Models showed high capability in segmentation (e.g., fetal head DSC: 0.942) but variability in complex tasks subject to domain shift. Notably, in breast cancer molecular subtyping, the top model's performance dropped from AUC 0.571 (internal) to 0.508 (unseen external center), highlighting generalization challenges.
  CONCLUSIONS: General-purpose AI models achieve high accuracy and efficiency across multiple tasks using a single architecture. However, performance degradation on unseen data suggests domain generalization is critical for future clinical deployment.

Result: 在通用和特定退化任务中均取得最优性能，验证了视觉-语言先验对图像恢复的关键作用。

Conclusion: 整合VLM的视觉与语言先验能显著提升图像恢复的细节真实性和语义一致性。

Abstract: Many image restoration (IR) tasks require both pixel-level fidelity and high-level semantic understanding to recover realistic photos with fine-grained details. However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.

Conclusion: HiSIR-Net有效解决高分辨率PCBA微缺陷检测难题，提出的数据集与方法具有实用价值，代码与数据将公开。

Abstract: Automated defect inspection of assembled Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBA) is quite challenging due to the insufficient labeled data, micro-defects with just a few pixels in visually-complex and high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we present HiSIR-Net, a High resolution, Self-supervised Reconstruction framework for pixel-wise PCBA localization. Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate. To bridge the gap in high-resolution PCBA datasets, we further contribute a self-collected dataset named SIPCBA-500 of 500 images. We conduct extensive experiments on our SIPCBA-500 as well as public benchmarks, demonstrating the superior localization performance of our method while running at practical speed. Full code and dataset will be made available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: ProCache通过动态缓存策略有效平衡了加速与质量，为DiT实时部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their high computational cost hinders real-time deployment. While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.

Conclusion: 通过联合优化潜在空间与空间对应关系，可有效解决PBR纹理生成中的分布偏移与跨视角不一致问题。

Abstract: We propose a generative framework for producing high-quality PBR textures on a given 3D mesh. As large-scale PBR texture datasets are scarce, our approach focuses on effectively leveraging the embedding space and diffusion priors of pretrained latent image generative models while learning a material latent space, MatLat, through targeted fine-tuning. Unlike prior methods that freeze the embedding network and thus lead to distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels and hinder subsequent diffusion training, we fine-tune the pretrained VAE so that new material channels can be incorporated with minimal latent distribution deviation. We further show that correspondence-aware attention alone is insufficient for cross-view consistency unless the latent-to-image mapping preserves locality. To enforce this locality, we introduce a regularization in the VAE fine-tuning that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns the corresponding image regions to maintain strong pixel-latent spatial correspondence. Ablation studies and comparison with previous baselines demonstrate that our framework improves PBR texture fidelity and that each component is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: EMAG通过动态生成高质量负样本，显著提升生成模型的细节修复能力与输出质量，为引导机制提供了新范式。

Abstract: In diffusion and flow-matching generative models, guidance techniques are widely used to improve sample quality and consistency. Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG. We further demonstrate that EMAG naturally composes with advanced guidance techniques, such as APG and CADS, further improving HPS.

Abstract: Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities on complex visual tasks by thinking with images in their Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which is achieved by actively invoking tools to analyze visual inputs rather than merely perceiving them. However, existing models often struggle to reflect on and correct themselves when attempting incorrect reasoning trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern. The basic idea is to impose judgment on reasoning trajectories and penalize those that produce incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRIM achieves superior performance on visual understanding benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CodeDance使用可执行代码进行视觉推理，超越传统文本或固定模式方法，实现灵活、可解释且可迁移的多工具协同推理，并在多个基准上超越GPT-4o等先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源视觉推理方法依赖文本链、僵化视觉模式或单步流程，缺乏灵活性、可解释性和迁移能力。

Method: CodeDance通过生成、组合与执行代码来协调多种工具，计算中间结果并渲染视觉工件（如框、线、图表），实现透明自检推理；引入自适应工具调用奖励机制，平衡探索与效率。

Result: 在视觉搜索、数学、图表QA等基准上显著优于文本-only和模式驱动基线，甚至超越GPT-4o和更大开源模型；训练中涌现出未显式训练的工具调用、组合与跨任务迁移能力。

Conclusion: 可执行代码作为视觉推理的通用求解器，具备泛化性与可扩展性，为开放视觉推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent releases such as o3 highlight human-like "thinking with images" reasoning that combines structured tool use with stepwise verification, yet most open-source approaches still rely on text-only chains, rigid visual schemas, or single-step pipelines, limiting flexibility, interpretability, and transferability on complex tasks. We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning. Extensive experiments across reasoning benchmarks (e.g., visual search, math, chart QA) show that CodeDance not only consistently outperforms schema-driven and text-only baselines, but also surpasses advanced closed models such as GPT-4o and larger open-source models.

TL;DR: 提出ADK框架，通过离线生成描述性知识增强VLM的文本表示，在不增加推理开销的情况下显著提升少样本适应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法依赖固定提示，难以捕捉类别语义；图像诱导提示虽有效但推理开销大。

Method: ADK框架：1) 用LLM离线生成类别描述提示；2) 作为组合知识（平均表示）和实例特定知识（轻量注意力动态选择）引入。

Result: 在多种PEFT基线上一致提升性能，达到新SOTA，且为无参即插即用模块。

Conclusion: ADK有效补充提示语义，高效提升VLM少样本适应能力，无需牺牲推理效率。

Abstract: Despite the impressive zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they often struggle in downstream tasks with distribution shifts from the pre-training data. Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios.

Conclusion: RSHR-Bench为遥感视觉理解提供了更真实、可靠的评估基准，凸显当前模型在高分辨率视觉推理上的不足。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong perception and reasoning performance on existing remote sensing (RS) benchmarks. However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios. Code: https://github.com/Yunkaidang/RSHR

<details>

Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法评估过于简单，缺乏对隐式引用、视觉相似概念及社会偏见的全面测试。

Method: 提出EMMA基准，涵盖12项指标，评估五种方法在对象、名人、艺术风格、NSFW和版权五个领域的概念擦除能力。

Result: 现有方法在间接提示和视觉相似概念上易失效，部分方法加剧性别与种族偏见。

Conclusion: 概念擦除技术仍不成熟，需在社会公平与鲁棒性上进一步改进。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of text-to-image (T2I) generation has raised concerns about privacy, bias, and copyright violations. Concept erasure techniques offer a promising solution by selectively removing undesired concepts from pre-trained models without requiring full retraining. However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright). Our results show that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts (i.e., generating the erased concept when it is indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts (i.e., failing to generate non-targeted concepts resembling the erased one), while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.

Abstract: Purpose: To provide a diverse, high-quality dataset of color fundus images (CFIs) with detailed artery-vein (A/V) segmentation annotations, supporting the development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for vascular analysis in ophthalmology.
  Methods: CFIs were sampled from the longitudinal Rotterdam Study (RS), encompassing a wide range of ages, devices, and capture conditions. Images were annotated using a custom interface that allowed graders to label arteries, veins, and unknown vessels on separate layers, starting from an initial vessel segmentation mask. Connectivity was explicitly verified and corrected using connected component visualization tools.
  Results: The dataset includes 1024x1024-pixel PNG images in three modalities: original RGB fundus images, contrast-enhanced versions, and RGB-encoded A/V masks. Image quality varied widely, including challenging samples typically excluded by automated quality assessment systems, but judged to contain valuable vascular information.
  Conclusion: This dataset offers a rich and heterogeneous source of CFIs with high-quality segmentations. It supports robust benchmarking and training of machine learning models under real-world variability in image quality and acquisition settings.
  Translational Relevance: By including connectivity-validated A/V masks and diverse image conditions, this dataset enables the development of clinically applicable, generalizable machine learning tools for retinal vascular analysis, potentially improving automated screening and diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases.

TL;DR: 提出DESSERT框架，利用扩散模型和事件数据预测视频帧，显著提升动态场景下的帧合成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频帧预测在动态场景中因信息不足导致预测误差，事件相机虽提供高时间分辨率运动信息，但基于光流的像素变形方法易产生空洞和模糊。

Method: 提出DESSERT框架，结合预训练Stable Diffusion模型，通过事件-残差对齐VAE和事件条件扩散模型训练残差，引入DLT时序增强提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在多项对比实验中，DESSERT在帧清晰度和时间一致性上超越现有事件驱动和图像驱动的帧预测与插值方法。

Conclusion: 事件数据与扩散模型结合残差训练可有效提升动态视频帧预测质量，为高精度视频重建提供新范式。

Abstract: Video frame prediction extrapolates future frames from previous frames, but suffers from prediction errors in dynamic scenes due to the lack of information about the next frame. Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.

Method: 引入Polysome工具生成合成指令，基于公开HISTAI数据集构建HISTAI-Instruct（2.4万切片，110万指令-响应对），用其训练ANTONI-α视觉问答模型

Result: ANTONI-α在组织识别、肿瘤检测和鉴别诊断等WSI级VQA任务上超越MedGemma，且通过不同数据量的对比验证了性能提升

Conclusion: 公开的Polysome、HISTAI-Instruct和ANTONI-α为病理视觉语言模型提供了可复现、可扩展的解决方案，推动了该领域透明化与通用化发展

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have the potential to become co-pilots for pathologists. However, most VLMs either focus on small regions of interest within whole-slide images, provide only static slide-level outputs, or rely on data that is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility. Furthermore, training data containing WSIs paired with detailed clinical reports is scarce, restricting progress toward transparent and generalisable VLMs. We address these limitations with three main contributions. First, we introduce Polysome, a standardised tool for synthetic instruction generation. Second, we apply Polysome to the public HISTAI dataset, generating HISTAI-Instruct, a large whole-slide instruction tuning dataset spanning 24,259 slides and over 1.1 million instruction-response pairs. Finally, we use HISTAI-Instruct to train ANTONI-α, a VLM capable of visual-question answering (VQA). We show that ANTONI-α outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks of tissue identification, neoplasm detection, and differential diagnosis. We also compare the performance of multiple incarnations of ANTONI-α trained with different amounts of data. All methods, data, and code are publicly available.

Motivation: 传统显式变形方法难以准确迁移运动或恢复缺失区域，而基于注意力的方法复杂度高且几何约束弱。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 基于3D光流的显式变形进行粗对齐；2) 利用多参考图的跨注意力修正遮挡区域；3) 基于置信图的空间自适应融合。

Result: 在基准数据集上达到SOTA性能，有效提升视觉一致性与几何准确性。

Conclusion: SynergyWarpNet通过协同显式与注意力机制，实现了高效且高保真的神经肖像动画。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural portrait animation have demonstrated remarked potential for applications in virtual avatars, telepresence, and digital content creation. However, traditional explicit warping approaches often struggle with accurate motion transfer or recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based warping methods, though effective, frequently suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow. Next, a reference-augmented correction module leverages cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to semantically complete occluded or distorted regions. Finally, a confidence-guided fusion module integrates the warped outputs with spatially-adaptive fusing, using a learned confidence map to balance structural alignment and visual consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MDDN通过扩大采样范围和增强畸变感知能力，实现了更精确的全向图像超分辨率，为AR/VR应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As augmented reality and virtual reality applications gain popularity, image processing for OmniDirectional Images (ODIs) has attracted increasing attention. OmniDirectional Image Super-Resolution (ODISR) is a promising technique for enhancing the visual quality of ODIs. Before performing super-resolution, ODIs are typically projected from a spherical surface onto a plane using EquiRectangular Projection (ERP). This projection introduces latitude-dependent geometric distortion in ERP images: distortion is minimal near the equator but becomes severe toward the poles, where image content is stretched across a wider area. However, existing ODISR methods have limited sampling ranges and feature extraction capabilities, which hinder their ability to capture distorted patterns over large areas. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-level Distortion-aware Deformable Network (MDDN) for ODISR, designed to expand the sampling range and receptive field. Specifically, the feature extractor in MDDN comprises three parallel branches: a deformable attention mechanism (serving as the dilation=1 path) and two dilated deformable convolutions with dilation rates of 2 and 3. This architecture expands the sampling range to include more distorted patterns across wider areas, generating dense and comprehensive features that effectively capture geometric distortions in ERP images. The representations extracted from these deformable feature extractors are adaptively fused in a multi-level feature fusion module. Furthermore, to reduce computational cost, a low-rank decomposition strategy is applied to dilated deformable convolutions. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that MDDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and superiority in ODISR.

Conclusion: 破坏语义捷径是实现泛化检测的关键，该方法有效促使检测器关注更基础的高频生成痕迹

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative technologies necessitates reliable methods for detecting AI-generated images. A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process. Through comprehensive experiments on GAN and diffusion-based generators, we show that our approach significantly boosts the cross-generator performance of state-of-the-art detectors. Extensive analysis further verifies our hypothesis that the disruption of semantic cues is the key to generalization.

Conclusion: AIF模型在情感化视觉生成方面具有重要价值与广阔应用潜力

Abstract: Social media platforms enable users to express emotions by posting text with accompanying images. In this paper, we propose the Affective Image Filter (AIF) task, which aims to reflect visually-abstract emotions from text into visually-concrete images, thereby creating emotionally compelling results. We first introduce the AIF dataset and the formulation of the AIF models. Then, we present AIF-B as an initial attempt based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive user study experiments demonstrate that AIF models are significantly more effective at evoking specific emotions. Based on the presented results, we comprehensively discuss the value and potential of AIF models.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce RadImageNet-VQA, a large-scale dataset designed to advance radiologic visual question answering (VQA) on CT and MRI exams. Existing medical VQA datasets are limited in scale, dominated by X-ray imaging or biomedical illustrations, and often prone to text-based shortcuts. RadImageNet-VQA is built from expert-curated annotations and provides 750K images paired with 7.5M question-answer samples. It covers three key tasks - abnormality detection, anatomy recognition, and pathology identification - spanning eight anatomical regions and 97 pathology categories, and supports open-ended, closed-ended, and multiple-choice questions. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models still struggle with fine-grained pathology identification, particularly in open-ended settings and even after fine-tuning. Text-only analysis further reveals that model performance collapses to near-random without image inputs, confirming that RadImageNet-VQA is free from linguistic shortcuts.

Conclusion: 该方法可推广至其他AI辅助诊断场景，推动临床落地

Abstract: Deep neural networks are starting to show their worth in critical applications such as assisted cancer diagnosis. However, for their outputs to get accepted in practice, the results they provide should be explainable in a way easily understood by pathologists. A well-known and widely used explanation technique is occlusion, which, however, can take a long time to compute, thus slowing the development and interaction with pathologists. In this work, we set out to find a faster replacement for occlusion in a successful system for detecting prostate cancer. Since there is no established framework for comparing the performance of various explanation methods, we first identified suitable comparison criteria and selected corresponding metrics. Based on the results, we were able to choose a different explanation method, which cut the previously required explanation time at least by a factor of 10, without any negative impact on the quality of outputs. This speedup enables rapid iteration in model development and debugging and brings us closer to adopting AI-assisted prostate cancer detection in clinical settings. We propose that our approach to finding the replacement for occlusion can be used to evaluate candidate methods in other related applications.

Conclusion: AIFloodSense显著提升了洪水检测数据的全球多样性与任务多样性，为通用AI模型训练提供了关键资源。

Abstract: Accurate flood detection from visual data is a critical step toward improving disaster response and risk assessment, yet datasets for flood segmentation remain scarce due to the challenges of collecting and annotating large-scale imagery. Existing resources are often limited in geographic scope and annotation detail, hindering the development of robust, generalized computer vision methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIFloodSense, a comprehensive, publicly available aerial imagery dataset comprising 470 high-resolution images from 230 distinct flood events across 64 countries and six continents. Unlike prior benchmarks, AIFloodSense ensures global diversity and temporal relevance (2022-2024), supporting three complementary tasks: (i) Image Classification with novel sub-tasks for environment type, camera angle, and continent recognition; (ii) Semantic Segmentation providing precise pixel-level masks for flood, sky, and buildings; and (iii) Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enable natural language reasoning for disaster assessment. We establish baseline benchmarks for all tasks using state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating the dataset's complexity and its value in advancing domain-generalized AI tools for climate resilience.

TL;DR: 开源了专为智能家居场景优化的视觉语言模型MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B及其量化版本，显著提升居家任务理解与多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在智能家居场景下表现不足，需兼顾专用性与通用性，同时提升推理效率与数据利用率。

Method: 基于MiMo-VL-7B，采用两阶段训练：监督微调结合基于Group Relative Policy Optimization的强化学习，引入思维链监督与token预算感知推理。

Result: 在手势识别、Video-MME、MMMU-Pro等 benchmarks 上超越主流开源与闭源模型，居家任务表现领先，文本推理能力亦有提升。

Conclusion: 针对性的家居训练可显著增强多模态理解，兼顾通用推理，且开源模型与工具包推动真实场景应用。

Abstract: We open-source \textbf{MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B} and its quantized variant \textbf{MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B-GGUF}, a pair of home-centric vision-language models that achieve strong performance on both home-scenario understanding and general multimodal reasoning. Built on the MiMo-VL-7B backbone, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B is specialized for smart-home environments, attaining leading F1 scores on gesture recognition and common home-scenario understanding, while also delivering consistent gains across video benchmarks such as Video-MME, Video-MMMU, and Charades-STA, as well as language understanding benchmarks including MMMU-Pro and MMLU-Pro. In our experiments, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B outperforms strong closed-source and open-source baselines on home-scenario understanding and several multimodal reasoning benchmarks. To balance specialization and generality, we design a two-stage training pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization, leveraging efficient multi-domain data. We further incorporate chain-of-thought supervision and token-budget-aware reasoning, enabling the model to learn knowledge in a data-efficient manner while also performing reasoning efficiently. Our analysis shows that targeted home-scenario training not only enhances activity and gesture understanding, but also improves text-only reasoning with only modest trade-offs on document-centric tasks. Model checkpoints, quantized GGUF weights, and our home-scenario evaluation toolkit are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/XiaoMi/xiaomi-mimo-vl-miloco}{https://github.com/XiaoMi/xiaomi-mimo-vl-miloco} to support research and deployment in real-world smart-home applications.

TL;DR: LangDriveCTRL是一个通过自然语言控制编辑现实驾驶视频的框架，支持对象和行为的细粒度修改，显著提升指令对齐与视频真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶视频编辑方法难以根据自然语言指令实现精确、真实的多对象行为编辑，缺乏结构化场景表示与协同代理机制。

Method: 采用显式3D场景分解为场景图，结合由调度器协调的专用代理（对象 grounding、行为编辑、行为审核）实现语言到轨迹的转换，并用视频扩散模型优化渲染结果。

Result: 指令对齐性能提升近2倍，同时在结构保持、图像真实感和交通真实性方面超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: LangDriveCTRL实现了自然语言驱动的高保真驾驶视频编辑，为自动驾驶仿真和交通场景生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: LangDriveCTRL is a natural-language-controllable framework for editing real-world driving videos to synthesize diverse traffic scenarios. It leverages explicit 3D scene decomposition to represent driving videos as a scene graph, containing static background and dynamic objects. To enable fine-grained editing and realism, it incorporates an agentic pipeline in which an Orchestrator transforms user instructions into execution graphs that coordinate specialized agents and tools. Specifically, an Object Grounding Agent establishes correspondence between free-form text descriptions and target object nodes in the scene graph; a Behavior Editing Agent generates multi-object trajectories from language instructions; and a Behavior Reviewer Agent iteratively reviews and refines the generated trajectories. The edited scene graph is rendered and then refined using a video diffusion tool to address artifacts introduced by object insertion and significant view changes. LangDriveCTRL supports both object node editing (removal, insertion and replacement) and multi-object behavior editing from a single natural-language instruction. Quantitatively, it achieves nearly $2\times$ higher instruction alignment than the previous SoTA, with superior structural preservation, photorealism, and traffic realism.

TL;DR: 提出一个名为MULTIAQUA的多模态海洋数据集，用于提升恶劣天气和夜间条件下的场景理解，并展示仅用白天图像训练鲁棒深度网络的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人水面艇在复杂光照和天气条件下难以仅靠彩色图像进行准确感知，需融合多模态数据提升环境理解能力。

Method: 构建包含RGB、热成像、红外、LiDAR等同步校准标注数据的MULTIAQUA数据集，并提出仅使用白天数据训练的多模态深度网络方法。

Result: 在夜间困难测试集上验证了多模态方法的优越性能，证明仅用白天数据即可训练出在黑暗环境中表现可靠的模型。

Conclusion: MULTIAQUA数据集为海洋环境下多模态感知提供了新基准，显著简化了数据采集与训练流程，提升了模型在低能见度条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unmanned surface vehicles can encounter a number of varied visual circumstances during operation, some of which can be very difficult to interpret. While most cases can be solved only using color camera images, some weather and lighting conditions require additional information. To expand the available maritime data, we present a novel multimodal maritime dataset MULTIAQUA (Multimodal Aquatic Dataset). Our dataset contains synchronized, calibrated and annotated data captured by sensors of different modalities, such as RGB, thermal, IR, LIDAR, etc. The dataset is aimed at developing supervised methods that can extract useful information from these modalities in order to provide a high quality of scene interpretation regardless of potentially poor visibility conditions. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed dataset, we evaluate several multimodal methods on our difficult nighttime test set. We present training approaches that enable multimodal methods to be trained in a more robust way, thus enabling them to retain reliable performance even in near-complete darkness. Our approach allows for training a robust deep neural network only using daytime images, thus significantly simplifying data acquisition, annotation, and the training process.

TL;DR: 3D-RE-GEN通过组合式生成框架，从单张图像重建可修改的3D纹理场景，显著提升视觉效果与游戏开发中的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景重建方法在物体分解、空间关系和背景缺失上无法满足艺术家需求。

Method: 整合资产检测、重建与放置模型，结合生成式图像编辑与4-DoF可微优化，恢复相机参数并约束物体与地面平面对齐。

Result: 在单图3D场景重建中达到SOTA性能，生成连贯、可修改的场景，包含完整背景与合理光照。

Conclusion: 3D-RE-GEN通过 compositional 生成与空间优化，实现了艺术家可用的高质量3D场景重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene generation produce visually appealing output, but current representations hinder artists' workflows that require modifiable 3D textured mesh scenes for visual effects and game development. Despite significant advances, current textured mesh scene reconstruction methods are far from artist ready, suffering from incorrect object decomposition, inaccurate spatial relationships, and missing backgrounds. We present 3D-RE-GEN, a compositional framework that reconstructs a single image into textured 3D objects and a background. We show that combining state of the art models from specific domains achieves state of the art scene reconstruction performance, addressing artists' requirements.
  Our reconstruction pipeline integrates models for asset detection, reconstruction, and placement, pushing certain models beyond their originally intended domains. Obtaining occluded objects is treated as an image editing task with generative models to infer and reconstruct with scene level reasoning under consistent lighting and geometry. Unlike current methods, 3D-RE-GEN generates a comprehensive background that spatially constrains objects during optimization and provides a foundation for realistic lighting and simulation tasks in visual effects and games. To obtain physically realistic layouts, we employ a novel 4-DoF differentiable optimization that aligns reconstructed objects with the estimated ground plane. 3D-RE-GEN~achieves state of the art performance in single image 3D scene reconstruction, producing coherent, modifiable scenes through compositional generation guided by precise camera recovery and spatial optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖中心化数据，引发隐私问题并限制跨机构泛化能力。

Method: 采用混合ViT-UNet架构，结合卷积编码器与视觉变换器瓶颈，各机构基于私有数据微调全局模型生成数字孪生。

Result: 在9个异构MRI数据集（包括BraTS 2019-2021）上达到最高0.90的Dice分数，敏感性和特异性超90%，表现优于中心化模型。

Conclusion: TwinSegNet在严格隐私约束下实现可扩展、个性化的多机构脑肿瘤分割，兼顾性能与数据安全。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is critical in diagnosis and treatment planning for the disease. Yet, current deep learning methods rely on centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and limits generalization across diverse institutions. In this paper, we propose TwinSegNet, which is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates a hybrid ViT-UNet model with personalized digital twins for accurate and real-time brain tumor segmentation. Our architecture combines convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks to capture local and global context. Each institution fine-tunes the global model of private data to form its digital twin. Evaluated on nine heterogeneous MRI datasets, including BraTS 2019-2021 and custom tumor collections, TwinSegNet achieves high Dice scores (up to 0.90%) and sensitivity/specificity exceeding 90%, demonstrating robustness across non-independent and identically distributed (IID) client distributions. Comparative results against centralized models such as TumorVisNet highlight TwinSegNet's effectiveness in preserving privacy without sacrificing performance. Our approach enables scalable, personalized segmentation for multi-institutional clinical settings while adhering to strict data confidentiality requirements.

TL;DR: 提出LumiCtrl方法，通过单张图像学习光照提示，实现对文本到图像模型中场景光照的精确控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型缺乏对场景光照的精确控制，而光照是影响图像情绪、氛围和视觉美感的关键因素。

Method: LumiCtrl包含三部分：(a) 基于物理的普朗克轨迹光照增强；(b) 利用冻结ControlNet的边缘引导提示解耦，聚焦光照而非结构；(c) 前景掩码重建损失，实现上下文光照自适应。

Result: 在光照保真度、审美质量和场景一致性上显著优于现有个性化方法，人类偏好实验也验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: LumiCtrl有效实现了单图光照个性化生成，为图像创作提供了更精准的光照控制工具。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable progress in creative image generation, yet they still lack precise control over scene illuminants, which is a crucial factor for content designers aiming to manipulate the mood, atmosphere, and visual aesthetics of generated images. In this paper, we present an illuminant personalization method named LumiCtrl that learns an illuminant prompt given a single image of an object. LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines. A human preference study further confirms strong user preference for LumiCtrl outputs. The code and data will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MMLANDMARKS多模态地标数据集，整合航拍、地面图像、文本和地理坐标，推动地理空间多模态理解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理空间基准模态覆盖有限，无法统一整合多模态信息，限制了领域进展

Method: 构建包含19.7万航拍图、32.9万地面图、文本描述和地理坐标的18,557个地标数据集，实现模态一一对应

Result: 基于CLIP风格基线模型，在跨视图检索、地理定位等任务上表现优异，超越现有基础与专用模型

Conclusion: 多模态统一数据集对实现全面地理空间理解至关重要，MMLANDMARKS为未来研究提供了坚实基准

Abstract: Geo-spatial analysis of our world benefits from a multimodal approach, as every single geographic location can be described in numerous ways (images from various viewpoints, textual descriptions, and geographic coordinates). Current geo-spatial benchmarks have limited coverage across modalities, considerably restricting progress in the field, as current approaches cannot integrate all relevant modalities within a unified framework. We introduce the Multi-Modal Landmark dataset (MMLANDMARKS), a benchmark composed of four modalities: 197k highresolution aerial images, 329k ground-view images, textual information, and geographic coordinates for 18,557 distinct landmarks in the United States. The MMLANDMARKS dataset has a one-to-one correspondence across every modality, which enables training and benchmarking models for various geo-spatial tasks, including cross-view Ground-to-Satellite retrieval, ground and satellite geolocalization, Text-to-Image, and Text-to-GPS retrieval. We demonstrate broad generalization and competitive performance against off-the-shelf foundational models and specialized state-of-the-art models across different tasks by employing a simple CLIP-inspired baseline, illustrating the necessity for multimodal datasets to achieve broad geo-spatial understanding.

TL;DR: 提出GroundingME基准，揭示多模态大模型在视觉接地任务中存在严重能力缺口，尤其在拒识未接地查询时大量幻觉，通过测试时扩展和数据混合训练可部分提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准过于简化，无法评估模型是否真正具备人类级别的视觉接地能力，尤其是处理模糊、遮挡和无法接地的查询时。

Method: 构建GroundingME基准，包含1005个挑战性样本，涵盖四种复杂场景：区分相似物体、空间关系、遮挡/微小物体、拒识不可接地查询；评估25个SOTA模型，并测试两种改进策略：测试时扩展与数据混合训练。

Result: 最佳模型仅达45.1%准确率，多数模型在拒识任务上得0%，表现出严重幻觉；测试时扩展提升复杂接地达2.9%，数据混合训练使拒识准确率从0%提升至27.9%。

Conclusion: GroundingME揭示了当前MLLMs远未达到人类水平的视觉接地能力，是诊断模型缺陷与推动安全可靠视觉语言理解的重要工具。

Abstract: Visual grounding, localizing objects from natural language descriptions, represents a critical bridge between language and vision understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI病理系统多基于欧美数据，缺乏对中东等代表性不足地区的验证，而这些地区更需要AI支持。

Method: 使用伊拉克库尔德斯坦地区339例前列腺活检样本，评估端到端AI模型和两种基础模型，对比病理医生判断并测试三种扫描仪下的稳定性。

Result: AI与病理医生的一致性（Kappa=0.801）与医生间一致性（Kappa=0.799）无显著差异，跨扫描仪一致性均高于0.90，包括低成本设备。

Conclusion: AI在前列腺病理评估中表现优异，低成本扫描仪有助于推动资源有限地区的公平AI部署，本研究提供中东首个公开数字病理数据集。

Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is improving the efficiency and accuracy of cancer diagnostics. The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.
  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).
  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.
  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes. This first openly available digital pathology dataset from the Middle East supports further research into globally equitable AI pathology.

Result: 在多样真实场景中生成几何合理、视觉连贯的物体插入结果，性能显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: InsertAnywhere为可控视频编辑提供了高保真物体插入的新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have opened new possibilities for controllable video editing, yet realistic video object insertion (VOI) remains challenging due to limited 4D scene understanding and inadequate handling of occlusion and lighting effects. We present InsertAnywhere, a new VOI framework that achieves geometrically consistent object placement and appearance-faithful video synthesis. Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework produces geometrically plausible and visually coherent object insertions across diverse real world scenarios, significantly outperforming existing research and commercial models.

TL;DR: FALCON-SFOD通过空间正则化和噪声鲁棒伪标签提升无源域目标检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFOD方法依赖Mean-Teacher生成伪标签，但域偏移导致背景干扰增强、目标表征弱化，伪标签不可靠；现有工作仅优化伪标签，忽视特征空间本身的强化

Method: 提出FALCON-SFOD框架，包含SPAR（利用OV-SAM的类别无关掩码正则化特征空间，增强前景聚焦）和IRPL（基于不平衡噪声鲁棒性理论设计伪标签策略）两个组件

Result: 在多个SFOD基准上取得竞争性性能，理论分析表明其能 tighter 地约束定位与分类误差边界

Conclusion: 强化特征空间的前景聚焦能力比单纯优化伪标签更有效，FALCON-SFOD为无源域检测提供了新范式

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art approaches in Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) typically rely on Mean-Teacher self-labeling. However, domain shift often reduces the detector's ability to maintain strong object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter. This weak object focus results in unreliable pseudo-labels from the detection head. While prior works mainly refine these pseudo-labels, they overlook the underlying need to strengthen the feature space itself. We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space. Using class-agnostic binary masks derived from OV-SAM, SPAR promotes structured and foreground-focused activations by guiding the network toward object regions. IRPL (Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling) complements SPAR by promoting balanced and noise-tolerant learning under severe foreground-background imbalance. Guided by a theoretical analysis that connects these designs to tighter localization and classification error bounds, FALCON-SFOD achieves competitive performance across SFOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: 显式建模视觉退化是提升多模态模型实际鲁棒性的关键，Robust-R1为可解释、可调优的鲁棒推理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring realistic degradations synthesized across four critical real-world visual processing stages, each annotated with structured chains connecting degradation parameters, perceptual influence, pristine semantic reasoning chain, and conclusion. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness: Robust-R1 outperforms all general and robust baselines on the real-world degradation benchmark R-Bench, while maintaining superior anti-degradation performance under multi-intensity adversarial degradations on MMMB, MMStar, and RealWorldQA.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模视频数据驱动的3D语义重建提供了新范式，突破了对3D标注和固定视角的依赖。

Abstract: We present FLEG, a feed-forward network that reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussians from any views. Previous straightforward solutions combine feed-forward reconstruction with Gaussian heads but suffer from fixed input views and insufficient 3D training data. In contrast, we propose a 3D-annotation-free training framework for 2D-to-3D lifting from arbitrary uncalibrated and unposed multi-view images. Since the framework does not require 3D annotations, we can leverage large-scale video data with easily obtained 2D instance information to enrich semantic embedding. We also propose an instance-guided contrastive learning to align 2D semantics with the 3D representations. In addition, to mitigate the high memory and computational cost of dense views, we further propose a geometry-semantic hierarchical sparsification strategy. Our FLEG efficiently reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussian representation in a feed-forward manner from arbitrary sparse or dense views, jointly producing accurate geometry, high-fidelity appearance, and language-aligned semantics. Extensive experiments show that it outperforms existing methods on various related tasks. Project page: https://fangzhou2000.github.io/projects/fleg.

Abstract: With 3D data rapidly emerging as an important form of multimedia information, 3D human mesh recovery technology has also advanced accordingly. However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios. The code and model for ClothHMR are available at: \url{https://github.com/starVisionTeam/ClothHMR}.

Conclusion: 几何先验对自监督3D高斯溅射至关重要，G3Splat显著提升几何准确性和泛化性能

Abstract: 3D Gaussians have recently emerged as an effective scene representation for real-time splatting and accurate novel-view synthesis, motivating several works to adapt multi-view structure prediction networks to regress per-pixel 3D Gaussians from images. However, most prior work extends these networks to predict additional Gaussian parameters -- orientation, scale, opacity, and appearance -- while relying almost exclusively on view-synthesis supervision. We show that a view-synthesis loss alone is insufficient to recover geometrically meaningful splats in this setting. We analyze and address the ambiguities of learning 3D Gaussian splats under self-supervision for pose-free generalizable splatting, and introduce G3Splat, which enforces geometric priors to obtain geometrically consistent 3D scene representations. Trained on RE10K, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in (i) geometrically consistent reconstruction, (ii) relative pose estimation, and (iii) novel-view synthesis. We further demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization on ScanNet, substantially outperforming prior work in both geometry recovery and relative pose estimation. Code and pretrained models are released on our project page (https://m80hz.github.io/g3splat/).

Abstract: T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are important for diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring of brain tumors. Depending on the brain tumor type, the FLAIR hyperintensity volume is an important measure to asses the tumor volume or surrounding edema, and an automatic segmentation of this would be useful in the clinic. In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS. The unified model achieved an average Dice score of 88.65\% for pre-operative meningiomas, 80.08% for pre-operative metastasis, 90.92% for pre-operative and 84.60% for post-operative gliomas from BraTS, and 84.47% for pre-operative and 61.27\% for post-operative lower grade gliomas. In addition, the results showed that the unified model achieved comparable segmentation performance to the dataset specific models on their respective datasets, and enables generalization across tumor types and acquisition time points, which facilitates the deployment in a clinical setting. The model is integrated into Raidionics, an open-source software for CNS tumor analysis.

Abstract: Virtual furniture synthesis, which seamlessly integrates reference objects into indoor scenes while maintaining geometric coherence and visual realism, holds substantial promise for home design and e-commerce applications. However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the parameter-sharing mechanism enforces aligned feature representations, facilitating precise geometric transformations, texture preservation, and seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate that RoomEditor++ is superior over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and human preference studies, while highlighting its strong generalization to unseen indoor scenes and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: 首次将扩散模型引入视频SCI重建，实现了硬件调制与软件算法的协同优化，为高保真动态成像提供新范式。

Abstract: Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures dynamic scene sequences through a two-dimensional (2D) snapshot, fundamentally relying on optical modulation for hardware compression and the corresponding software reconstruction. While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction. Experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Benchmarking competitions are central to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, defining performance standards and shaping methodological progress. However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks provide data that are sufficiently representative, accessible, and reusable to support clinically meaningful AI. In this work, we assess fairness along two complementary dimensions: (1) whether challenge datasets are representative of real-world clinical diversity, and (2) whether they are accessible and legally reusable in line with the FAIR principles. To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity. Despite their widespread influence, challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive or ambiguous access conditions, inconsistent or non-compliant licensing practices, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and long-term reuse. Together, these shortcomings expose foundational fairness limitations in our benchmarking ecosystem and highlight a disconnect between leaderboard success and clinical relevance.

Motivation: 现有基于MLLM的无微调方法依赖文本输出，存在信息损失、正常性偏差和提示敏感问题，难以捕捉细微异常。

Method: 通过鲁棒注意力头识别模块，多准则分析注意力头的显著性与稳定性，筛选出稀疏但判别性强的头，再用轻量级打分器与时间定位器进行异常检测。

Conclusion: 直接利用MLLM内部注意力头进行异常检测，是一种高效、可解释且实用的无微调解决方案。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate events that deviate from normal patterns in videos. Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 视觉提示评估需标准化设计细节，VPBench提供更可靠的基准，已开源发布。

Abstract: A key challenge in evaluating VLMs is testing models' ability to analyze visual content independently from their textual priors. Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations. To mitigate this instability, we curate existing datasets to create VPBench, a larger visually prompted benchmark with 16 visual marker variants. VPBench and additional analysis tools are released at https://lisadunlap.github.io/vpbench/.

Abstract: Robust mammography registration is essential for clinical applications like tracking disease progression and monitoring longitudinal changes in breast tissue. However, progress has been limited by the absence of public datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are often not directly comparable, as they use private data and inconsistent evaluation frameworks. To address this, we present MGRegBench, a public benchmark dataset for mammogram registration. It comprises over 5,000 image pairs, with 100 containing manual anatomical landmarks and segmentation masks for rigorous evaluation. This makes MGRegBench one of the largest public 2D registration datasets with manual annotations. Using this resource, we benchmarked diverse registration methods including classical (ANTs), learning-based (VoxelMorph, TransMorph), implicit neural representation (IDIR), a classic mammography-specific approach, and a recent state-of-the-art deep learning method MammoRegNet. The implementations were adapted to this modality from the authors' implementations or re-implemented from scratch. Our contributions are: (1) the first public dataset of this scale with manual landmarks and masks for mammography registration; (2) the first like-for-like comparison of diverse methods on this modality; and (3) an extensive analysis of deep learning-based registration. We publicly release our code and data to establish a foundational resource for fair comparisons and catalyze future research.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for multi-class segmentation of medical images are widely used today. Especially models with multiple outputs that can separately predict segmentation classes (regions) without relying on a probabilistic formulation of the segmentation of regions. These models allow for more precise segmentation by tailoring the network's components to each class (region). They have a common encoder part of the architecture but branch out at the output layers, leading to improved accuracy.
  These methods are used to diagnose type B aortic dissection (TBAD), which requires accurate segmentation of aortic structures based on the ImageTBDA dataset, which contains 100 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. These images identify three key classes: true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) of the aorta, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment decisions. In the dataset, 68 examples have a false lumen, while the remaining 32 do not, creating additional complexity for pathology detection.
  However, implementing these CNN methods requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data. Obtaining accurate labels for the regions of interest can be an expensive and time-consuming process, particularly for 3D data. Semi-supervised learning methods allow models to be trained by using both labeled and unlabeled data, which is a promising approach for overcoming the challenge of obtaining accurate labels. However, these learning methods are not well understood for models with multiple outputs.
  This paper presents a semi-supervised learning method for models with multiple outputs. The method is based on the additional rotations and flipping, and does not assume the probabilistic nature of the model's responses. This makes it a universal approach, which is especially important for architectures that involve separate segmentation.

Result: 在多个基准上显著提升深度估计的准确性和真实感，超越DA-V2。

Conclusion: 该方法开辟了通过增强几何推理实现自监督深度估计的新途径。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation remains challenging as recent foundation models, such as Depth Anything V2 (DA-V2), struggle with real-world images that are far from the training distribution. We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder. Across diverse benchmarks, Re-Depth Anything yields substantial gains in depth accuracy and realism over the DA-V2, showcasing new avenues for self-supervision by augmenting geometric reasoning.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) quantitative MRI (qMRI) relaxometry provides objective tissue characterization but remains clinically underutilized due to lengthy acquisition times. We propose a physics-informed, self-supervised framework for qMRI super-resolution that uses routinely acquired HR weighted MRI (wMRI) scans as guidance, thus, removing the necessity for HR qMRI ground truth during training. We formulate super-resolution as Bayesian maximum a posteriori inference, minimizing two discrepancies: (1) between HR images synthesized from super-resolved qMRI maps and acquired wMRI guides via forward signal models, and (2) between acquired LR qMRI and downsampled predictions. This physics-informed objective allows the models to learn from clinical wMRI without HR qMRI supervision. To validate the concept, we generate training data by synthesizing wMRI guides from HR qMRI using signal equations, then degrading qMRI resolution via k-space truncation. A deep neural network learns the super-resolution mapping. Ablation experiments demonstrate that T1-weighted images primarily enhance T1 maps, T2-weighted images improve T2 maps, and combined guidance optimally enhances all parameters simultaneously. Validation on independently acquired in-vivo data from a different qMRI sequence confirms cross-qMRI sequence generalizability. Models trained on synthetic data can produce super-resolved maps from a 1-minute acquisition with quality comparable to a 5-minute reference scan, leveraging the scanner-independent nature of relaxometry parameters. By decoupling training from HR qMRI requirement, our framework enables fast qMRI acquisitions enhanced via routine clinical images, offering a practical pathway for integrating quantitative relaxometry into clinical workflows with acceptable additional scan time.

Conclusion: 时间立体建模有效解决深度模糊问题，为2D引导的3D检测提供了高精度、高效率的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved notable progress in computational pathology (CPath), the gigapixel scale and spatial heterogeneity of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) continue to pose challenges for multimodal understanding. Existing alignment methods struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between textual descriptions and visual cues across thousands of patches from a slide, compromising their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding. By harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs), PathFLIP can seamlessly follow diverse clinical instructions and adapt to varied diagnostic contexts. Furthermore, it exhibits versatile capabilities across multiple paradigms, efficiently handling slide-level classification and retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathFLIP outperforms existing large-scale pathological VLMs on four representative benchmarks while requiring significantly less training data, paving the way for fine-grained, instruction-aware WSI interpretation in clinical practice.

Conclusion: GRASP-HO为开放世界HOI检测提供新范式，有效融合大语言模型的知识与视觉感知能力，突破传统分类框架的局限。

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs and the interactions between them. Existing methods operate under a closed-world assumption, treating the task as a classification problem over a small, predefined verb set, which struggles to generalize to the long-tail of unseen or ambiguous interactions in the wild. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem. To bridge the vision and cognitive, we first extract hybrid interaction representations, then design a lightweight learnable cognitive steering conduit (CSC) module to inject the fine-grained visual evidence into a frozen MLLM for effective reasoning. To address the supervision mismatch between classification-based HOI datasets and open-vocabulary generative models, we introduce a hybrid guidance strategy that coupling the language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss, enabling discriminative grounding without sacrificing generative flexibility. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art closed-set performance and strong zero-shot generalization, achieving a unified paradigm that seamlessly bridges discriminative perception and generative reasoning for open-world HOI detection.

Result: 在四大指令视频编辑任务上表现优越，并构建了50万对指令-视频的高质量数据集ReCo-Data。

Conclusion: ReCo有效解决了指令视频编辑中的区域干扰问题，为未来研究提供了新范式与数据资源。

Abstract: The In-context generation paradigm recently has demonstrated strong power in instructional image editing with both data efficiency and synthesis quality. Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training. Extensive experiments conducted on four major instruction-based video editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposal.

Conclusion: Bitbox有望加速计算行为测量在行为、临床和心理健康研究中的广泛应用，并推动社区驱动的持续发展。

Abstract: Computational measurement of human behavior from video has recently become feasible due to major advances in AI. These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research. Bitbox has been designed from the beginning as a community-driven effort that will evolve through contributions from both method developers and domain scientists.

Result: 在EVE数据集上达到SOTA性能，无论是否进行个体适应，且实验证明保留帧内空间上下文优于早期空间池化

Conclusion: ST-Gaze为使用普通摄像头实现更鲁棒的视频眼动估计提供了新方向

Abstract: Video-based gaze estimation methods aim to capture the inherently temporal dynamics of human eye gaze from multiple image frames. However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.

Result: 条件步长是主导因素，步长在[2.0, 3.0]时表现最优，远超扩散步数的影响。

Conclusion: 应优先优化条件步长而非增加扩散步数，以高效提升重建质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong potential for solving inverse problems such as single-image super-resolution, where a high-resolution image is recovered from a low-resolution observation using a pretrained unconditional prior. Conditioning methods, including Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Manifold Constrained Gradient (MCG), can substantially improve reconstruction quality, but they introduce additional hyperparameters that require careful tuning. In this work, we conduct an empirical ablation study on FFHQ super-resolution to identify the dominant factors affecting performance when applying conditioning to pretrained diffusion models, and show that the conditioning step size has a significantly greater impact than the diffusion step count, with step sizes in the range of [2.0, 3.0] yielding the best overall performance in our experiments.

Abstract: We present FlexAvatar, a flexible large reconstruction model for high-fidelity 3D head avatars with detailed dynamic deformation from single or sparse images, without requiring camera poses or expression labels. It leverages a transformer-based reconstruction model with structured head query tokens as canonical anchor to aggregate flexible input-number-agnostic, camera-pose-free and expression-free inputs into a robust canonical 3D representation. For detailed dynamic deformation, we introduce a lightweight UNet decoder conditioned on UV-space position maps, which can produce detailed expression-dependent deformations in real time. To better capture rare but critical expressions like wrinkles and bared teeth, we also adopt a data distribution adjustment strategy during training to balance the distribution of these expressions in the training set. Moreover, a lightweight 10-second refinement can further enhances identity-specific details in extreme identities without affecting deformation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FlexAvatar achieves superior 3D consistency, detailed dynamic realism compared with previous methods, providing a practical solution for animatable 3D avatar creation.

Conclusion: SAVeD填补了真实ADAS风险数据空白，为安全研究提供新基准，推动ADAS系统在复杂边缘场景中的感知与决策优化。

Abstract: The advancement of safety-critical research in driving behavior in ADAS-equipped vehicles require real-world datasets that not only include diverse traffic scenarios but also capture high-risk edge cases such as near-miss events and system failures. However, existing datasets are largely limited to either simulated environments or human-driven vehicle data, lacking authentic ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) vehicle behavior under risk conditions. To address this gap, this paper introduces SAVeD, a large-scale video dataset curated from publicly available social media content, explicitly focused on ADAS vehicle-related crashes, near-miss incidents, and disengagements. SAVeD features 2,119 first-person videos, capturing ADAS vehicle operations in diverse locations, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios. The dataset includes video frame-level annotations for collisions, evasive maneuvers, and disengagements, enabling analysis of both perception and decision-making failures. We demonstrate SAVeD's utility through multiple analyses and contributions: (1) We propose a novel framework integrating semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation to compute real-time Time-to-Collision (TTC) for dynamic objects. (2) We utilize the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to model and quantify the extreme risk in crash and near-miss events across different roadway types. (3) We establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2 and InternVL2.5 HiCo R16), showing that SAVeD's detailed annotations significantly enhance model performance through domain adaptation in complex near-miss scenarios.

Conclusion: MambaMIL+有效解决WSI分析中的长序列与空间上下文建模难题，具有高鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) are an important data modality in computational pathology, yet their gigapixel resolution and lack of fine-grained annotations challenge conventional deep learning models. Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to the widespread availability of highly realistic synthetic media, increasing the difficulty of reliable deepfake detection. A key challenge is generalization, as detectors trained on a narrow class of generators often fail when confronted with unseen models. In this work, we address the pressing need for generalizable detection by leveraging large vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to identify synthetic content across diverse generative techniques. First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the framework's versatility through few-shot generalization (using as few as 320 images) and source attribution, enabling the precise identification of generator architectures in closed-set settings.

Conclusion: Pix2NPHM在保持实时性的同时显著提升重建质量，为大规模真实场景下的人脸3D重建提供了新范式。

Abstract: Neural Parametric Head Models (NPHMs) are a recent advancement over mesh-based 3d morphable models (3DMMs) to facilitate high-fidelity geometric detail. However, fitting NPHMs to visual inputs is notoriously challenging due to the expressive nature of their underlying latent space. To this end, we propose Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer (ViT) network that directly regresses NPHM parameters, given a single image as input. Compared to existing approaches, the neural parametric space allows our method to reconstruct more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions. For broad generalization, we exploit domain-specific ViTs as backbones, which are pretrained on geometric prediction tasks. We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps. As a result, we achieve unprecedented face reconstruction quality that can run at scale on in-the-wild data.

Conclusion: LiteGE在效率和鲁棒性上显著超越现有方法，为资源受限环境下的三维形状分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Computing geodesic distances on 3D surfaces is fundamental to many tasks in 3D vision and geometry processing, with deep connections to tasks such as shape correspondence. Recent learning-based methods achieve strong performance but rely on large 3D backbones, leading to high memory usage and latency, which limit their use in interactive or resource-constrained settings. We introduce LiteGE, a lightweight approach that constructs compact, category-aware shape descriptors by applying PCA to unsigned distance field (UDFs) samples at informative voxels. This descriptor is efficient to compute and removes the need for high-capacity networks. LiteGE remains robust on sparse point clouds, supporting inputs with as few as 300 points, where prior methods fail. Extensive experiments show that LiteGE reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 300$\times$ compared to existing neural approaches. In addition, by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between geodesic distance and shape correspondence, LiteGE enables fast and accurate shape matching. Our method achieves up to 1000$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy on non-isometric shape pairs, including evaluations on point-cloud inputs.

Result: 在20%-85%云覆盖的合成数据上，UrbanDIFF在85%云覆盖时SSIM达0.89、RMSE为1.2K、R2为0.84，性能劣化缓慢，显著优于插值基线。

Conclusion: UrbanDIFF为高云覆盖率下的城市地表温度重建提供了一种鲁棒、无需辅助数据的纯空间解决方案，适用于持续性SUHI监测。

Abstract: Satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) products are central to surface urban heat island (SUHI) monitoring due to their consistent grid-based coverage over large metropolitan regions. However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness.
  Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference.
  UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.

Conclusion: 该混合方法显著提升长距离 photogrammetry 性能，为CCTV相机校准提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate camera models are essential for photogrammetry applications such as 3D mapping and object localization, particularly for long distances. Various stereo-camera based 3D localization methods are available but are limited to few hundreds of meters' range. This is majorly due to the limitation of the distortion models assumed for the non-linearities present in the camera lens. This paper presents a framework for modeling a suitable distortion model that can be used for localizing the objects at longer distances. It is well known that neural networks can be a better alternative to model a highly complex non-linear lens distortion function; on contrary, it is observed that a direct application of neural networks to distortion models fails to converge to estimate the camera parameters. To resolve this, a hybrid approach is presented in this paper where the conventional distortion models are initially extended to incorporate higher-order terms and then enhanced using neural network based residual correction model. This hybrid approach has substantially improved long-range localization performance and is capable of estimating the 3D position of objects at distances up to 5 kilometres. The estimated 3D coordinates are transformed to GIS coordinates and are plotted on a GIS map for visualization. Experimental validation demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of proposed framework, offering a practical solution to calibrate CCTV cameras for long-range photogrammetry applications.

Existing methods mainly fall into two categories: (1) static world generation models, which construct 3D environments without active agents, and (2) controllable-entity models, which allow a single entity to perform limited actions in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters. Our evaluation covers a broad range of aspects, including visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence.

TL;DR: Chorus通过多教师蒸馏学习3D高斯泼溅的通用特征编码器，在多种任务上表现优异且数据效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）虽能高保真表示场景，但其原始元素直接编码通用特征尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出Chorus框架，利用2D基础模型作为多教师，通过共享3D编码器和特定投影器蒸馏语言对齐、通用和物体感知信号，构建统一嵌入空间。

Result: 在语义/实例分割、线性与解码器探针、数据高效监督等任务上表现优秀；仅用中心点、颜色、法线的变体在点云基准上超越基线，训练样本减少39.9倍；提出渲染-蒸馏微调方法提升跨域适应。

Conclusion: Chorus首次实现3DGS的通用特征学习，显著提升数据效率与迁移能力，为3D场景理解提供新范式。

Abstract: While 3DGS has emerged as a high-fidelity scene representation, encoding rich, general-purpose features directly from its primitives remains under-explored. We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.
  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes. Finally, we propose a render-and-distill adaptation that facilitates out-of-domain finetuning. Our code and model will be released upon publication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ML代理基准无法评估复杂医学影像任务中的端到端工作流，亟需一个更贴近真实场景的评估体系。

Method: 构建ReX-MLE基准，包含20个来自高影响力医学影像竞赛的挑战，要求代理独立完成数据预处理、模型训练与提交，受限于真实计算与时间约束。

Result: 主流代理（AIDE、ML-Master、R&D-Agent）在ReX-MLE上表现极差，多数排名低于0百分位，远低于人类专家水平。

Conclusion: ReX-MLE揭示了当前自主AI在专业领域的局限性，为发展领域感知的智能系统提供了关键评估基础。

Abstract: Autonomous coding agents built on large language models (LLMs) can now solve many general software and machine learning tasks, but they remain ineffective on complex, domain-specific scientific problems. Medical imaging is a particularly demanding domain, requiring long training cycles, high-dimensional data handling, and specialized preprocessing and validation pipelines, capabilities not fully measured in existing agent benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce ReX-MLE, a benchmark of 20 challenges derived from high-impact medical imaging competitions spanning diverse modalities and task types. Unlike prior ML-agent benchmarks, ReX-MLE evaluates full end-to-end workflows, requiring agents to independently manage data preprocessing, model training, and submission under realistic compute and time constraints. Evaluating state-of-the-art agents (AIDE, ML-Master, R&D-Agent) with different LLM backends (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude), we observe a severe performance gap: most submissions rank in the 0th percentile compared to human experts. Failures stem from domain-knowledge and engineering limitations. ReX-MLE exposes these bottlenecks and provides a foundation for developing domain-aware autonomous AI systems.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型因训练数据缺乏细粒度空间监督且文本嵌入无法有效编码空间语义，难以准确捕捉提示中的空间关系。

Method: 提出InfSplign，在每一步去噪中通过复合损失函数调整噪声，利用骨干解码器提取的多级交叉注意力图，约束对象位置与数量平衡。

Result: 在VISOR和T2I-CompBench上达到新SOTA，超越现有推理时方法，甚至优于微调方法。

Conclusion: InfSplign轻量、即插即用，兼容任意扩散模型，为文本到图像的空间对齐提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models generate high-quality images but often fail to capture the spatial relations specified in text prompts. This limitation can be traced to two factors: lack of fine-grained spatial supervision in training data and inability of text embeddings to encode spatial semantics. We introduce InfSplign, a training-free inference-time method that improves spatial alignment by adjusting the noise through a compound loss in every denoising step. Proposed loss leverages different levels of cross-attention maps extracted from the backbone decoder to enforce accurate object placement and a balanced object presence during sampling. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and compatible with any diffusion backbone. Our comprehensive evaluations on VISOR and T2I-CompBench show that InfSplign establishes a new state-of-the-art (to the best of our knowledge), achieving substantial performance gains over the strongest existing inference-time baselines and even outperforming the fine-tuning-based methods. Codebase is available at GitHub.

Conclusion: 物理知情学习框架为拉曼光谱在生物组织分析中的实用化提供了新途径。

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy enables non-destructive, label-free molecular analysis with high specificity, making it a powerful tool for biomedical diagnostics. However, its application to biological tissues is challenged by inherently weak Raman scattering and strong fluorescence background, which significantly degrade signal quality. In this study, we present a simulation-driven denoising framework that combines a statistically grounded noise model with deep learning to enhance Raman spectra acquired under fluorescence-dominated conditions. We comprehensively modeled major noise sources. Based on this model, we generated biologically realistic Raman spectra and used them to train a cascaded deep neural network designed to jointly suppress stochastic detector noise and fluorescence baseline interference. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we simulated human skin spectra derived from real experimental data as a validation case study. Our results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed learning to improve spectral quality and enable faster, more accurate Raman-based tissue analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型将数据扩散至白噪声导致重建困难且计算开销大

Method: InSPECT在正向和反向过程中保持不变的频谱特征，使傅里叶系数平滑收敛到指定噪声

Result: 在CIFAR-10、Celeb-A和LSUN上，相比DDPM，FID降低39.23%，IS提升45.80%

Conclusion: 首次在扩散模型中分析并保留不变频谱特征，显著提升生成质量、多样性和计算效率

Abstract: Modern diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However, the fundamental design choice of diffusing data all the way to white noise and then reconstructing it leads to an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze and preserve invariant spectral features in diffusion models.

Result: KCCs在不重训的情况下显著提升人机沟通效果，优于近期基线方法。

Conclusion: KCCs是提升ViT基础模型透明性与可靠性的关键一步。

Abstract: Current approaches for designing self-explainable models (SEMs) require complicated training procedures and specific architectures which makes them impractical. With the advance of general purpose foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), this impracticability becomes even more problematic. Therefore, new methods are necessary to provide transparency and reliability to ViT-based foundation models. In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs). Recent works have shown that ViTs can automatically identify matching keypoints between images with high precision, and we build on these results to create an easily interpretable decision process that is inherently visualizable in the input. We perform an extensive evaluation which show that KCCs improve the human-machine communication compared to recent baselines. We believe that KCCs constitute an important step towards making ViT-based foundation models more transparent and reliable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习发展，AI模型易受对抗攻击影响，尤其视觉模态可能被恶意修改以误导识别，亟需评估多模态模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 使用非目标PGD攻击对LLaVA-1.5-13B和Llama 3.2 Vision-8B在VQA v2子集上进行视觉输入扰动，通过VQA准确率衡量性能下降。

Result: Llama 3.2 Vision在高扰动下准确率下降幅度小于LLaVA，表明其具有更强的对抗鲁棒性，且鲁棒性与基准准确率无直接关联。

Conclusion: 视觉模态是攻击开放权重多模态模型的有效途径，模型鲁棒性受架构与训练因素影响，不能仅凭基准性能判断。

Abstract: With the increase in deep learning, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the model in which AI systems can identify objects. Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors.

Result: DWM能生成逼真且物理合理的交互视频，如抓取、打开、移动物体，同时保持相机与场景一致性

Conclusion: DWM是首个基于视频扩散的交互式数字孪生框架，为从自拍动作实现具身仿真提供了新路径

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has made it easy to create realistic digital twins from everyday environments. However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.
  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.
  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.

Abstract: Modern Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) typically operate in low-level Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent spaces that are primarily optimized for pixel-level reconstruction. To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.

Conclusion: MRMSTE框架通过融合风场信息与动态贝叶斯推理，实现了高效、可扩展的多机器人气体源估计，优于传统覆盖控制与静态传感器网络。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Robot Multi-Source Term Estimation (MRMSTE) framework that enables teams of mobile robots to collaboratively sample gas concentrations and infer the parameters of an unknown number of airborne releases. The framework is built on a hybrid Bayesian inference scheme that represents the joint multi-source probability density and incorporates physics-informed state transitions, including source birth, removal, and merging induced by atmospheric dispersion. A superposition-based measurement model is naturally accommodated, allowing sparse concentration measurements to be exploited efficiently. To guide robot deployment, we introduce a wind-aware coverage control (WCC) strategy that integrates the evolving multi-source belief with local wind information to prioritize regions of high detection likelihood. Unlike conventional coverage control or information-theoretic planners, WCC explicitly accounts for anisotropic plume transport when modelling sensor performance, leading to more effective sensor placement for multi-source estimation. Monte Carlo studies demonstrate faster convergence and improved separation of individual source beliefs compared to traditional coverage-based strategies and small-scale static sensor networks. Real-world experiments with CO2 releases using TurtleBot platforms further validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its practicality for scalable multi-robot gas-sensing applications.

Result: 实现了跨机器人、规划模式和操作任务的通用化语言驱动TAMP系统。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升TAMP系统的灵活性与可扩展性，推动语言指令驱动的机器人操作普及。

Abstract: Simulation is essential for developing robotic manipulation systems, particularly for task and motion planning (TAMP), where symbolic reasoning interfaces with geometric, kinematic, and physics-based execution. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable robots to generate symbolic plans from natural language, yet executing these plans in simulation often requires robot-specific engineering or planner-dependent integration. In this work, we present a unified pipeline that connects an LLM-based symbolic planner with the Kautham motion planning framework to achieve generalizable, robot-agnostic symbolic-to-geometric manipulation. Kautham provides ROS-compatible support for a wide range of industrial manipulators and offers geometric, kinodynamic, physics-driven, and constraint-based motion planning under a single interface. Our system converts language instructions into symbolic actions and computes and executes collision-free trajectories using any of Kautham's planners without additional coding. The result is a flexible and scalable tool for language-driven TAMP that is generalized across robots, planning modalities, and manipulation tasks.

Abstract: As the global population ages, many seniors face the problem of loneliness. Companion robots offer a potential solution. However, current companion robots often lack advanced functionality, while task-oriented robots are not designed for social interaction, limiting their suitability and acceptance by seniors. Our work introduces a senior-oriented system for quadruped robots that allows for more intuitive user input and provides more socially expressive output. For user input, we implemented a MediaPipe-based module for hand gesture and head movement recognition, enabling control without a remote. For output, we designed and trained robotic dog gestures using curriculum-based reinforcement learning in Isaac Gym, progressing from simple standing to three-legged balancing and leg extensions, and more. The final tests achieved over 95\% success on average in simulation, and we validated a key social gesture (the paw-lift) on a Unitree robot. Real-world tests demonstrated the feasibility and social expressiveness of this framework, while also revealing sim-to-real challenges in joint compliance, load distribution, and balance control. These contributions advance the development of practical quadruped robots as social companions for the senior and outline pathways for sim-to-real adaptation and inform future user studies.

Abstract: Interactive reinforcement learning (IRL) has shown promise in enabling autonomous agents and robots to learn complex behaviours from human teachers, yet the dynamics of teacher selection remain poorly understood. This paper reveals an unexpected phenomenon in IRL: when given a choice between teachers with different reward structures, learning agents overwhelmingly prefer conservative, low-reward teachers (93.16% selection rate) over those offering 20x higher rewards. Through 1,250 experimental runs in navigation tasks with multiple expert teachers, we discovered: (1) Conservative bias dominates teacher selection: agents systematically choose the lowest-reward teacher, prioritising consistency over optimality; (2) Critical performance thresholds exist at teacher availability rho >= 0.6 and accuracy omega >= 0.6, below which the framework fails catastrophically; (3) The framework achieves 159% improvement over baseline Q-learning under concept drift. These findings challenge fundamental assumptions about optimal teaching in RL and suggest potential implications for human-robot collaboration, where human preferences for safety and consistency may align with the observed agent selection behaviour, potentially informing training paradigms for safety-critical robotic applications.

Abstract: We present an innovative end-to-end framework for synthesizing semantically meaningful co-speech gestures and deploying them in real-time on a humanoid robot. This system addresses the challenge of creating natural, expressive non-verbal communication for robots by integrating advanced gesture generation techniques with robust physical control. Our core innovation lies in the meticulous integration of a semantics-aware gesture synthesis module, which derives expressive reference motions from speech input by leveraging a generative retrieval mechanism based on large language models (LLMs) and an autoregressive Motion-GPT model. This is coupled with a high-fidelity imitation learning control policy, the MotionTracker, which enables the Unitree G1 humanoid robot to execute these complex motions dynamically and maintain balance. To ensure feasibility, we employ a robust General Motion Retargeting (GMR) method to bridge the embodiment gap between human motion data and the robot platform. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our combined system produces semantically appropriate and rhythmically coherent gestures that are accurately tracked and executed by the physical robot. To our knowledge, this work represents a significant step toward general real-world use by providing a complete pipeline for automatic, semantic-aware, co-speech gesture generation and synchronized real-time physical deployment on a humanoid robot.

Abstract: In pipeline inspection, traditional tethered inspection robots are severely constrained by cable length and weight, which greatly limit their travel range and accessibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a self-propelled pipeline robot design based on force analysis and dynamic simulation, with a specific focus on solving core challenges including vertical climbing failure and poor passability in T-branch pipes. Adopting a wheeled configuration and modular design, the robot prioritizes the core demand of body motion control. Specifically, 3D modeling of the robot was first completed using SolidWorks. Subsequently, the model was imported into ADAMS for dynamic simulation, which provided a basis for optimizing the drive module and motion control strategy.To verify the robot's dynamic performance, an experimental platform with acrylic pipes was constructed. Through adjusting its body posture to surmount obstacles and select directions, the robot has demonstrated its ability to stably traverse various complex pipeline scenarios. Notably, this work offers a technical feasibility reference for the application of pipeline robots in the inspection of medium and low-pressure urban gas pipelines.

Abstract: In the field of gas pipeline location, existing pipeline location methods mostly rely on pipeline location instruments. However, when faced with complex and curved pipeline scenarios, these methods often fail due to problems such as cable entanglement and insufficient equipment flexibility. To address this pain point, we designed a self-propelled pipeline robot. This robot can autonomously complete the location work of complex and curved pipelines in complex pipe networks without external dragging. In terms of pipeline mapping technology, traditional visual mapping and laser mapping methods are easily affected by lighting conditions and insufficient features in the confined space of pipelines, resulting in mapping drift and divergence problems. In contrast, the pipeline location method that integrates inertial navigation and wheel odometers is less affected by pipeline environmental factors. Based on this, this paper proposes a pipeline robot location method based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Firstly, the body attitude angle is initially obtained through an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Then, the extended Kalman filtering algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of attitude angle estimation. Finally, high-precision pipeline location is achieved by combining wheel odometers. During the testing phase, the roll wheels of the pipeline robot needed to fit tightly against the pipe wall to reduce slippage. However, excessive tightness would reduce the flexibility of motion control due to excessive friction. Therefore, a balance needed to be struck between the robot's motion capability and positioning accuracy. Experiments were conducted using the self-propelled pipeline robot in a rectangular loop pipeline, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed dead reckoning algorithm.

Abstract: The growing use of service robots in hospitality highlights the need to understand how to effectively communicate with pre-occupied customers. This study investigates the efficacy of commonly used communication modalities by service robots, namely, acoustic/speech, visual display, and micromotion gestures in capturing attention and communicating intention with a user in a simulated restaurant scenario. We conducted a two-part user study (N=24) using a Temi robot to simulate delivery tasks, with participants engaged in a typing game (MonkeyType) to emulate a state of busyness. The participants' engagement in the typing game is measured by words per minute (WPM) and typing accuracy. In Part 1, we compared non-verbal acoustic cue versus baseline conditions to assess attention capture during a single-cup delivery task. In Part 2, we evaluated the effectiveness of speech, visual display, micromotion and their multimodal combination in conveying specific intentions (correct cup selection) during a two-cup delivery task. The results indicate that, while speech is highly effective in capturing attention, it is less successful in clearly communicating intention. Participants rated visual as the most effective modality for intention clarity, followed by speech, with micromotion being the lowest ranked.These findings provide insights into optimizing communication strategies for service robots, highlighting the distinct roles of attention capture and intention communication in enhancing user experience in dynamic hospitality settings.

Result: 实现了从自然语言提示自动生成符合标准的OWL动作本体，提升知识获取自动化水平。

Conclusion: LLM与RAG结合可有效自动化云机器人知识构建，推动RoboEarth体系向智能高效方向演进。

Abstract: RoboEarth was a pioneering initiative in cloud robotics, establishing a foundational framework for robots to share and exchange knowledge about actions, objects, and environments through a standardized knowledge graph. Initially, this knowledge was predominantly hand-crafted by engineers using RDF triples within OWL Ontologies, with updates, such as changes in an object's pose, being asserted by the robot's control and perception routines. However, with the advent and rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), we believe that the process of knowledge acquisition can be significantly automated. To this end, we propose RecipeMasterLLM, a high-level planner, that generates OWL action ontologies based on a standardized knowledge graph in response to user prompts. This architecture leverages a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained to understand and produce action descriptions consistent with the RoboEarth standardized knowledge graph. Moreover, during the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) phase, environmental knowledge is supplied to the LLM to enhance its contextual understanding and improve the accuracy of the generated action descriptions.

Conclusion: 神经符号分解提供了一种可扩展、有原则的方式，将语言理解与持续控制结合，推动可靠语言引导具身系统的构建。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have recently become effective tools for language-conditioned control in embodied systems, instability, slow convergence, and hallucinated actions continue to limit their direct application to continuous control. A modular neuro-symbolic control framework that clearly distinguishes between low-level motion execution and high-level semantic reasoning is proposed in this work. While a lightweight neural delta controller performs bounded, incremental actions in continuous space, a locally deployed LLM interprets symbolic tasks. We assess the suggested method in a planar manipulation setting with spatial relations between objects specified by language. Numerous tasks and local language models, such as Mistral, Phi, and LLaMA-3.2, are used in extensive experiments to compare LLM-only control, neural-only control, and the suggested LLM+DL framework. In comparison to LLM-only baselines, the results show that the neuro-symbolic integration consistently increases both success rate and efficiency, achieving average step reductions exceeding 70% and speedups of up to 8.83x while remaining robust to language model quality. The suggested framework enhances interpretability, stability, and generalization without any need of reinforcement learning or costly rollouts by controlling the LLM to symbolic outputs and allocating uninterpreted execution to a neural controller trained on artificial geometric data. These outputs show empirically that neuro-symbolic decomposition offers a scalable and principled way to integrate language understanding with ongoing control, this approach promotes the creation of dependable and effective language-guided embodied systems.

Conclusion: 该框架有效弥合仿真与现实差距，证明单目RGB图像足以支持复杂环境中的自主飞行。

Abstract: Modern autonomous navigation systems predominantly rely on lidar and depth cameras. However, a fundamental question remains: Can flying robots navigate in clutter using solely monocular RGB images? Given the prohibitive costs of real-world data collection, learning policies in simulation offers a promising path. Yet, deploying such policies directly in the physical world is hindered by the significant sim-to-real perception gap. Thus, we propose a framework that couples the photorealism of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) environments with Adversarial Domain Adaptation. By training in high-fidelity simulation while explicitly minimizing feature discrepancy, our method ensures the policy relies on domain-invariant cues. Experimental results demonstrate that our policy achieves robust zero-shot transfer to the physical world, enabling safe and agile flight in unstructured environments with varying illumination.

Conclusion: TakeAD有效缩小开环-闭环差距，通过偏好优化显著提升自动驾驶系统在接管场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Existing end-to-end autonomous driving methods typically rely on imitation learning (IL) but face a key challenge: the misalignment between open-loop training and closed-loop deployment. This misalignment often triggers driver-initiated takeovers and system disengagements during closed-loop execution. How to leverage those expert takeover data from disengagement scenarios and effectively expand the IL policy's capability presents a valuable yet unexplored challenge. In this paper, we propose TakeAD, a novel preference-based post-optimization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained IL policy with this disengagement data to enhance the closed-loop driving performance. First, we design an efficient expert takeover data collection pipeline inspired by human takeover mechanisms in real-world autonomous driving systems. Then, this post optimization framework integrates iterative Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for imitation learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for preference alignment. The DAgger stage equips the policy with fundamental capabilities to handle disengagement states through direct imitation of expert interventions. Subsequently, the DPO stage refines the policy's behavior to better align with expert preferences in disengagement scenarios. Through multiple iterations, the policy progressively learns recovery strategies for disengagement states, thereby mitigating the open-loop gap. Experiments on the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate our method's effectiveness compared with pure IL methods, with comprehensive ablations confirming the contribution of each component.

Abstract: Robot-aided gait rehabilitation facilitates high-intensity and repeatable therapy. However, most exoskeletons rely on pre-recorded, non-personalized gait trajectories constrained to the sagittal plane, potentially limiting movement naturalness and user comfort. We present a data-driven gait personalization framework for an exoskeleton that supports multi-planar motion, including hip abduction/adduction and pelvic translation and rotation. Personalized trajectories to individual participants were generated using regression models trained on anthropometric, demographic, and walking speed data from a normative database. In a within-subject experiment involving ten unimpaired participants, these personalized trajectories were evaluated in regard to comfort, naturalness, and overall experience and compared against two standard patterns from the same database: one averaging all the trajectories, and one randomly selected. We did not find relevant differences across pattern conditions, despite all trajectories being executed with high accuracy thanks to a stiff position-derivative controller. We found, however, that pattern conditions in later trials were rated as more comfortable and natural than those in the first trial, suggesting that participants might have adapted to walking within the exoskeleton, regardless of the enforced gait pattern. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating subjective feedback when designing personalized gait controllers and accounting for user adaptation during experimentation.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型通过场景想象与记忆机制，可有效实现无地图导航，凸显想象与记忆在空间推理中的关键作用。

Abstract: Visual navigation is a fundamental capability for autonomous home-assistance robots, enabling long-horizon tasks such as object search. While recent methods have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate commonsense reasoning and improve exploration efficiency, their planning remains constrained by textual representations, which cannot adequately capture spatial occupancy or scene geometry--critical factors for navigation decisions. We explore whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can achieve mapless visual navigation using only onboard RGB/RGB-D streams, unlocking their potential for spatial perception and planning. We achieve this through an imagination-powered navigation framework, ImagineNav++, which imagines future observation images from candidate robot views and translates navigation planning into a simple best-view image selection problem for VLMs. First, a future-view imagination module distills human navigation preferences to generate semantically meaningful viewpoints with high exploration potential. These imagined views then serve as visual prompts for the VLM to identify the most informative viewpoint. To maintain spatial consistency, we develop a selective foveation memory mechanism, which hierarchically integrates keyframe observations via a sparse-to-dense framework, constructing a compact yet comprehensive memory for long-term spatial reasoning. This approach transforms goal-oriented navigation into a series of tractable point-goal navigation tasks. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary object and instance navigation benchmarks show that ImagineNav++ achieves SOTA performance in mapless settings, even surpassing most map-based methods, highlighting the importance of scene imagination and memory in VLM-based spatial reasoning.

Abstract: This study presents an innovative hybrid Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) method for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that is resilient to environmental challenges and capable of dynamically assessing sensor reliability. Built upon a loosely coupled sensor fusion architecture, the system utilizes a novel hybrid Quaternion-focused Error-State EKF/UKF (Qf-ES-EKF/UKF) architecture to process inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This architecture first propagates the entire state using an Error-State Extended Kalman Filter (ESKF) and then applies a targeted Scaled Unscented Kalman Filter (SUKF) step to refine only the orientation. This sequential process blends the accuracy of SUKF in quaternion estimation with the overall computational efficiency of ESKF. The reliability of visual measurements is assessed via a dynamic sensor confidence score based on metrics, such as image entropy, intensity variation, motion blur, and inference quality, adapting the measurement noise covariance to ensure stable pose estimation even under challenging conditions. Comprehensive experimental analyses on the EuRoC MAV dataset demonstrate key advantages: an average improvement of 49% in position accuracy in challenging scenarios, an average of 57% in rotation accuracy over ESKF-based methods, and SUKF-comparable accuracy achieved with approximately 48% lower computational cost than a full SUKF implementation. These findings demonstrate that the presented approach strikes an effective balance between computational efficiency and estimation accuracy, and significantly enhances UAV pose estimation performance in complex environments with varying sensor reliability.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial navigation in dense natural environments remains challenging due to limited visibility, thin and irregular obstacles, GNSS-denied operation, and frequent perceptual degradation. This work presents an improved deep learning-based navigation framework that integrates semantically enhanced depth encoding with neural motion-primitive evaluation for robust flight in cluttered forests. Several modules are incorporated on top of the original sevae-ORACLE algorithm to address limitations observed during real-world deployment, including lateral control for sharper maneuvering, a temporal consistency mechanism to suppress oscillatory planning decisions, a stereo-based visual-inertial odometry solution for drift-resilient state estimation, and a supervisory safety layer that filters unsafe actions in real time. A depth refinement stage is included to improve the representation of thin branches and reduce stereo noise, while GPU optimization increases onboard inference throughput from 4 Hz to 10 Hz.
  The proposed approach is evaluated against several existing learning-based navigation methods under identical environmental conditions and hardware constraints. It demonstrates higher success rates, more stable trajectories, and improved collision avoidance, particularly in highly cluttered forest settings. The system is deployed on a custom quadrotor in three boreal forest environments, achieving fully autonomous completion in all flights in moderate and dense clutter, and 12 out of 15 flights in highly dense underbrush. These results demonstrate improved reliability and safety over existing navigation methods in complex natural environments.

Abstract: Ensuring human safety in collaborative robotics can compromise efficiency because traditional safety measures increase robot cycle time when human interaction is frequent. This paper proposes a safety-aware approach to mitigate efficiency losses without assuming prior knowledge of safety logic. Using a deep-learning model, the robot learns the relationship between system state and safety-induced speed reductions based on execution data. Our framework does not explicitly predict human motions but directly models the interaction effects on robot speed, simplifying implementation and enhancing generalizability to different safety logics. At runtime, the learned model optimizes task selection to minimize cycle time while adhering to safety requirements. Experiments on a pick-and-packaging scenario demonstrated significant reductions in cycle times.

Abstract: Whole-body control of robotic manipulators with awareness of full-arm kinematics is crucial for many manipulation scenarios involving body collision avoidance or body-object interactions, which makes it insufficient to consider only the end-effector poses in policy learning. The typical approach for whole-arm manipulation is to learn actions in the robot's joint space. However, the unalignment between the joint space and actual task space (i.e., 3D space) increases the complexity of policy learning, as generalization in task space requires the policy to intrinsically understand the non-linear arm kinematics, which is difficult to learn from limited demonstrations. To address this issue, this letter proposes a kinematics-aware imitation learning framework with consistent task, observation, and action spaces, all represented in the same 3D space. Specifically, we represent both robot states and actions using a set of 3D points on the arm body, naturally aligned with the 3D point cloud observations. This spatially consistent representation improves the policy's sample efficiency and spatial generalizability while enabling full-body control. Built upon the diffusion policy, we further incorporate kinematics priors into the diffusion processes to guarantee the kinematic feasibility of output actions. The joint angle commands are finally calculated through an optimization-based whole-body inverse kinematics solver for execution. Simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate higher success rates and stronger spatial generalizability of our approach compared to existing methods in body-aware manipulation policy learning.

Abstract: In Human-Robot Collaboration, safety mechanisms such as Speed and Separation Monitoring and Power and Force Limitation dynamically adjust the robot's speed based on human proximity. While essential for risk reduction, these mechanisms introduce slowdowns that makes cycle time estimation a hard task and impact job scheduling efficiency. Existing methods for estimating cycle times or designing schedulers often rely on predefined safety models, which may not accurately reflect real-world safety implementations, as these depend on case-specific risk assessments. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to predict the robot's safety scaling factor directly from process execution data. We analyze multiple neural network architectures and demonstrate that a simple feed-forward network effectively estimates the robot's slowdown. This capability is crucial for improving cycle time predictions and designing more effective scheduling algorithms in collaborative robotic environments.

The complete problem is treated as black-box, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to balance conflicting Key-Performance Indicators (KPIs). We demonstrate improvements in cycle time, task sequencing, and adaptation to human presence in a collaborative box-packing scenario.

Conclusion: Vidarc为数据稀缺场景下的机器人闭环控制提供了高效、鲁棒的新范式。

Abstract: Robotic arm manipulation in data-scarce settings is a highly challenging task due to the complex embodiment dynamics and diverse contexts. Recent video-based approaches have shown great promise in capturing and transferring the temporal and physical interactions by pre-training on Internet-scale video data. However, such methods are often not optimized for the embodiment-specific closed-loop control, typically suffering from high latency and insufficient grounding. In this paper, we present Vidarc (Video Diffusion for Action Reasoning and Closed-loop Control), a novel autoregressive embodied video diffusion approach augmented by a masked inverse dynamics model. By grounding video predictions with action-relevant masks and incorporating real-time feedback through cached autoregressive generation, Vidarc achieves fast, accurate closed-loop control. Pre-trained on one million cross-embodiment episodes, Vidarc surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving at least a 15% higher success rate in real-world deployment and a 91% reduction in latency. We also highlight its robust generalization and error correction capabilities across previously unseen robotic platforms.

*Ana Stankovic,Mohamed Khalil Ben-Larbi,Wolfgang H. Müller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种基于对偶四元数的RRT*运动规划器，用于在禁入区约束下生成卫星交会对接的平滑六自由度轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RRT*使用独立平移和四元数插值，难以保证位姿连续性与碰撞避免效果，需更优的SE(3)流形表示方法。

Method: 将对偶四元数代数直接嵌入RRT*框架，实现自然的螺旋运动插值，基于Python实现并在多障碍场景中验证。

Result: 相比传统RRT*，所提方法显著提升位姿连续性与避障性能，但为纯运动学方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为初步轨迹生成器，后续需结合轨道动力学进行优化以满足实际任务需求。

Abstract: This paper proposes a sampling-based motion planner that employs a dual quaternion representation to generate smooth, collision-free six-degree-of-freedom pose trajectories for satellite rendezvous and docking under keep-out zone constraints. The proposed planner integrates the dual quaternion algebra directly into an RRT* framework, thereby enabling natural screw motion interpolation in SE(3). The dual quaternion-based RRT* has been implemented in Python and demonstrated on a representative multi-obstacle scenario. A comparison with a standard RRT* using separate translation and quaternion steering highlights the enhanced pose continuity and obstacle avoidance of the proposed method. The present approach is purely kinematic in nature and does not take into account relative orbital dynamics. Consequently, the resulting path provides a preliminary estimate for a subsequent optimisation-based trajectory planner, which will refine the motion with dynamic constraints for the purpose of practical satellite rendezvous and docking missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉方法在遮挡、高维状态、低特征和噪声环境下性能差，亟需鲁棒的DLO感知方案。

Method: 采用扩散模型建模部分点云到高维状态的条件生成问题，统一处理单帧估计与跨帧跟踪。

Conclusion: UniStateDLO实现了强鲁棒性、高数据效率和真实环境泛化能力，为约束环境下的柔性物体操作提供了可靠感知基础。

Abstract: Perception of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as cables, ropes, and wires, is the cornerstone for successful downstream manipulation. Although vision-based methods have been extensively explored, they remain highly vulnerable to occlusions that commonly arise in constrained manipulation environments due to surrounding obstacles, large and varying deformations, and limited viewpoints. Moreover, the high dimensionality of the state space, the lack of distinctive visual features, and the presence of sensor noises further compound the challenges of reliable DLO perception. To address these open issues, this paper presents UniStateDLO, the first complete DLO perception pipeline with deep-learning methods that achieves robust performance under severe occlusion, covering both single-frame state estimation and cross-frame state tracking from partial point clouds. Both tasks are formulated as conditional generative problems, leveraging the strong capability of diffusion models to capture the complex mapping between highly partial observations and high-dimensional DLO states. UniStateDLO effectively handles a wide range of occlusion patterns, including initial occlusion, self-occlusion, and occlusion caused by multiple objects. In addition, it exhibits strong data efficiency as the entire network is trained solely on a large-scale synthetic dataset, enabling zero-shot sim-to-real generalization without any real-world training data. Comprehensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that UniStateDLO outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in both estimation and tracking, producing globally smooth yet locally precise DLO state predictions in real time, even under substantial occlusions. Its integration as the front-end module in a closed-loop DLO manipulation system further demonstrates its ability to support stable feedback control in complex, constrained 3-D environments.

Motivation: 解决传统离线规划中策略学习与规划分离导致的训练-推理不匹配问题，提升在噪声数据下的鲁棒性。

Method: 学习目标条件能量函数，用梯度下降优化轨迹，自监督后见之明重标记训练，多候选轨迹选择低能量解。

Result: 在OGBench任务上达到95%成功率，显著超越之前方法（68%），且在噪声数据上表现更优。

Conclusion: 基于验证的轨迹评估与优化比直接策略学习更适合离线无奖励规划场景。

Abstract: We present Planning as Descent (PaD), a framework for offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning that grounds trajectory synthesis in verification. Instead of learning a policy or explicit planner, PaD learns a goal-conditioned energy function over entire latent trajectories, assigning low energy to feasible, goal-consistent futures. Planning is realized as gradient-based refinement in this energy landscape, using identical computation during training and inference to reduce train-test mismatch common in decoupled modeling pipelines.
  PaD is trained via self-supervised hindsight goal relabeling, shaping the energy landscape around the planning dynamics. At inference, multiple trajectory candidates are refined under different temporal hypotheses, and low-energy plans balancing feasibility and efficiency are selected.
  We evaluate PaD on OGBench cube manipulation tasks. When trained on narrow expert demonstrations, PaD achieves state-of-the-art 95\% success, strongly outperforming prior methods that peak at 68\%. Remarkably, training on noisy, suboptimal data further improves success and plan efficiency, highlighting the benefits of verification-driven planning. Our results suggest learning to evaluate and refine trajectories provides a robust alternative to direct policy learning for offline, reward-free planning.

Abstract: Generalist robot learning remains constrained by data: large-scale, diverse, and high-quality interaction data are expensive to collect in the real world. While simulation has become a promising way for scaling up data collection, the related tasks, including simulation task design, task-aware scene generation, expert demonstration synthesis, and sim-to-real transfer, still demand substantial human effort. We present AnyTask, an automated framework that pairs massively parallel GPU simulation with foundation models to design diverse manipulation tasks and synthesize robot data. We introduce three AnyTask agents for generating expert demonstrations aiming to solve as many tasks as possible: 1) ViPR, a novel task and motion planning agent with VLM-in-the-loop Parallel Refinement; 2) ViPR-Eureka, a reinforcement learning agent with generated dense rewards and LLM-guided contact sampling; 3) ViPR-RL, a hybrid planning and learning approach that jointly produces high-quality demonstrations with only sparse rewards. We train behavior cloning policies on generated data, validate them in simulation, and deploy them directly on real robot hardware. The policies generalize to novel object poses, achieving 44% average success across a suite of real-world pick-and-place, drawer opening, contact-rich pushing, and long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dion2简化了Muon优化器的正交化步骤，通过采样减少矩阵规模，提升可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器因正交化步骤的超线性开销在大规模场景下效率下降。

Method: Dion2在每次迭代中采样部分行或列，仅对采样部分进行正交化，使更新稀疏化。

Result: 显著降低计算与通信开销，提高Muon的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Dion2是一种更简单有效的矩阵缩减方法，能更好支持大规模优化。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer enjoys strong empirical performance and theoretical grounding. However, the super-linear cost of its orthonormalization step introduces increasing overhead with scale. To alleviate this cost, several works have attempted to reduce the size of the matrix entering the orthonormalization step. We introduce Dion2, a much simpler method for shrinking the matrix involved in Muon's computation compared to prior approaches. At a high level, Dion2 selects a fraction of rows or columns at each iteration and orthonormalizes only those. This sampling procedure makes the update sparse, reducing both computation and communication costs which in turn improves the scalability of Muon.

Conclusion: 该系统为低收入人群提供了可行、生物直观的假肢控制方案，未来将优化硬件与算法以提升性能。

Abstract: Affordable upper-limb prostheses often lack intuitive control systems, limiting functionality and accessibility for amputees in low-resource settings. This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength. This system demonstrates a feasible pathway to low-cost, biologically intuitive prosthetic control suitable for underserved and global health applications.

Motivation: 探索量子启发方法（PGM与KPGM）在高维特征空间中的分类性能，并与经典方法比较，明确其优势与适用场景。

Method: 基于量子SMOTE变体构建合成数据集，对比PGM（立体/振幅编码）与KPGM分类器的性能，评估准确率与F1分数。

Result: PGM（立体编码，n_copies=2）达到最高准确率0.8512和F1分数0.8234；KPGM表现稳定，振幅编码达0.8483，整体优于随机森林。

Conclusion: 量子启发分类器在召回率与平衡性上具优势：PGM依赖编码优化，KPGM更具鲁棒性，为不同数据场景提供实用选择。

Abstract: Quantum-inspired machine learning (QiML) leverages mathematical frameworks from quantum theory to enhance classical algorithms, with particular emphasis on inner product structures in high-dimensional feature spaces. Among the prominent approaches, the Kernel Trick, widely used in support vector machines, provides efficient similarity computation, while the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM), originating from quantum state discrimination, enables classification grounded in Hilbert space geometry. Building on recent developments in kernelized PGM (KPGM) and direct PGM-based classifiers, this work presents a unified theoretical and empirical comparison of these paradigms. We analyze their performance across synthetic oversampling scenarios using Quantum SMOTE (QSMOTE) variants. Experimental results show that both PGM and KPGM classifiers consistently outperform a classical random forest baseline, particularly when multiple quantum copies are employed. Notably, PGM with stereo encoding and n_copies=2 achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234), while KPGM demonstrates competitive and more stable behavior across QSMOTE variants, with top scores of 0.8511 (stereo) and 0.8483 (amplitude). These findings highlight that quantum-inspired classifiers not only provide tangible gains in recall and balanced performance but also offer complementary strengths: PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements, whereas KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies. Our results advance the understanding of kernel-based and measurement-based QiML methods, offering practical guidance on their applicability under varying data characteristics and computational constraints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM面临上下文长度限制、推理成本高和灾难性遗忘问题，MoE架构依赖显式分类器路由，复杂且不可解释。

Method: 训练87M参数Transformer自编码器，实现序列压缩并利用重建误差作为内在分布指纹，自动调度专家模块。

Result: 在代码域重建准确率达99.47%，维基文本降至47.76%，随机序列仅0.57%，证明重建误差可作为强领域判别信号。

Conclusion: 该架构无需显式门控，具备可扩展性与VRAM压缩潜力，为下一代模块化神经网络提供新方向。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) face three major challenges: context length limitations, high inference costs, and catastrophic forgetting during continual learning. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures mitigate some of these conflicts, their routing mechanisms typically rely on explicitly trained auxiliary classifiers. This not only increases system complexity but also often lacks interpretability when handling mixed-domain inputs.
  Building upon the premise that ``Compression is Intelligence,'' this paper proposes a novel architectural philosophy: \textbf{``Compression is Routing.''} We trained an 87M-parameter end-to-end Transformer Autoencoder, achieving a \textbf{64x sequence length compression} (compressing 512 tokens into 8 latent vectors). Experimental results demonstrate that this compressor possesses extreme domain discriminative capability: it achieves a reconstruction accuracy of \textbf{99.47\%} on the in-domain (code) validation set; accuracy drops sharply to \textbf{47.76\%} on a semi-out-of-distribution domain (Wiki text); and further plummets to just \textbf{0.57\%} on a fully out-of-distribution domain (random sequences).
  This extreme and systematic performance discrepancy establishes the validity of reconstruction error as an \textbf{Intrinsic Distribution Fingerprint}. Based on this, we propose that expert modules can be automatically scheduled using reconstruction residuals directly, without the need for explicit gating networks. This mechanism offers excellent scalability. Furthermore, this architecture provides a new perspective on ``VRAM compression'' for handling ultra-long contexts. This report aims to verify the physical validity of this foundational architecture, offering a new research perspective for the next generation of scalable modular neural networks.

Abstract: Short-term prediction (nowcasting) of low-visibility and precipitation events is critical for aviation safety and operational efficiency. Current operational approaches rely on computationally intensive numerical weather prediction guidance and human-issued TAF products, which often exhibit conservative biases and limited temporal resolution. This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms. Furthermore, SHAP analysis reveals that the model performs an implicit reconstruction of local physical drivers (advection, radiation, and subsidence), providing actionable explainability for operational situational awareness.

Result: 在WebShop和Sokoban数据集上，turn-PPO在有无长程推理组件下均表现更优

Conclusion: turn-PPO通过轮次级建模有效提升了多轮强化学习的稳定性和效率

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has re-emerged as a natural approach for training interactive LLM agents in real-world environments. However, directly applying the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to multi-turn tasks exposes notable limitations, particularly in scenarios requiring long-horizon reasoning. To address these challenges, we investigate more stable and effective advantage estimation strategies, especially for multi-turn settings. We first explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an alternative and find it to be more robust than GRPO. To further enhance PPO in multi-turn scenarios, we introduce turn-PPO, a variant that operates on a turn-level MDP formulation, as opposed to the commonly used token-level MDP. Our results on the WebShop and Sokoban datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of turn-PPO, both with and without long reasoning components.

Conclusion: GB-DQN通过残差 boosting 有效解决非平稳环境下的模型漂移问题，显著提升强化学习的适应能力。

Abstract: Non-stationary environments pose a fundamental challenge for deep reinforcement learning, as changes in dynamics or rewards invalidate learned value functions and cause catastrophic forgetting. We propose \emph{Gradient-Boosted Deep Q-Networks (GB-DQN)}, an adaptive ensemble method that addresses model drift through incremental residual learning. Instead of retraining a single Q-network, GB-DQN constructs an additive ensemble in which each new learner is trained to approximate the Bellman residual of the current ensemble after drift. We provide theoretical results showing that each boosting step reduces the empirical Bellman residual and that the ensemble converges to the post-drift optimal value function under standard assumptions. Experiments across a diverse set of control tasks with controlled dynamics changes demonstrate faster recovery, improved stability, and greater robustness compared to DQN and common non-stationary baselines.

Conclusion: 少量干净样本可显著提升噪声恢复效果，SFBD-OMNI具有强泛化能力，适用于复杂测量模型。

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, obtaining fully observed samples is prohibitively expensive or even infeasible, while partial and noisy observations are comparatively easy to collect. In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable. Building on these insights, we introduce SFBD-OMNI, a bridge model-based framework that maps corrupted sample distributions to the ground-truth distribution. Our method generalizes Stochastic Forward-Backward Deconvolution (SFBD; Lu et al., 2025) to handle arbitrary measurement models beyond Gaussian corruption. Experiments across benchmark datasets and diverse measurement settings demonstrate significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance.

Motivation: 现有检索方法依赖静态输入，无法捕捉多步工具依赖和上下文演化，导致引入无关工具、降低效率与准确率

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上，DTDR相比静态检索器提升函数调用成功率23%-104%

Conclusion: 动态上下文感知的工具检索显著提升代理性能，为轻量级智能代理提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Function calling agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) select external tools to automate complex tasks. On-device agents typically use a retrieval module to select relevant tools, improving performance and reducing context length. However, existing retrieval methods rely on static and limited inputs, failing to capture multi-step tool dependencies and evolving task context. This limitation often introduces irrelevant tools that mislead the agent, degrading efficiency and accuracy. We propose Dynamic Tool Dependency Retrieval (DTDR), a lightweight retrieval method that conditions on both the initial query and the evolving execution context. DTDR models tool dependencies from function calling demonstrations, enabling adaptive retrieval as plans unfold. We benchmark DTDR against state-of-the-art retrieval methods across multiple datasets and LLM backbones, evaluating retrieval precision, downstream task accuracy, and computational efficiency. Additionally, we explore strategies to integrate retrieved tools into prompts. Our results show that dynamic tool retrieval improves function calling success rates between $23\%$ and $104\%$ compared to state-of-the-art static retrievers.

  The equivalence (2)$\iff$(3) was announced by Preiss (1983), while a detailed proof of the implication (3)$\Rightarrow$(2) has appeared in Assouad and Quentin de Gromard (2006). The implication (2)$\Rightarrow$(1) was established by Cérou and Guyader (2006). We prove the implication (1)$\Rightarrow$(3). The result was conjectured in the first article in the series (Collins, Kumari, Pestov 2020), and here we also correct a wrong claim made in the second article (Kumari and Pestov 2024).

TL;DR: 提出一种基于低秩补偿的带宽高效自适应MoE方法，通过路由器引导的精度恢复，在Offloading场景下显著提升带宽与精度的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型在Offloading时因token级路由导致I/O瓶颈，静态量化忽略专家异构性导致精度下降。

Method: 采用路由器引导的低秩补偿器，仅对Top-n专家传输紧凑低秩因子并进行精度补偿，其余专家保持低比特量化。

Result: 在GPU和GPU-NDP系统上实现更优的带宽-精度权衡与更高吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解了MoE推理中的I/O压力，同时保持高精度，适用于内存受限的分布式推理场景。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale capacity via sparse activation but stress memory and bandwidth. Offloading alleviates GPU memory by fetching experts on demand, yet token-level routing causes irregular transfers that make inference I/O-bound. Static uniform quantization reduces traffic but degrades accuracy under aggressive compression by ignoring expert heterogeneity. We present Bandwidth-Efficient Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts via Low-Rank Compensation, which performs router-guided precision restoration using precomputed low-rank compensators. At inference time, our method transfers compact low-rank factors with Top-n (n<k) experts per token and applies compensation to them, keeping others low-bit. Integrated with offloading on GPU and GPU-NDP systems, our method delivers a superior bandwidth-accuracy trade-off and improved throughput.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过在训练中引入含单一错误的推理链，提升大模型对错误的检测与恢复能力，而不牺牲正常解题性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在推理链中一旦出现早期错误便无法纠正，导致最终答案错误，亟需提升其错误恢复能力。

Method: 在MATH-lighteval数据集上生成含单一计算或推理错误的CoT前缀，使用GRPO对Qwen3-4B进行微调，采用二元最终答案奖励。

Result: Mixed-CoT-RL在清洁问题上表现与标准RL相当（41%），但在含错误前缀问题上显著优于标准RL（24% vs 19%）；仅清洁训练反而降低鲁棒性。推理错误训练比计算错误训练效果更好。

Conclusion: 训练中引入有控制的错误推理链，可有效提升模型错误恢复能力，为构建更鲁棒的数学推理模型提供新路径。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has become central to mathematical reasoning in large language models, yet models remain brittle to early errors: a single arithmetic slip or unjustified inference typically propagates uncorrected to an incorrect final answer. We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills. Among error types, training on reasoning errors yields greater robustness gains than calculation errors alone, with mixed training performing best. These findings demonstrate that exposure to flawed traces during training can improve error-recovery behavior without sacrificing accuracy, suggesting a path toward more robust mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: 单位矩阵参数化策略可有效解决平方电路的计算瓶颈，拓展其在概率建模中的实用性。

Abstract: Squared tensor networks (TNs) and their extension as computational graphs--squared circuits--have been used as expressive distribution estimators, yet supporting closed-form marginalization. However, the squaring operation introduces additional complexity when computing the partition function or marginalizing variables, which hinders their applicability in ML. To solve this issue, canonical forms of TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices to simplify the computation of marginals. However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead. Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard. Finally, our experiments on distribution estimation show how our proposed conditions in squared circuits come with no expressiveness loss, while enabling more efficient learning.

Abstract: We propose a new approach for solving planning problems with a hierarchical structure, fusing reinforcement learning and MPC planning. Our formulation tightly and elegantly couples the two planning paradigms. It leverages reinforcement learning actions to inform the MPPI sampler, and adaptively aggregates MPPI samples to inform the value estimation. The resulting adaptive process leverages further MPPI exploration where value estimates are uncertain, and improves training robustness and the overall resulting policies. This results in a robust planning approach that can handle complex planning problems and easily adapts to different applications, as demonstrated over several domains, including race driving, modified Acrobot, and Lunar Lander with added obstacles. Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling.

Conclusion: UniCoMTE通过将模型预测与有意义的信号模式关联，显著提升了深度学习模型在真实时间序列应用中的可解释性。

Abstract: Machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, have demonstrated strong performance in classifying complex time series data. However, their black-box nature limits trust and adoption, especially in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. To address this challenge, we introduce UniCoMTE, a model-agnostic framework for generating counterfactual explanations for multivariate time series classifiers. The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples. Results show that our approach produces concise, stable, and human-aligned explanations that outperform existing methods in both clarity and applicability. By linking model predictions to meaningful signal patterns, the framework advances the interpretability of deep learning models for real-world time series applications.

Result: 在仿真与实测I-V曲线上验证，故障重构误差低于3%，精度高且高效。

Conclusion: 可微物理仿真模型显著提升光伏故障诊断的准确性与实用性。

Abstract: Accurate fault diagnosis and quantification are essential for the reliable operation and intelligent maintenance of photovoltaic (PV) arrays. However, existing fault quantification methods often suffer from limited efficiency and interpretability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel fault quantification approach for PV strings based on a differentiable fast fault simulation model (DFFSM). The proposed DFFSM accurately models I-V characteristics under multiple faults and provides analytical gradients with respect to fault parameters. Leveraging this property, a gradient-based fault parameters identification (GFPI) method using the Adahessian optimizer is developed to efficiently quantify partial shading, short-circuit, and series-resistance degradation. Experimental results on both simulated and measured I-V curves demonstrate that the proposed GFPI achieves high quantification accuracy across different faults, with the I-V reconstruction error below 3%, confirming the feasibility and effectiveness of the application of differentiable physical simulators for PV system fault diagnosis.

Conclusion: Atom为边缘设备提供了一种高效、可扩展的视频-语言理解实用方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in video-language models have enabled powerful applications like video retrieval, captioning, and assembly. However, executing such multi-stage pipelines efficiently on mobile devices remains challenging due to redundant model loads and fragmented execution. We introduce Atom, an on-device system that restructures video-language pipelines for fast and efficient execution. Atom decomposes a billion-parameter model into reusable modules, such as the visual encoder and language decoder, and reuses them across subtasks like captioning, reasoning, and indexing. This reuse-centric design eliminates repeated model loading and enables parallel execution, reducing end-to-end latency without sacrificing performance. On commodity smartphones, Atom achieves 27--33% faster execution compared to non-reuse baselines, with only marginal performance drop ($\leq$ 2.3 Recall@1 in retrieval, $\leq$ 1.5 CIDEr in captioning). These results position Atom as a practical, scalable approach for efficient video-language understanding on edge devices.

Conclusion: 将优化轨迹视为可复用资源，实现无冗余计算与更规范的模型组合。

Abstract: Training large neural networks and merging task-specific models both exploit low-rank structure and require parameter importance estimation, yet these challenges have been pursued in isolation. Current workflows compute curvature information during training, discard it, then recompute similar information for merging -- wasting computation and discarding valuable trajectory data. We introduce a unified framework that maintains factorized momentum and curvature statistics during training, then reuses this information for geometry-aware model composition. The proposed method achieves memory efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while accumulating task saliency scores that enable curvature-aware merging without post-hoc Fisher computation. We establish convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives with approximation error bounded by gradient singular value decay. On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature-aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude-only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving over strong baselines. The proposed framework exhibits rank-invariant convergence and superior hyperparameter robustness compared to existing low-rank optimizers. By treating the optimization trajectory as a reusable asset rather than discarding it, our approach eliminates redundant computation while enabling more principled model composition.

Conclusion: 该研究有助于理解CLIP在医学语境下的局限性，并为提升医疗AI系统在否定语句处理上的可靠性提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large vision-language models like CLIP are increasingly used in medical imaging tasks due to their ability to align images and text without the need for extensive labeled data. This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices.

Conclusion: 该框架为分布式形态发生提供了可微分学习范式，为生物发育机制建模和多智能体形变控制提供了新工具。

Abstract: Biological systems can form complex three-dimensional structures through the collective behavior of identical agents -- cells that follow the same internal rules and communicate without central control. How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于平均的优化器如DiLoCo和Schedule-Free在非分布式场景下存在内存高、超参多或结构复杂等问题，亟需更高效简洁的改进方法。

Method: GPA通过解耦Nesterov原平均公式中的插值常数，实现每步连续迭代平均，摒弃DiLoCo的双层结构，仅增加一个缓冲区。

Result: 在Llama-160M上步数加速24.22%，ImageNet ViT上小/大batch分别加速12%/27%，且理论证明其收敛性不低于原优化器。

Conclusion: GPA在不牺牲收敛性前提下，显著简化结构、降低开销并提升效率，是更优的通用优化框架。

Abstract: We propose Generalized Primal Averaging (GPA), an extension of Nesterov's method in its primal averaging formulation that addresses key limitations of recent averaging-based optimizers such as single-worker DiLoCo and Schedule-Free (SF) in the non-distributed setting. These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload. Furthermore, we prove that for any base optimizer with regret bounded by $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations, GPA can match or exceed the convergence guarantee of the original optimizer, depending on the choice of interpolation constants.

Conclusion: SMILE是首个在随机时变环境中实现全局Gale-Shapley稳定信道分配的分布式学习算法，为认知网络资源管理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We study distributed learning for spectrum access and sharing among multiple cognitive communication entities, such as cells, subnetworks, or cognitive radio users (collectively referred to as cells), in communication-constrained wireless networks modeled by interference graphs. Our goal is to achieve a globally stable and interference-aware channel allocation. Stability is defined through a generalized Gale-Shapley multi-to-one matching, a well-established solution concept in wireless resource allocation. We consider wireless networks where L cells share S orthogonal channels and cannot simultaneously use the same channel as their neighbors. Each channel evolves as an unknown restless Markov process with cell-dependent rewards, making this the first work to establish global Gale-Shapley stability for channel allocation in a stochastic, temporally varying restless environment. To address this challenge, we develop SMILE (Stable Multi-matching with Interference-aware LEarning), a communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm that integrates restless bandit learning with graph-constrained coordination. SMILE enables cells to distributedly balance exploration of unknown channels with exploitation of learned information. We prove that SMILE converges to the optimal stable allocation and achieves logarithmic regret relative to a genie with full knowledge of expected utilities. Simulations validate the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate SMILE's robustness, scalability, and efficiency across diverse spectrum-sharing scenarios.

Conclusion: BumpNet提供了一种通用、高效、可扩展的稀疏神经网络框架，为PDE数值求解和算子学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce BumpNet, a sparse neural network framework for PDE numerical solution and operator learning. BumpNet is based on meshless basis function expansion, in a similar fashion to radial-basis function (RBF) networks. Unlike RBF networks, the basis functions in BumpNet are constructed from ordinary sigmoid activation functions. This enables the efficient use of modern training techniques optimized for such networks. All parameters of the basis functions, including shape, location, and amplitude, are fully trainable. Model parsimony and h-adaptivity are effectively achieved through dynamically pruning basis functions during training. BumpNet is a general framework that can be combined with existing neural architectures for learning PDE solutions: here, we propose Bump-PINNs (BumpNet with physics-informed neural networks) for solving general PDEs; Bump-EDNN (BumpNet with evolutionary deep neural networks) to solve time-evolution PDEs; and Bump-DeepONet (BumpNet with deep operator networks) for PDE operator learning. Bump-PINNs are trained using the same collocation-based approach used by PINNs, Bump-EDNN uses a BumpNet only in the spatial domain and uses EDNNs to advance the solution in time, while Bump-DeepONets employ a BumpNet regression network as the trunk network of a DeepONet. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed architecture.

Abstract: Many scientific and engineering systems exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics that are difficult to predict accurately over long time horizons. Although data-driven models have shown promise, their performance often deteriorates when the geometric structures governing long-term behavior are unknown or poorly represented. We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection. Together, simplicity, geometry awareness, and strong empirical performance point to a promising path for reliable and efficient learning of complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of electric vehicles as a means of addressing climate change, concerns have emerged regarding their impact on electric grid management. As a result, predicting EV charging demand has become a timely and important research problem. While substantial research has addressed energy load forecasting in transportation, relatively few studies systematically compare multiple forecasting methods across different temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels in diverse urban settings. This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods. Forecasting performance is evaluated for short-, mid-, and long-term horizons (on the order of minutes, hours, and days, respectively), and across spatial scales ranging from individual charging stations to regional and city-level aggregations. The analysis is conducted on four publicly available real-world datasets, with results reported independently for each dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically evaluate EV charging demand forecasting across such a wide range of temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels using multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: SHARP-QoS为联合QoS预测提供了统一高效框架，兼顾精度、鲁棒性与可扩展性，适用于真实复杂服务环境。

Abstract: Dependable service-oriented computing relies on multiple Quality of Service (QoS) parameters that are essential to assess service optimality. However, real-world QoS data are extremely sparse, noisy, and shaped by hierarchical dependencies arising from QoS interactions, and geographical and network-level factors, making accurate QoS prediction challenging. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components. First, we introduce a dual mechanism to extract the hierarchical features from both QoS and contextual structures via hyperbolic convolution formulated in the Poincaré ball. Second, we propose an adaptive feature-sharing mechanism that allows feature exchange across informative QoS and contextual signals. A gated feature fusion module is employed to support dynamic feature selection among structural and shared representations. Third, we design an EMA-based loss balancing strategy that allows stable joint optimization, thereby mitigating the negative transfer. Evaluations on three datasets with two, three, and four QoS parameters demonstrate that SHARP-QoS outperforms both single- and multi-task baselines. Extensive study shows that our model effectively addresses major challenges, including sparsity, robustness to outliers, and cold-start, while maintaining moderate computational overhead, underscoring its capability for reliable joint QoS prediction.

Method: 采用SRPL框架，通过预测未来约束违反来优化策略，在Waymo和NuPlan数据集上进行系统实验。

Result: SRPL显著提升成功率（r=0.65-0.86）和降低成本（r=0.70-0.83），对观测噪声更鲁棒，并在跨数据集零样本评估中表现更好。

Conclusion: 预测性安全表征能有效增强自动驾驶安全强化学习的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution. The results further show that predictive safety representations play a critical role in improving robustness to observation noise. Additionally, in zero-shot cross-dataset evaluation, SRPL-augmented agents demonstrate improved generalization compared to non-SRPL methods. These findings collectively demonstrate the potential of predictive safety representations to strengthen SafeRL for autonomous driving.

Motivation: 传统双模拟度量（BSM）仅适用于单个MDP，难以扩展到多个MDP间的状态相似性分析，缺乏严谨的数学性质支撑。

Method: 形式化定义广义双模拟度量（GBSM），并严格证明其对称性、跨MDP三角不等式和同构空间距离界三大性质。

Result: 获得比传统BSM更紧的策略迁移与状态聚合理论界，提出闭式样本复杂度，提升估计效率。

Conclusion: GBSM为多MDP场景下的状态相似性分析提供了坚实理论基础，数值实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The bisimulation metric (BSM) is a powerful tool for analyzing state similarities within a Markov decision process (MDP), revealing that states closer in BSM have more similar optimal value functions. While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to state similarity between multiple MDPs remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to extend BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of well-established mathematical properties has limited further theoretical analysis between MDPs. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) for measuring state similarity between arbitrary pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with three fundamental metric properties, i.e., GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and a distance bound on identical spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyze policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than existing ones derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.

Result: 发现用户偏移风险最高，强化学习是最有效的泛化提升方法。

Conclusion: R-EMID为角色扮演模型泛化分析提供了可解释、理论支撑的评估框架，显著提升模型部署鲁棒性。

Abstract: Role-playing models (RPMs) are widely used in real-world applications but underperform when deployed in the wild. This degradation can be attributed to distribution shifts, including user, character, and dialogue compositional shifts. Existing methods like LLM-as-a-judge fall short in providing a fine-grained diagnosis of how these shifts affect RPM generalization, and thus there lack formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization behaviors. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID. Finally, we evaluate the generalization performance of various RPMs using R-EMID, finding that user shift poses the highest risk among all shifts and reinforcement learning is the most effective approach for enhancing RPM generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法计算卷积积分代价高，现有神经求解器无法泛化到多样化的非局部结构。

Method: MINPO使用KAN或MLP编码器直接学习非局部算子及其逆，结合轻量级非局部一致性损失，重建未知解场。

Conclusion: MINPO提供了一个统一框架，可有效处理广泛类型的非局部动力学系统，包括分数阶PDEs。

Abstract: Many physical systems exhibit nonlocal spatiotemporal behaviors described by integro-differential equations (IDEs). Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals. MINPO, thus, generalizes beyond problem-specific formulations, providing a unified framework for systems governed by nonlocal operators.

Conclusion: 该框架证明了 principled 半监督学习能有效利用大规模部分标注神经影像数据，大幅降低标注负担并保持临床可用的精度。

Abstract: Machine learning approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis face a fundamental challenges. Clinical assessments are expensive and invasive, leaving ground truth labels available for only a fraction of neuroimaging datasets. We introduce Multi view Adaptive Transport Clustering for Heterogeneous Alzheimer's Disease (MATCH-AD), a semi supervised framework that integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to address this limitation. The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability. These results demonstrate that principled semi-supervised learning can unlock the diagnostic potential of the vast repositories of partially annotated neuroimaging data accumulating worldwide, substantially reducing annotation burden while maintaining accuracy suitable for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Continual learning on edge platforms remains challenging because recurrent networks depend on energy-intensive training procedures and frequent data movement that are impractical for embedded deployments. This work introduces M2RU, a mixed-signal architecture that implements the minion recurrent unit for efficient temporal processing with on-chip continual learning. The architecture integrates weighted-bit streaming, which enables multi-bit digital inputs to be processed in crossbars without high-resolution conversion, and an experience replay mechanism that stabilizes learning under domain shifts. M2RU achieves 15 GOPS at 48.62 mW, corresponding to 312 GOPS per watt, and maintains accuracy within 5 percent of software baselines on sequential MNIST and CIFAR-10 tasks. Compared with a CMOS digital design, the accelerator provides 29X improvement in energy efficiency. Device-aware analysis shows an expected operational lifetime of 12.2 years under continual learning workloads. These results establish M2RU as a scalable and energy-efficient platform for real-time adaptation in edge-level temporal intelligence.

Abstract: Inherent explainability is the gold standard in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). However, there is not a consistent definition or test to demonstrate inherent explainability. Work to date either characterises explainability through metrics, or appeals to intuition - "we know it when we see it". We propose a globally applicable criterion for inherent explainability. The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand. It follows that PREDICT is inherently explainable. This work provides structure to formalise other work on explainability, and allows regulators a flexible but rigorous test that can be used in compliance frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释在上下文学习（ICL）中为何某些任务能成功而另一些失败，挑战将ICL视为单一机制的现有观点。

Method: 通过激活修补实验，在9个模型、7种Transformer架构及Mamba上分析任务模式与绑定的神经机制。

Result: 发现双重分离：任务模式100%可迁移，绑定62%可迁移；前知识与任务模式依赖呈负相关（rho=-0.596）；该机制在所有架构中通用。

Conclusion: ICL是双过程机制，任务模式在无先验时主导，先验知识通过注意力误路由干扰绑定，而非输出竞争，为提示工程提供优化路径。

Abstract: We provide causal mechanistic validation that in-context learning (ICL) decomposes into two separable mechanisms: Task Schema (abstract task type recognition) and Binding (specific input-output associations). Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:
  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms
  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)
  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba
  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.

Conclusion: 自适应剪枝可在不牺牲突发事件响应能力的前提下有效减少边缘部署的通信开销，验证了通信效率与预测性能的平衡可能性。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) are well-suited for processing high-frequency data streams from geographically distributed sensors in smart mobility systems. However, their deployment at the edge across distributed compute nodes (cloudlets) createssubstantial communication overhead due to repeated transmission of overlapping node features between neighbouring cloudlets. To address this, we propose an adaptive pruning algorithm that dynamically filters redundant neighbour features while preserving the most informative spatial context for prediction. The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce the Sudden Event Prediction Accuracy (SEPA), a novel event-focused metric designed to measure responsiveness to traffic slowdowns and recoveries, which are often missed by standard error metrics. We evaluate our approach in an online semi-decentralized setting with traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning on two large-scale traffic datasets, PeMS-BAY and PeMSD7-M, across short-, mid-, and long-term prediction horizons. Experiments show that, in contrast to standard metrics, SEPA exposes the true value of spatial connectivity in predicting dynamic and irregular traffic. Our adaptive pruning algorithm maintains prediction accuracy while significantly lowering communication cost in all online semi-decentralized settings, demonstrating that communication can be reduced without compromising responsiveness to critical traffic events.

Abstract: Social media platforms are plagued by harmful content such as hate speech, misinformation, and extremist rhetoric. Machine learning (ML) models are widely adopted to detect such content; however, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, wherein malicious users subtly modify text to evade detection. Enhancing adversarial robustness is therefore essential, requiring detectors that can defend against diverse attacks (generalizability) while maintaining high overall accuracy. However, simultaneously achieving both optimal generalizability and accuracy is challenging. Following the computational design science paradigm, this study takes a sequential approach that first proposes a novel framework (Large Language Model-based Sample Generation and Aggregation, LLM-SGA) by identifying the key invariances of textual adversarial attacks and leveraging them to ensure that a detector instantiated within the framework has strong generalizability. Second, we instantiate our detector (Adversarially Robust Harmful Online Content Detector, ARHOCD) with three novel design components to improve detection accuracy: (1) an ensemble of multiple base detectors that exploits their complementary strengths; (2) a novel weight assignment method that dynamically adjusts weights based on each sample's predictability and each base detector's capability, with weights initialized using domain knowledge and updated via Bayesian inference; and (3) a novel adversarial training strategy that iteratively optimizes both the base detectors and the weight assignor. We addressed several limitations of existing adversarial robustness enhancement research and empirically evaluated ARHOCD across three datasets spanning hate speech, rumor, and extremist content. Results show that ARHOCD offers strong generalizability and improves detection accuracy under adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: 判别模型存在可利用的系统性漏洞，需通过对抗训练增强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reward models and LLM-as-a-Judge systems are central to modern post-training pipelines such as RLHF, DPO, and RLAIF, where they provide scalar feedback and binary decisions that guide model selection and RL-based fine-tuning. We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality.

Abstract: Private Inference (PI) uses cryptographic primitives to perform privacy preserving machine learning. In this setting, the owner of the network runs inference on the data of the client without learning anything about the data and without revealing any information about the model. It has been observed that a major computational bottleneck of PI is the calculation of the gate (i.e., ReLU), so a considerable amount of effort have been devoted to reducing the number of ReLUs in a given network.
  We focus on the DReLU, which is the non-linear step function of the ReLU and show that one DReLU can serve many ReLU operations. We suggest a new activation module where the DReLU operation is only performed on a subset of the channels (Prototype channels), while the rest of the channels (replicate channels) replicates the DReLU of each of their neurons from the corresponding neurons in one of the prototype channels. We then extend this idea to work across different layers.
  We show that this formulation can drastically reduce the number of DReLU operations in resnet type network. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that this new formulation can solve an extended version of the XOR problem, using just one non-linearity and two neurons, something that traditional formulations and some PI specific methods cannot achieve. We achieve new SOTA results on several classification setups, and achieve SOTA results on image segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理不同样本量和基线率的亚组时缺乏统计严谨性，难以识别真实性能差异。

Conclusion: 该工具箱为医学影像模型的公平性评估提供了可操作、严谨的统计框架。

Abstract: Analyzing machine learning model performance stratified by patient and recording properties is becoming the accepted norm and often yields crucial insights about important model failure modes. Performing such analyses in a statistically rigorous manner is non-trivial, however. Appropriate performance metrics must be selected that allow for valid comparisons between groups of different sample sizes and base rates; metric uncertainty must be determined and multiple comparisons be corrected for, in order to assess whether any observed differences may be purely due to chance; and in the case of intersectional analyses, mechanisms must be implemented to find the most `interesting' subgroups within combinatorially many subgroup combinations. We here present a statistical toolbox that addresses these challenges and enables practitioners to easily yet rigorously assess their models for potential subgroup performance disparities. While broadly applicable, the toolbox is specifically designed for medical imaging applications. The analyses provided by the toolbox are illustrated in two case studies, one in skin lesion malignancy classification on the ISIC2020 dataset and one in chest X-ray-based disease classification on the MIMIC-CXR dataset.

Abstract: Electricity systems are key to transforming today's society into a carbon-free economy. Long-term electricity market mechanisms, including auctions, support schemes, and other policy instruments, are critical in shaping the electricity generation mix. In light of the need for more advanced tools to support policymakers and other stakeholders in designing, testing, and evaluating long-term markets, this work presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning model capable of capturing the key features of decarbonizing energy systems. Profit-maximizing generation companies make investment decisions in the wholesale electricity market, responding to system needs, competitive dynamics, and policy signals. The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility. The proposed framework allows assessing long-term electricity markets in which multiple policy and market mechanisms interact simultaneously, with market participants responding and adapting to decarbonization pathways.

Motivation: 现有方法仅在KV缓存写入后进行选择或淘汰，忽略了低效的无差别写入问题。

Method: 提出Write-Gated KV机制，通过预测token效用，在写入缓存前过滤低效项，结合全局与局部滑动缓存管理。

Result: 内存减少46-57%，预填充加速3.03-3.45倍，解码加速1.89-2.56倍，精度损失可忽略，兼容FlashAttention和paged-KV。

Conclusion: 学习写入内容是高效长上下文推理的原理性且实用的方案。

Abstract: Long-context LLM inference is bottlenecked by the quadratic attention complexity and linear KV cache growth. Prior approaches mitigate this via post-hoc selection or eviction but overlook the root inefficiency: indiscriminate writing to persistent memory. In this paper, we formalize KV cache management as a causal system of three primitives: KV Admission, Selection, and Eviction. We instantiate KV Admission via Write-Gated KV, a lightweight mechanism that learns to predict token utility before it enters the cache. By filtering out low-utility states early to maintain a compact global cache alongside a sliding local cache, Write-Gated KV reduces memory usage by 46-57% and delivers 3.03-3.45$\times$ prefill and 1.89-2.56$\times$ decode speedups on Llama model with negligible accuracy loss, all while remaining compatible with FlashAttention and paged-KV systems. These results demonstrate that learning what to write, is a principled and practical recipe for efficient long-context inference. Code is available at https://github.com/EMCLab-Sinica/WG-KV .

Method: 结合趋势-季节性分解的时序模块与低秩Top-K邻接学习和保守时序门控的空间模块，构建轻量级时空图网络。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上达到SOTA精度（预测步长达720），训练速度远超Transformer，且参数效率高；空间模块提升4.6%，Top-K增强局部性3.3%。

Conclusion: Lite-STGNN是一个紧凑、可解释、高效的长期多变量时间序列预测框架，兼顾性能与计算效率。

Abstract: We propose Lite-STGNN, a lightweight spatial-temporal graph neural network for long-term multivariate forecasting that integrates decomposition-based temporal modeling with learnable sparse graph structure. The temporal module applies trend-seasonal decomposition, while the spatial module performs message passing with low-rank Top-$K$ adjacency learning and conservative horizon-wise gating, enabling spatial corrections that enhance a strong linear baseline. Lite-STGNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on four benchmark datasets for horizons up to 720 steps, while being parameter-efficient and substantially faster to train than transformer-based methods. Ablation studies show that the spatial module yields 4.6% improvement over the temporal baseline, Top-$K$ enhances locality by 3.3%, and learned adjacency matrices reveal domain-specific interaction dynamics. Lite-STGNN thus offers a compact, interpretable, and efficient framework for long-term multivariate time series forecasting.

Motivation: 传统有限元蠕变仿真（如ANSYS）计算昂贵，单次模拟需数十分钟，难以满足设计优化与健康监测的实时需求。

Method: 基于BiLSTM-VAE和BiLSTM-Transformer的深度学习代理模型，利用ANSYS生成的蠕变应变数据（50–150 MPa, 700–1000°C）进行训练，前者提供概率预测，后者实现高精度确定性预测。

Conclusion: 所提框架显著提升蠕变评估效率，为高温合金结构设计与实时监测提供可扩展的快速解决方案。

Abstract: Time-dependent deformation, particularly creep, in high-temperature alloys such as Inconel 625 is a key factor in the long-term reliability of components used in aerospace and energy systems. Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds. The proposed framework enables rapid creep assessment for design optimization and structural health monitoring, and provides a scalable solution for high-temperature alloy applications.

Motivation: 现有蛋白设计基础模型带来生物安全风险，但缺乏可复现、同源性控制且能在普通CPU上运行的序列级危险筛查基线。

Method: 构建仅使用元数据的基准SafeBench-Seq，基于SafeProtein危险数据和UniProt良性数据，采用全局理化特征与氨基酸组成，通过≤40%同源性聚类进行聚类级留出评估，并使用校准分类器计算概率质量指标。

Result: 同源性聚类评估比随机分割更严格；线性模型校准效果好，树模型性能略优但校准较差；模型在AUROC/AUPRC及筛查操作点上表现稳定，置信区间明确。

Conclusion: SafeBench-Seq为蛋白安全筛查提供了可复现、无风险、低资源需求的标准化评估框架，推动社区安全研究。

Abstract: Foundation models for protein design raise concrete biosecurity risks, yet the community lacks a simple, reproducible baseline for sequence-level hazard screening that is explicitly evaluated under homology control and runs on commodity CPUs. We introduce SafeBench-Seq, a metadata-only, reproducible benchmark and baseline classifier built entirely from public data (SafeProtein hazards and UniProt benigns) and interpretable features (global physicochemical descriptors and amino-acid composition). To approximate "never-before-seen" threats, we homology-cluster the combined dataset at <=40% identity and perform cluster-level holdouts (no cluster overlap between train/test). We report discrimination (AUROC/AUPRC) and screening-operating points (TPR@1% FPR; FPR@95% TPR) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (n=200), and we provide calibrated probabilities via CalibratedClassifierCV (isotonic for Logistic Regression / Random Forest; Platt sigmoid for Linear SVM). We quantify probability quality using Brier score, Expected Calibration Error (ECE; 15 bins), and reliability diagrams. Shortcut susceptibility is probed via composition-preserving residue shuffles and length-/composition-only ablations. Empirically, random splits substantially overestimate robustness relative to homology-clustered evaluation; calibrated linear models exhibit comparatively good calibration, while tree ensembles retain slightly higher Brier/ECE. SafeBench-Seq is CPU-only, reproducible, and releases metadata only (accessions, cluster IDs, split labels), enabling rigorous evaluation without distributing hazardous sequences.

Method: 引入固定协作（F-CFF）和自适应协作（A-CFF）两种机制，构建跨层加权的协作 goodness 函数，保持前向计算与生物合理性

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST上显著优于基线前向传播算法

Conclusion: 层间协作是前向传播学习的关键改进，适用于神经形态计算与低功耗AI系统

Abstract: The Forward-Forward algorithm eliminates backpropagation's memory constraints and biological implausibility through dual forward passes with positive and negative data. However, conventional implementations suffer from critical inter-layer isolation, where layers optimize goodness functions independently without leveraging collective learning dynamics. This isolation constrains representational coordination and limits convergence efficiency in deeper architectures. This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility. Comprehensive evaluation on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline Forward-Forward implementations. These findings establish inter-layer collaboration as a fundamental enhancement to Forward-Forward learning, with immediate applicability to neuromorphic computing architectures and energy-constrained AI systems.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation has proven to be a powerful tool for expensive global black-box optimisation problems. In this paper, we propose new Bayesian optimisation variants of the popular Knowledge Gradient acquisition functions for problems with \emph{decoupled} black-box constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. In particular, our methods aim to take into account that often only a handful of the constraints may be binding at the optimum, and hence we should evaluate only relevant constraints when trying to optimise a function. We empirically benchmark these methods against existing methods and demonstrate their superiority over the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: GreedySnake有效缓解I/O瓶颈，为大模型低成本训练提供高效解决方案，代码已开源

Abstract: SSD-offloaded training offers a practical and promising approach to making LLM training cost-effective. Building on gradient accumulation with micro-batches, this paper introduces GreedySnake, a new SSD-offloaded training system that employs vertical scheduling, which executes all microbatches of a layer before proceeding to the next. Compared to existing systems that use horizontal scheduling (i.e., executing micro-batches sequentially), GreedySnake achieves higher training throughput with smaller batch sizes, bringing the system much closer to the ideal scenario predicted by the roofline model. To further mitigate the I/O bottleneck, GreedySnake overlaps part of the optimization step with the forward pass of the next iteration. Experimental results on A100 GPUs show that GreedySnake achieves saturated training throughput improvements over ZeRO-Infinity: 1.96x on 1 GPU and 1.93x on 4 GPUs for GPT-65B, and 2.53x on 1 GPU for GPT-175B.

Abstract: The primary objective of this thesis is to develop novel algorithmic approaches for Graph Representation Learning of static and single-event dynamic networks. In such a direction, we focus on the family of Latent Space Models, and more specifically on the Latent Distance Model which naturally conveys important network characteristics such as homophily, transitivity, and the balance theory. Furthermore, this thesis aims to create structural-aware network representations, which lead to hierarchical expressions of network structure, community characterization, the identification of extreme profiles in networks, and impact dynamics quantification in temporal networks. Crucially, the methods presented are designed to define unified learning processes, eliminating the need for heuristics and multi-stage processes like post-processing steps. Our aim is to delve into a journey towards unified network embeddings that are both comprehensive and powerful, capable of characterizing network structures and adeptly handling the diverse tasks that graph analysis offers.

Conclusion: 异步协作结合拼接技术可有效实现跨机构模型协作，无需数据共享即可获得竞争力结果。

Abstract: Deep learning has been shown to be very capable at performing many real-world tasks. However, this performance is often dependent on the presence of large and varied datasets. In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.
  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results.

Abstract: In this paper we consider the limiting case of neural networks (NNs) architectures when the number of neurons in each hidden layer and the number of hidden layers tend to infinity thus forming a continuum, and we derive approximation errors as a function of the number of neurons and/or hidden layers. Firstly, we consider the case of neural networks with a single hidden layer and we derive an integral infinite width neural representation that generalizes existing continuous neural networks (CNNs) representations. Then we extend this to deep residual CNNs that have a finite number of integral hidden layers and residual connections. Secondly, we revisit the relation between neural ODEs and deep residual NNs and we formalize approximation errors via discretization techniques. Then, we merge these two approaches into a unified homogeneous representation of NNs as a Distributed Parameter neural Network (DiPaNet) and we show that most of the existing finite and infinite-dimensional NNs architectures are related via homogeneization/discretization with the DiPaNet representation. Our approach is purely deterministic and applies to general, uniformly continuous matrix weight functions. Differences and similarities with neural fields are discussed along with further possible generalizations and applications of the DiPaNet framework.

Abstract: Algorithms increasingly operate within complex physical, social, and engineering systems where they are exposed to disturbances, noise, and interconnections with other dynamical systems. This article extends known convergence guarantees of an algorithm operating in isolation (i.e., without disturbances) and systematically derives stability bounds and convergence rates in the presence of such disturbances. By leveraging converse Lyapunov theorems, we derive key inequalities that quantify the impact of disturbances. We further demonstrate how our result can be utilized to assess the effects of disturbances on algorithmic performance in a wide variety of applications, including communication constraints in distributed learning, sensitivity in machine learning generalization, and intentional noise injection for privacy. This underpins the role of our result as a unifying tool for algorithm analysis in the presence of noise, disturbances, and interconnections with other dynamical systems.

Conclusion: 混合训练策略提升了PINNs的性能与可靠性，为未来训练设计提供新思路

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a prominent paradigm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their training strategies remain underexplored. While hard prioritization methods inspired by finite element methods are widely adopted, recent research suggests that easy prioritization can also be effective. Nevertheless, we find that both approaches exhibit notable trade-offs and inconsistent performance across PDE types. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid strategy that combines the strengths of hard and easy prioritization through an alternating training algorithm. On PDEs with steep gradients, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality, the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy, with relative L2 errors mostly in the range of O(10^-5) to O(10^-6), significantly surpassing baseline methods. Moreover, it offers greater reliability across diverse problems, whereas compared approaches often suffer from variable accuracy depending on the PDE. This work provides new insights into designing hybrid training strategies to enhance the performance and robustness of PINNs.

Conclusion: SCOPE为序列化规范过程监控提供了更准确、高效的解决方案，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) recommends interventions during business processes to optimize key performance indicators (KPIs). In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI. The novel semi-synthetic setup, based on a real-life event log, is provided as a reusable benchmark for future work on sequential PresPM.

However, the dominant two-stage pipeline (SFT then RL) suffers from a key inconsistency: SFT enforces rigid imitation that suppresses exploration and induces forgetting, limiting RL's potential for improvements. We address this inefficiency with TRAPO (\textbf{T}rust-\textbf{R}egion \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a hybrid framework that interleaves SFT and RL within each training instance by optimizing SFT loss on expert prefixes and RL loss on the model's own completions, unifying external supervision and self-exploration. To stabilize training, we introduce Trust-Region SFT (TrSFT), which minimizes forward KL divergence inside a trust region but attenuates optimization outside, effectively shifting toward reverse KL and yielding stable, mode-seeking updates favorable for RL. An adaptive prefix-selection mechanism further allocates expert guidance based on measured utility. Experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that TRAPO consistently surpasses standard SFT, RL, and SFT-then-RL pipelines, as well as recent state-of-the-art approaches, establishing a strong new paradigm for reasoning-enhanced LLMs.

Conclusion: 该架构为深度学习提供了一种理论严谨、计算高效、可扩展的替代方案，突破了传统梯度方法的局限。

Abstract: This paper presents a deep machine learning architecture, the "polyharmonic cascade" -- a sequence of packages of polyharmonic splines, where each layer is rigorously derived from the theory of random functions and the principles of indifference. This makes it possible to approximate nonlinear functions of arbitrary complexity while preserving global smoothness and a probabilistic interpretation. For the polyharmonic cascade, a training method alternative to gradient descent is proposed: instead of directly optimizing the coefficients, one solves a single global linear system on each batch with respect to the function values at fixed "constellations" of nodes. This yields synchronized updates of all layers, preserves the probabilistic interpretation of individual layers and theoretical consistency with the original model, and scales well: all computations reduce to 2D matrix operations efficiently executed on a GPU. Fast learning without overfitting on MNIST is demonstrated.

Abstract: Selecting compact and informative gene subsets from single-cell transcriptomic data is essential for biomarker discovery, improving interpretability, and cost-effective profiling. However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers. Through a multi-task learning design, the model learns shared representations across related objectives, allowing partially labeled datasets to inform one another, and discovering gene subsets that generalize across tasks without additional training steps. We evaluate YOTO on two representative single-cell RNA-seq datasets, showing that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These results demonstrate that sparse, end-to-end, multi-task gene subset selection improves predictive performance and yields compact and meaningful gene subsets, advancing biomarker discovery and single-cell analysis.

Abstract: We present a novel theoretical analysis of Federated SARSA (FedSARSA) with linear function approximation and local training. We establish convergence guarantees for FedSARSA in the presence of heterogeneity, both in local transitions and rewards, providing the first sample and communication complexity bounds in this setting. At the core of our analysis is a new, exact multi-step error expansion for single-agent SARSA, which is of independent interest. Our analysis precisely quantifies the impact of heterogeneity, demonstrating the convergence of FedSARSA with multiple local updates. Crucially, we show that FedSARSA achieves linear speed-up with respect to the number of agents, up to higher-order terms due to Markovian sampling. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: 该方法有效融合物理先验与数据驱动学习，实现高精度与可靠不确定性估计的统一。

Abstract: The modeling of high-dimensional spatio-temporal processes presents a fundamental dichotomy between the probabilistic rigor of classical geostatistics and the flexible, high-capacity representations of deep learning. While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.

Conclusion: LaLoRA是一种轻量级、有效的方法，能在保持高效微调的同时增强知识保留能力，且对近似方法、数据和超参数具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enable fast specialization of large pre-trained models to different downstream applications. However, this process often leads to catastrophic forgetting of the model's prior domain knowledge. We address this issue with LaLoRA, a weight-space regularization technique that applies a Laplace approximation to Low-Rank Adaptation. Our approach estimates the model's confidence in each parameter and constrains updates in high-curvature directions, preserving prior knowledge while enabling efficient target-domain learning. By applying the Laplace approximation only to the LoRA weights, the method remains lightweight. We evaluate LaLoRA by fine-tuning a Llama model for mathematical reasoning and demonstrate an improved learning-forgetting trade-off, which can be directly controlled via the method's regularization strength. We further explore different loss landscape curvature approximations for estimating parameter confidence, analyze the effect of the data used for the Laplace approximation, and study robustness across hyperparameters.

Abstract: Effectively capturing long-range interactions remains a fundamental yet unresolved challenge in graph neural network (GNN) research, critical for applications across diverse fields of science. To systematically address this, we introduce ECHO (Evaluating Communication over long HOps), a novel benchmark specifically designed to rigorously assess the capabilities of GNNs in handling very long-range graph propagation. ECHO includes three synthetic graph tasks, namely single-source shortest paths, node eccentricity, and graph diameter, each constructed over diverse and structurally challenging topologies intentionally designed to introduce significant information bottlenecks. ECHO also includes two real-world datasets, ECHO-Charge and ECHO-Energy, which define chemically grounded benchmarks for predicting atomic partial charges and molecular total energies, respectively, with reference computations obtained at the density functional theory (DFT) level. Both tasks inherently depend on capturing complex long-range molecular interactions. Our extensive benchmarking of popular GNN architectures reveals clear performance gaps, emphasizing the difficulty of true long-range propagation and highlighting design choices capable of overcoming inherent limitations. ECHO thereby sets a new standard for evaluating long-range information propagation, also providing a compelling example for its need in AI for science.

Conclusion: Easy Adaptation是一种高效、低成本的替代方案，适合资源受限和闭源大模型场景。

Abstract: While the enormous parameter scale endows Large Models (LMs) with unparalleled performance, it also limits their adaptability across specific tasks. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources.

Result: 理论证明CDL具有下界与正则化性质，实验表明其在基准和真实数据集上显著提升分类与校准性能

Conclusion: CDL可无缝集成至现有MIPL/PLL框架，是更优的消歧损失方案

Abstract: Multi-instance partial-label learning (MIPL) is a weakly supervised framework that extends the principles of multi-instance learning (MIL) and partial-label learning (PLL) to address the challenges of inexact supervision in both instance and label spaces. However, existing MIPL approaches often suffer from poor calibration, undermining classifier reliability. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play calibratable disambiguation loss (CDL) that simultaneously improves classification accuracy and calibration performance. The loss has two instantiations: the first one calibrates predictions based on probabilities from the candidate label set, while the second one integrates probabilities from both candidate and non-candidate label sets. The proposed CDL can be seamlessly incorporated into existing MIPL and PLL frameworks. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes the lower bound and regularization properties of CDL, demonstrating its superiority over conventional disambiguation losses. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets confirm that our CDL significantly enhances both classification and calibration performance.

Result: 所提方法在不使用复杂架构的情况下，性能优于多个竞争基线

Conclusion: ID和文本特征均不可或缺，但无需复杂融合机制即可实现最优性能

Abstract: Modern Sequential Recommendation (SR) models commonly utilize modality features to represent items, motivated in large part by recent advancements in language and vision modeling. To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models. We show that these models do learn complementary signals, meaning that either should provide performance gain when used properly alongside the other. Motivated by this, we propose a new SR method that preserves ID-text complementarity through independent model training, then harnesses it through a simple ensembling strategy. Despite this method's simplicity, we show it outperforms several competitive SR baselines, implying that both ID and text features are necessary to achieve state-of-the-art SR performance but complex fusion architectures are not.

Conclusion: WFR框架为非log-concave分布的高效采样提供了新范式，具有广阔发展潜力。

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models currently constitute the state of the art in continuous generative modeling. These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.
  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation. Our study provides a preliminary but rigorous investigation of WFR-based sampling dynamics, and aims to clarify their geometric and operator-theoretic structure as a foundation for future theoretical and algorithmic developments.

Abstract: Operator learning is a data-driven approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, such as the solution operators of partial differential equations. Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests.
