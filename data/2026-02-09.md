TL;DR: SuperHead通过结合预训练3D生成模型和动态感知3D反演，提升低分辨率可动画3D头像的细节与一致性，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低质量图像或视频导致3D重建效果差，现有超分辨率技术无法有效处理动态3D输入。

Method: 利用预训练3D生成模型，通过动态感知3D反演优化潜在表示，生成高分辨率3D高斯泼溅头像，并绑定FLAME参数化模型实现动画，联合监督使用多视角、多表情的上采样2D渲染与深度图。

Result: 生成的头像在动态表情下具有精细面部细节，视觉质量显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: SuperHead为低质输入提供了高质量、高一致性的可动画3D头像生成新范式。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D talking heads is crucial for immersive applications, yet often hindered by the prevalence of low-quality image or video sources, which yield poor 3D reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce SuperHead, a novel framework for enhancing low-resolution, animatable 3D head avatars. The core challenge lies in synthesizing high-quality geometry and textures, while ensuring both 3D and temporal consistency during animation and preserving subject identity. Despite recent progress in image, video and 3D-based super-resolution (SR), existing SR techniques are ill-equipped to handle dynamic 3D inputs. To address this, SuperHead leverages the rich priors from pre-trained 3D generative models via a novel dynamics-aware 3D inversion scheme. This process optimizes the latent representation of the generative model to produce a super-resolved 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) head model, which is subsequently rigged to an underlying parametric head model (e.g., FLAME) for animation. The inversion is jointly supervised using a sparse collection of upscaled 2D face renderings and corresponding depth maps, captured from diverse facial expressions and camera viewpoints, to ensure realism under dynamic facial motions. Experiments demonstrate that SuperHead generates avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, significantly outperforming baseline methods in visual quality.

### [2] [EgoAVU: Egocentric Audio-Visual Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06139)
*Ashish Seth,Xinhao Mei,Changsheng Zhao,Varun Nagaraja,Ernie Chang,Gregory P. Meyer,Gael Le Lan,Yunyang Xiong,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi,Dinesh Manocha,Zhipeng Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EgoAVU数据引擎，自动生成头戴式视频的音视觉描述与问答，显著提升多模态大模型对音频-视觉联合理解的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大模型在头戴式视频中难以联合理解音视频模态，因缺乏带一致跨模态标签的文本数据。

Method: EgoAVU通过跨模态关联建模生成音视觉叙述，结合基于令牌的视频过滤与图结构数据筛选，构建300万样本的EgoAVU-Instruct训练集与人工验证的EgoAVU-Bench评测集。

Result: 在EgoAVU-Bench上，微调后模型性能提升达113%，并在EgoTempo和EgoIllusion等基准上实现最高28%的相对增益。

Conclusion: EgoAVU有效解决音视频联合理解难题，推动多模态大模型在具身智能中的应用。

Abstract: Understanding egocentric videos plays a vital role for embodied intelligence. Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can accept both visual and audio inputs. However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, a scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audio-visual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph-based curation ensure both data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct, a large-scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench, a manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily toward visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively addresses this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefits also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain. Code will be released to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂真实场景中的单视图3D重建面临噪声、物体多样性和数据集稀缺等挑战。

Method: 引入MGP-KAD框架，通过采样与聚类生成类级几何先验，并结合基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络的混合解码器融合多模态特征。

Result: 在Pix3D数据集上达到SOTA性能，显著提升几何完整性、平滑性与细节保留。

Conclusion: MGP-KAD为复杂场景下的单视图3D重建提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Single-view 3D reconstruction in complex real-world scenes is challenging due to noise, object diversity, and limited dataset availability. To address these challenges, we propose MGP-KAD, a novel multimodal feature fusion framework that integrates RGB and geometric prior to enhance reconstruction accuracy. The geometric prior is generated by sampling and clustering ground-truth object data, producing class-level features that dynamically adjust during training to improve geometric understanding. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid decoder based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to overcome the limitations of traditional linear decoders in processing complex multimodal inputs. Extensive experiments on the Pix3D dataset demonstrate that MGP-KAD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly improving geometric integrity, smoothness, and detail preservation. Our work provides a robust and effective solution for advancing single-view 3D reconstruction in complex scenes.

### [4] [Driving with DINO: Vision Foundation Features as a Unified Bridge for Sim-to-Real Generation in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06159)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Driving with DINO (DwD)，利用DINOv3特征统一模拟与真实域，通过主子空间投影和随机通道尾部丢弃平衡控制一致性与真实感，并引入空间对齐与因果时序聚合提升精度与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Sim2Real方法在控制一致性与真实感之间存在根本性权衡：低层信号保控制但失真，高层先验保真实但缺细节。

Method: 使用DINOv3特征作为统一桥梁，结合主子空间投影去除纹理伪影、随机通道尾部丢弃保留结构、可学习空间对齐模块适配高分辨率特征、因果时序聚合保持运动上下文。

Result: 有效缓解纹理烘焙、运动模糊，提升生成视频的真实性与时间稳定性，同时保持精确控制。

Conclusion: DwD通过融合视觉基础模型特征与精心设计的特征处理机制，成功解决Sim2Real中的一致性-真实感困境。

Abstract: Driven by the emergence of Controllable Video Diffusion, existing Sim2Real methods for autonomous driving video generation typically rely on explicit intermediate representations to bridge the domain gap. However, these modalities face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma. Low-level signals (e.g., edges, blurred images) ensure precise control but compromise realism by "baking in" synthetic artifacts, whereas high-level priors (e.g., depth, semantics, HDMaps) facilitate photorealism but lack the structural detail required for consistent guidance. In this work, we present Driving with DINO (DwD), a novel framework that leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features as a unified bridge between the simulation and real-world domains. We first identify that these features encode a spectrum of information, from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. To effectively utilize this, we employ Principal Subspace Projection to discard the high-frequency elements responsible for "texture baking," while concurrently introducing Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate the structural loss inherent in rigid dimensionality reduction, thereby reconciling realism with control consistency. Furthermore, to fully leverage DINOv3's high-resolution capabilities for enhancing control precision, we introduce a learnable Spatial Alignment Module that adapts these high-resolution features to the diffusion backbone. Finally, we propose a Causal Temporal Aggregator employing causal convolutions to explicitly preserve historical motion context when integrating frame-wise DINO features, which effectively mitigates motion blur and guarantees temporal stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式SDF方法依赖大量标注数据，限制了可扩展性，亟需利用无标签数据提升性能。

Method: 引入基于梯度的参数重要性估计以正则化自适应EMA更新，并结合SDF方差与增强一致性设计SDF感知的伪标签加权机制，联合优化标注与无标签数据。

Result: 在Pix3D基准上，Chamfer Distance降低20.61%，IoU提升24.09%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: MetaSSP有效利用无标签数据，显著提升半监督3D重建性能，为大规模应用提供新路径。

Abstract: Implicit SDF-based methods for single-view 3D reconstruction achieve high-quality surfaces but require large labeled datasets, limiting their scalability. We propose MetaSSP, a novel semi-supervised framework that exploits abundant unlabeled images. Our approach introduces gradient-based parameter importance estimation to regularize adaptive EMA updates and an SDF-aware pseudo-label weighting mechanism combining augmentation consistency with SDF variance. Beginning with a 10% supervised warm-up, the unified pipeline jointly refines labeled and unlabeled data. On the Pix3D benchmark, our method reduces Chamfer Distance by approximately 20.61% and increases IoU by around 24.09% compared to existing semi-supervised baselines, setting a new state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在处理多约束复杂提示时表现不佳，亟需一种不依赖重训练的解决方案。

Method: M3采用多模态、多智能体、多轮次框架，由Planner分解提示，Checker、Refiner、Editor协同修正约束，Verifier确保逐步改进。

Result: 在OneIG-EN基准上超越Imagen4和Seedream 3.0，达到0.532 SOTA分数；GenEval组合指标翻倍提升。

Conclusion: M3作为即插即用模块，证明智能多智能体推理可使开源模型超越商业系统，开辟了无训练的组合生成新范式。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive fidelity in text-to-image synthesis, yet struggle with complex compositional prompts involving multiple constraints. We introduce \textbf{M3 (Multi-Modal, Multi-Agent, Multi-Round)}, a training-free framework that systematically resolves these failures through iterative inference-time refinement. M3 orchestrates off-the-shelf foundation models in a robust multi-agent loop: a Planner decomposes prompts into verifiable checklists, while specialized Checker, Refiner, and Editor agents surgically correct constraints one at a time, with a Verifier ensuring monotonic improvement. Applied to open-source models, M3 achieves remarkable results on the challenging OneIG-EN benchmark, with our Qwen-Image+M3 surpassing commercial flagship systems including Imagen4 (0.515) and Seedream 3.0 (0.530), reaching state-of-the-art performance (0.532 overall). This demonstrates that intelligent multi-agent reasoning can elevate open-source models beyond proprietary alternatives. M3 also substantially improves GenEval compositional metrics, effectively doubling spatial reasoning performance on hardened test sets. As a plug-and-play module compatible with any pre-trained T2I model, M3 establishes a new paradigm for compositional generation without costly retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI方法疾病特异、非实时，且依赖标注异常数据，难以应对骨盆解剖变异和临床集成需求。

Method: 采用残差变分自编码器，仅用健康T2加权矢状位MRI训练，通过重建误差热图检测异常，结合扩散生成数据增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在Uterine Myoma数据集上AUC达0.736，敏感性0.828，特异性0.692，推理速度达92.6帧/秒。

Conclusion: 该框架为骨盆无监督异常检测建立基线，支持实时MRI临床集成，具备良好泛化性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Pelvic diseases in women of reproductive age represent a major global health burden, with diagnosis frequently delayed due to high anatomical variability, complicating MRI interpretation. Existing AI approaches are largely disease-specific and lack real-time compatibility, limiting generalizability and clinical integration. To address these challenges, we establish a benchmark framework for disease- and parameter-agnostic, real-time-compatible unsupervised anomaly detection in pelvic MRI. The method uses a residual variational autoencoder trained exclusively on healthy sagittal T2-weighted scans acquired across diverse imaging protocols to model normal pelvic anatomy. During inference, reconstruction error heatmaps indicate deviations from learned healthy structure, enabling detection of pathological regions without labeled abnormal data. The model is trained on 294 healthy scans and augmented with diffusion-generated synthetic data to improve robustness. Quantitative evaluation on the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset yields an average area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.736, with 0.828 sensitivity and 0.692 specificity. Additional inter-observer clinical evaluation extends analysis to endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and adenomyosis, revealing the influence of anatomical heterogeneity and inter-observer variability on performance interpretation. With a reconstruction time of approximately 92.6 frames per second, the proposed framework establishes a baseline for unsupervised anomaly detection in the female pelvis and supports future integration into real-time MRI. Code is available upon request (https://github.com/AniKnu/UADPelvis), prospective data sets are available for academic collaboration.

### [8] [PhenoLIP: Integrating Phenotype Ontology Knowledge into Medical Vision-Language Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06184)
*Cheng Liang,Chaoyi Wu,Weike Zhao,Ya Zhang,Yanfeng Wang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhenoLIP框架，通过引入表型知识图谱PhenoKG提升医学视觉语言模型的结构化理解能力，显著超越现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学VLMs依赖粗粒度图文对比目标，未能利用医学表型本体中的系统视觉知识。

Method: 构建PhenoKG知识图谱（520K图文对，3000+表型），提出PhenoLIP两阶段预训练框架：先从文本本体学习表型嵌入，再通过教师引导的知识蒸馏融入多模态预训练。

Result: 在新基准PhenoBench上，PhenoLIP比BiomedCLIP在表型分类上提升8.85%，比BIOMEDICA在跨模态检索上提升15.03%。

Conclusion: 融入表型中心先验能显著提升医学VLMs的结构化与可解释性，推动医学图像理解进步。

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale CLIP-like vision-language models(VLMs) has greatly advanced medical image analysis. However, most existing medical VLMs still rely on coarse image-text contrastive objectives and fail to capture the systematic visual knowledge encoded in well-defined medical phenotype ontologies. To address this gap, we construct PhenoKG, the first large-scale, phenotype-centric multimodal knowledge graph that encompasses over 520K high-quality image-text pairs linked to more than 3,000 phenotypes. Building upon PhenoKG, we propose PhenoLIP, a novel pretraining framework that explicitly incorporates structured phenotype knowledge into medical VLMs through a two-stage process. We first learn a knowledge-enhanced phenotype embedding space from textual ontology data and then distill this structured knowledge into multimodal pretraining via a teacher-guided knowledge distillation objective. To support evaluation, we further introduce PhenoBench, an expert-verified benchmark designed for phenotype recognition, comprising over 7,800 image--caption pairs covering more than 1,000 phenotypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhenoLIP outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, improving upon BiomedCLIP in phenotype classification accuracy by 8.85\% and BIOMEDICA in cross-modal retrieval by 15.03%, underscoring the value of integrating phenotype-centric priors into medical VLMs for structured and interpretable medical image understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DPO依赖昂贵的人工偏好标签，难以规模化；合成标注成本低但存在偏差和噪声，需解决其可靠性问题。

Method: 提出DeDPO，引入因果推断中的去偏估计技术，修正合成标注器的系统性偏差，结合少量人工数据与大量AI标注数据进行训练。

Result: DeDPO在多种合成标注方法下均表现稳健，性能达到甚至超越全人工标注模型的理论上限。

Conclusion: DeDPO为低成本、高可扩展的人机对齐提供了新范式，成功利用合成反馈实现高质量模型训练。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a predominant alignment method for diffusion models, facilitating off-policy training without explicit reward modeling. However, its reliance on large-scale, high-quality human preference labels presents a severe cost and scalability bottleneck. To overcome this, We propose a semi-supervised framework augmenting limited human data with a large corpus of unlabeled pairs annotated via cost-effective synthetic AI feedback. Our paper introduces Debiased DPO (DeDPO), which uniquely integrates a debiased estimation technique from causal inference into the DPO objective. By explicitly identifying and correcting the systematic bias and noise inherent in synthetic annotators, DeDPO ensures robust learning from imperfect feedback sources, including self-training and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that DeDPO is robust to the variations in synthetic labeling methods, achieving performance that matches and occasionally exceeds the theoretical upper bound of models trained on fully human-labeled data. This establishes DeDPO as a scalable solution for human-AI alignment using inexpensive synthetic supervision.

TL;DR: AnyThermal 是一种通用热成像骨干网络，通过蒸馏视觉基础模型特征，实现跨环境、跨任务的热图像应用，无需任务特定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有热成像骨干网络依赖任务特定训练和小规模数据，泛化能力差，仅适用于特定环境和任务。

Method: 通过蒸馏 DINOv2 等视觉基础模型的特征到热编码器，并引入新平台 TartanRGBT 收集多环境平衡的 RGB-热数据集。

Result: 在多个环境和任务上达到 SOTA 性能，性能提升最高达 36%。

Conclusion: AnyThermal 结合 TartanRGBT 数据集显著提升了热成像模型的泛化能力与实用性，为跨模态任务提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: We present AnyThermal, a thermal backbone that captures robust task-agnostic thermal features suitable for a variety of tasks such as cross-modal place recognition, thermal segmentation, and monocular depth estimation using thermal images. Existing thermal backbones that follow task-specific training from small-scale data result in utility limited to a specific environment and task. Unlike prior methods, AnyThermal can be used for a wide range of environments (indoor, aerial, off-road, urban) and tasks, all without task-specific training. Our key insight is to distill the feature representations from visual foundation models such as DINOv2 into a thermal encoder using thermal data from these multiple environments. To bridge the diversity gap of the existing RGB-Thermal datasets, we introduce the TartanRGBT platform, the first open-source data collection platform with synced RGB-Thermal image acquisition. We use this payload to collect the TartanRGBT dataset - a diverse and balanced dataset collected in 4 environments. We demonstrate the efficacy of AnyThermal and TartanRGBT, achieving state-of-the-art results with improvements of up to 36% across diverse environments and downstream tasks on existing datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖无人机先验信息（如尺寸或3D网格），且数据集规模小、场景受限，难以评估泛化能力。

Method: DroneKey++采用关键点编码器联合检测与分类，结合基于光线的几何推理与类别嵌入的位姿解码器进行3D位姿估计；构建6DroneSyn合成数据集，涵盖7种无人机模型与88个户外背景。

Result: 在旋转误差上MAE为17.34°、MedAE为17.1°，平移误差MAE为0.135m、MedAE为0.242m，CPU推理速度19.25 FPS，GPU达414.07 FPS，泛化性强且支持实时应用。

Conclusion: DroneKey++实现了无先验的高精度、实时无人机3D位姿估计，6DroneSyn数据集推动了该领域研究，已公开供社区使用。

Abstract: Accurate 3D pose estimation of drones is essential for security and surveillance systems. However, existing methods often rely on prior drone information such as physical sizes or 3D meshes. At the same time, current datasets are small-scale, limited to single models, and collected under constrained environments, which makes reliable validation of generalization difficult. We present DroneKey++, a prior-free framework that jointly performs keypoint detection, drone classification, and 3D pose estimation. The framework employs a keypoint encoder for simultaneous keypoint detection and classification, and a pose decoder that estimates 3D pose using ray-based geometric reasoning and class embeddings. To address dataset limitations, we construct 6DroneSyn, a large-scale synthetic benchmark with over 50K images covering 7 drone models and 88 outdoor backgrounds, generated using 360-degree panoramic synthesis. Experiments show that DroneKey++ achieves MAE 17.34 deg and MedAE 17.1 deg for rotation, MAE 0.135 m and MedAE 0.242 m for translation, with inference speeds of 19.25 FPS (CPU) and 414.07 FPS (GPU), demonstrating both strong generalization across drone models and suitability for real-time applications. The dataset is publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出一种可微分车辆模型框架，使动作基自动驾驶模型能在航点基准上训练和评估，实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准和训练流程多基于航点，导致动作基模型难以训练和比较，进展缓慢。

Method: 设计可微分车辆模型，将预测的动作序列转化为车辆坐标系下的航点轨迹，并在航点空间进行监督。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准上一致优于基线，尤其在NAVSIM navhard上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 该框架弥合了航点与动作基方法的差距，为动作基模型提供了公平的训练与评估环境。

Abstract: End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) systems are typically grouped by the nature of their outputs: (i) waypoint-based models that predict a future trajectory, and (ii) action-based models that directly output throttle, steer and brake. Most recent benchmark protocols and training pipelines are waypoint-based, which makes action-based policies harder to train and compare, slowing their progress. To bridge this waypoint-action gap, we propose a novel, differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space. Our approach enables action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated, for the first time, within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying the underlying evaluation protocol. We extensively evaluate our framework across multiple challenging benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over the baselines. In particular, on NAVSIM \texttt{navhard} our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 通过等能假设和对齐稀疏自编码器，揭示视觉语言模型潜在空间的几何结构，发现双模态原子承载对齐信号，单模态原子导致模态差距，移除后可提升可解释性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的共享嵌入空间几何结构尚不清晰，亟需可解释的分析框架。

Method: 提出等能假设，构建对齐稀疏自编码器（Aligned SAE），在保持重建能力的同时强制跨模态能量一致。

Result: 发现双模态原子承载对齐信号，单模态原子解释模态差距，移除单模态原子可消除差距且不降性能，限制向量运算至双模态子空间提升检索与编辑效果。

Conclusion: 恰当的归纳偏置不仅能保持模型保真度，还能使潜在空间几何结构可解释、可操作。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) align images and text with remarkable success, yet the geometry of their shared embedding space remains poorly understood. To probe this geometry, we begin from the Iso-Energy Assumption, which exploits cross-modal redundancy: a concept that is truly shared should exhibit the same average energy across modalities. We operationalize this assumption with an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction. We find that this inductive bias changes the SAE solution without harming reconstruction, giving us a representation that serves as a tool for geometric analysis. Sanity checks on controlled data with known ground truth confirm that alignment improves when Iso-Energy holds and remains neutral when it does not. Applied to foundational VLMs, our framework reveals a clear structure with practical consequences: (i) sparse bimodal atoms carry the entire cross-modal alignment signal; (ii) unimodal atoms act as modality-specific biases and fully explain the modality gap; (iii) removing unimodal atoms collapses the gap without harming performance; (iv) restricting vector arithmetic to the bimodal subspace yields in-distribution edits and improved retrieval. These findings suggest that the right inductive bias can both preserve model fidelity and render the latent geometry interpretable and actionable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于严重遮挡和相机、手、物体的复杂耦合运动，从野外单目视频中重建物体3D形状仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过联合预测2D遮罩修复与3D形状补全的前馈框架，实现高效手-物遮挡处理，并构建首个大规模高保真手-物交互合成数据集。

Result: ForeHOI 在物体重建上达到SOTA性能，推理时间仅一分钟，速度提升约100倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决单目视频中严重遮挡问题，为 embodied intelligence 提供高效物体重建方案。

Abstract: The ubiquity of monocular videos capturing daily hand-object interactions presents a valuable resource for embodied intelligence. While 3D hand reconstruction from in-the-wild videos has seen significant progress, reconstructing the involved objects remains challenging due to severe occlusions and the complex, coupled motion of the camera, hands, and object. In this paper, we introduce ForeHOI, a novel feed-forward model that directly reconstructs 3D object geometry from monocular hand-object interaction videos within one minute of inference time, eliminating the need for any pre-processing steps. Our key insight is that, the joint prediction of 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion in a feed-forward framework can effectively address the problem of severe occlusion in monocular hand-held object videos, thereby achieving results that outperform the performance of optimization-based methods. The information exchanges between the 2D and 3D shape completion boosts the overall reconstruction quality, enabling the framework to effectively handle severe hand-object occlusion. Furthermore, to support the training of our model, we contribute the first large-scale, high-fidelity synthetic dataset of hand-object interactions with comprehensive annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForeHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in object reconstruction, significantly outperforming previous methods with around a 100x speedup.

*Aman Anand,Amir Eskandari,Elyas Rahsno,Farhana Zulkernine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ASMa方法，通过非对称时空掩码和特征对齐提升骨架动作识别的自监督学习效果，并通过知识蒸馏实现轻量化部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督方法因过度依赖高运动帧和高连接度关节的掩码，导致特征表示偏倚，泛化能力不足。

Method: 引入非对称时空掩码（ASMa），结合高/低连接度关节与高/低运动帧的互补掩码策略，并设计可学习特征对齐模块，最后通过知识蒸馏压缩模型。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60/120和PKU-MMD上优于现有SSL方法，微调提升2.7-4.4%，迁移学习最高提升5.9%；蒸馏模型参数减少91.4%，推理速度提升3倍。

Conclusion: ASMa实现了更均衡的骨架特征学习，兼顾性能与效率，为边缘设备部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown remarkable success in skeleton-based action recognition by leveraging data augmentations to learn meaningful representations. However, existing SSL methods rely on data augmentations that predominantly focus on masking high-motion frames and high-degree joints such as joints with degree 3 or 4. This results in biased and incomplete feature representations that struggle to generalize across varied motion patterns. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Spatio-temporal Masking (ASMa) for Skeleton Action Representation Learning, a novel combination of masking to learn a full spectrum of spatio-temporal dynamics inherent in human actions. ASMa employs two complementary masking strategies: one that selectively masks high-degree joints and low-motion, and another that masks low-degree joints and high-motion frames. These masking strategies ensure a more balanced and comprehensive skeleton representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable feature alignment module to effectively align the representations learned from both masked views. To facilitate deployment in resource-constrained settings and on low-resource devices, we compress the learned and aligned representation into a lightweight model using knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SSL methods with an average improvement of 2.7-4.4% in fine-tuning and up to 5.9% in transfer learning to noisy datasets and achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised baselines. Our distilled model achieves 91.4% parameter reduction and 3x faster inference on edge devices while maintaining competitive accuracy, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

TL;DR: 使用视觉变换器基于指纹图像区分Kabuki综合征和Wiedemann-Steiner综合征，实现非侵入性辅助诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管遗传检测是诊断金标准，但许多患者因检测可及性和专家资源有限而未被诊断，而皮肤纹理异常作为重要临床特征尚未被充分用于诊断。

Method: 构建基于视觉变换器的深度学习模型，利用指纹图像进行三组二分类任务，并通过注意力可视化提升模型可解释性。

Result: 模型在控制组vs.KS、控制组vs.WSS、KSvs.WSS三组任务中AUC分别为0.80、0.73、0.85，F1分数分别为0.71、0.72、0.83。

Conclusion: 指纹图像中存在综合征特异性特征，AI模型可作为非侵入、可解释且易获取的早期诊断辅助工具，提升罕见遗传病的诊断率。

Abstract: Kabuki syndrome (KS) and Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) are rare but distinct developmental disorders that share overlapping clinical features, including neurodevelopmental delay, growth restriction, and persistent fetal fingertip pads. While genetic testing remains the diagnostic gold standard, many individuals with KS or WSS remain undiagnosed due to barriers in access to both genetic testing and expertise. Dermatoglyphic anomalies, despite being established hallmarks of several genetic syndromes, remain an underutilized diagnostic signal in the era of molecular testing. This study presents a vision transformer-based deep learning model that leverages fingerprint images to distinguish individuals with KS and WSS from unaffected controls and from one another. We evaluate model performance across three binary classification tasks. Across the three classification tasks, the model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83, respectively. Beyond classification, we apply attention-based visualizations to identify fingerprint regions most salient to model predictions, enhancing interpretability. Together, these findings suggest the presence of syndrome-specific fingerprint features, demonstrating the feasibility of a fingerprint-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool as a noninvasive, interpretable, and accessible future diagnostic aid for the early diagnosis of underdiagnosed genetic syndromes.

TL;DR: 提出MMEarth-Bench多模态地理数据集和TTT-MMR测试时训练方法，提升模型在有限数据和地理泛化上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理空间基准数据集模态少、全球代表性差，难以评估多模态预训练模型的全局表现。

Method: 构建包含12种模态的MMEarth-Bench数据集，并提出模型无关的测试时训练方法TTT-MMR，利用测试时所有模态作为辅助任务进行重建。

Result: 预训练提升小数据场景鲁棒性，但地理泛化仍差；TTT-MMR显著提升随机与地理分布测试集性能，地理分批实现正则化与特化平衡。

Conclusion: MMEarth-Bench为多模态地理预训练提供新基准，TTT-MMR有效增强模型跨地域适应能力，开源数据与工具推动领域发展。

Abstract: Recent research in geospatial machine learning has demonstrated that models pretrained with self-supervised learning on Earth observation data can perform well on downstream tasks with limited training data. However, most of the existing geospatial benchmark datasets have few data modalities and poor global representation, limiting the ability to evaluate multimodal pretrained models at global scales. To fill this gap, we introduce MMEarth-Bench, a collection of five new multimodal environmental tasks with 12 modalities, globally distributed data, and both in- and out-of-distribution test splits. We benchmark a diverse set of pretrained models and find that while (multimodal) pretraining tends to improve model robustness in limited data settings, geographic generalization abilities remain poor. In order to facilitate model adaptation to new downstream tasks and geographic domains, we propose a model-agnostic method for test-time training with multimodal reconstruction (TTT-MMR) that uses all the modalities available at test time as auxiliary tasks, regardless of whether a pretrained model accepts them as input. Our method improves model performance on both the random and geographic test splits, and geographic batching leads to a good trade-off between regularization and specialization during TTT. Our dataset, code, and visualization tool are linked from the project page at lgordon99.github.io/mmearth-bench.

Motivation: 术前与术中多模态图像因模态差异和组织形变导致配准困难，需提升术中导航精度。

Method: 使用模态无关邻域描述符提取特征，结合多级金字塔融合优化机制，通过密集相关分析与加权平衡耦合凸优化实现全局与局部位移场优化。

Result: 在ReMIND2Reg验证与测试阶段均获第一，Resect数据集上平均TRE为1.798 mm。

Conclusion: MCPO方法有效解决术前-术中多模态图像配准难题，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Surgical navigation based on multimodal image registration has played a significant role in providing intraoperative guidance to surgeons by showing the relative position of the target area to critical anatomical structures during surgery. However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during the surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2025, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation pyramidal optimization (MCPO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the displacement field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2025. Based on the results, our method achieved the first place in the validation phase and test phase of ReMIND2Reg. The MCPO is also validated on the Resect dataset, achieving an average TRE of 1.798 mm. This demonstrates the broad applicability of our method in preoperative-to-intraoperative image registration.

TL;DR: 通过用卷积算子替代Vision Transformer中的线性层，实现其在BPU硬件上的高效部署，无需重训练，推理速度提升3.8倍，精度损失极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BPU硬件专为CNN优化，无法直接加速Vision Transformer的三维线性层计算，导致其优势无法发挥。

Method: 用精心设计的卷积算子替代ViT中的线性层和层归一化，保留原有权重，无需微调。

Result: DeiT-Base在ImageNet上精度80.4%（原81.8%），推理速度提升3.8倍；花卉分类任务精度仅降0.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法首次成功实现ViT在BPU上的全速部署，兼顾效率与精度，为Transformer硬件加速提供新路径。

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, specialized neural processing hardware such as Brain Processing Units (BPUs) have emerged as dedicated platforms for CNN acceleration, offering optimized INT8 computation capabilities for convolutional operations. Meanwhile, Vision Transformer (ViT) models, such as the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), have demonstrated superior performance and play increasingly crucial roles in computer vision tasks. However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of Vision Transformers that fully leverages BPU classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the quantized DeiT-Base model achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the original 81.8%, while obtaining up to a 3.8* inference speedup. Our finetuned DeiT model on the flower classification dataset also achieves excellent performance, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop for the DeiT-Base model, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长期非平稳环境中性能下降，缺乏对模型长期适应能力的有效保障。

Method: 提出自适应平衡重初始化（ABR）策略，根据标签翻转变化动态决定模型权重重置时机。

Result: 在多个CTTA基准上验证，ABR显著优于现有方法，长期性能更稳定。

Conclusion: 标签翻转轨迹可作为衡量模型适应状态的指标，自适应重初始化是提升持续域适应长期性能的有效手段。

Abstract: Continual test-time domain adaptation (CTTA) aims to adjust models so that they can perform well over time across non-stationary environments. While previous methods have made considerable efforts to optimize the adaptation process, a crucial question remains: Can the model adapt to continually changing environments over a long time? In this work, we explore facilitating better CTTA in the long run using a re-initialization (or reset) based method. First, we observe that the long-term performance is associated with the trajectory pattern in label flip. Based on this observed correlation, we propose a simple yet effective policy, Adaptive-and-Balanced Re-initialization (ABR), towards preserving the model's long-term performance. In particular, ABR performs weight re-initialization using adaptive intervals. The adaptive interval is determined based on the change in label flip. The proposed method is validated on extensive CTTA benchmarks, achieving superior performance.

TL;DR: 提出CER框架，通过粗到细的级联过滤实现高效鲁棒的分布外检测，降低32%计算开销并显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对低级噪声执行全量推理，造成资源浪费和语义幻觉，亟需高效且避免误判的OoD检测方案。

Method: CER框架包含两模块：结构能量筛（SES）利用拉普拉斯算子在入口拦截物理异常；语义感知超球面能量（SHE）解耦特征幅值与方向，识别细粒度语义偏差。

Result: 在CIFAR-100上FPR95从33.58%降至22.84%，AUROC提升至93.97%，计算开销减少32%，真实传感器故障场景表现远超SOTA。

Conclusion: CER是通用插件式框架，可无缝集成至现有模型，实现高效、准确、鲁棒的OoD检测。

Abstract: Efficient and robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is paramount for safety-critical applications.However, existing methods still execute full-scale inference on low-level statistical noise. This computational mismatch not only incurs resource waste but also induces semantic hallucination, where deep networks forcefully interpret physical anomalies as high-confidence semantic features.To address this, we propose the Cascaded Early Rejection (CER) framework, which realizes hierarchical filtering for anomaly detection via a coarse-to-fine logic.CER comprises two core modules: 1)Structural Energy Sieve (SES), which establishes a non-parametric barrier at the network entry using the Laplacian operator to efficiently intercept physical signal anomalies; and 2) the Semantically-aware Hyperspherical Energy (SHE) detector, which decouples feature magnitude from direction in intermediate layers to identify fine-grained semantic deviations. Experimental results demonstrate that CER not only reduces computational overhead by 32% but also achieves a significant performance leap on the CIFAR-100 benchmark:the average FPR95 drastically decreases from 33.58% to 22.84%, and AUROC improves to 93.97%. Crucially, in real-world scenarios simulating sensor failures, CER exhibits performance far exceeding state-of-the-art methods. As a universal plugin, CER can be seamlessly integrated into various SOTA models to provide performance gains.

Motivation: SAM3依赖预定义提示，面对数据漂移和概念漂移时对齐失效，亟需鲁棒性校准方法。

Method: 构建目标域特定的概念库，通过类间视觉原型锚定证据、挖掘代表性支持抑制异常值、融合候选概念修正概念漂移。

Result: 在自然场景和遥感图像等困难场景中显著提升SAM3的适应性，建立新的鲁棒高效OVS基准。

Conclusion: ConceptBank是一种参数-free、高效且通用的漂移校准框架，可无缝集成到现有提示分割模型中。

Abstract: The recent introduction of \texttt{SAM3} has revolutionized Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) through \textit{promptable concept segmentation}, which grounds pixel predictions in flexible concept prompts. However, this reliance on pre-defined concepts makes the model vulnerable: when visual distributions shift (\textit{data drift}) or conditional label distributions evolve (\textit{concept drift}) in the target domain, the alignment between visual evidence and prompts breaks down. In this work, we present \textsc{ConceptBank}, a parameter-free calibration framework to restore this alignment on the fly. Instead of adhering to static prompts, we construct a dataset-specific concept bank from the target statistics. Our approach (\textit{i}) anchors target-domain evidence via class-wise visual prototypes, (\textit{ii}) mines representative supports to suppress outliers under data drift, and (\textit{iii}) fuses candidate concepts to rectify concept drift. We demonstrate that \textsc{ConceptBank} effectively adapts \texttt{SAM3} to distribution drifts, including challenging natural-scene and remote-sensing scenarios, establishing a new baseline for robustness and efficiency in OVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SPDA-SAM，通过自动生成提示和RGB-D融合提升SAM的实例分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM依赖人工提示且RGB图像缺乏深度信息，限制了空间结构感知与边界划分能力

Method: 设计语义-空间自提示模块（SSSPM）自动生成提示，并引入粗到细RGB-D融合模块（C2FFM）融合深度信息

Result: 在12个数据集上超越现有SOTA方法，验证了自提示与深度融合的有效性

Conclusion: 自生成提示和深度信息融合显著提升了SAM的分割精度与泛化能力

Abstract: Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated strong generalizability in various instance segmentation tasks. However, its performance is severely dependent on the quality of manual prompts. In addition, the RGB images that instance segmentation methods normally use inherently lack depth information. As a result, the ability of these methods to perceive spatial structures and delineate object boundaries is hindered. To address these challenges, we propose a Self-prompted Depth-Aware SAM (SPDA-SAM) for instance segmentation. Specifically, we design a Semantic-Spatial Self-prompt Module (SSSPM) which extracts the semantic and spatial prompts from the image encoder and the mask decoder of SAM, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine RGB-D Fusion Module (C2FFM), in which the features extracted from a monocular RGB image and the depth map estimated from it are fused. In particular, the structural information in the depth map is used to provide coarse-grained guidance to feature fusion, while local variations in depth are encoded in order to fuse fine-grained feature representations. To our knowledge, SAM has not been explored in such self-prompted and depth-aware manners. Experimental results demonstrate that our SPDA-SAM outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts across twelve different data sets. These promising results should be due to the guidance of the self-prompts and the compensation for the spatial information loss by the coarse-to-fine RGB-D fusion operation.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理单目视频中动态人体遮挡时，或因生成模型导致时间闪烁，或因刚性几何假设无法捕捉多样外观，导致渲染质量严重下降。

Method: 将任务重构为异方差观测噪声下的最大后验估计问题，提出U-4DGS框架，结合概率变形网络与双光栅化管道，生成像素对齐的不确定性图作为自适应梯度调制器，并引入置信感知正则化以抑制几何漂移。

Conclusion: 通过不确定性驱动的自适应机制，U-4DGS有效解决了遮挡场景下的动态人体渲染难题，为真实感重建提供了新范式。

Abstract: High-fidelity rendering of dynamic humans from monocular videos typically degrades catastrophically under occlusions. Existing solutions incorporate external priors-either hallucinating missing content via generative models, which induces severe temporal flickering, or imposing rigid geometric heuristics that fail to capture diverse appearances. To this end, we reformulate the task as a Maximum A Posteriori estimation problem under heteroscedastic observation noise. In this paper, we propose U-4DGS, a framework integrating a Probabilistic Deformation Network and a Double Rasterization pipeline. This architecture renders pixel-aligned uncertainty maps that act as an adaptive gradient modulator, automatically attenuating artifacts from unreliable observations. Furthermore, to prevent geometric drift in regions lacking reliable visual cues, we enforce Confidence-Aware Regularizations, which leverage the learned uncertainty to selectively propagate spatial-temporal validity. Extensive experiments on ZJU-MoCap and OcMotion demonstrate that U-4DGS achieves SOTA rendering fidelity and robustness.

Motivation: 现有快速流模型因随机配对噪声-数据样本导致轨迹漂移，且时间步误差累积造成严重偏离。

Method: 用模型预测的边际速度替代条件速度，并引入每时间步的轨迹校正策略以对齐生成与真实样本的边际分布。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上仅用1步采样达到FID 1.52，刷新SOTA。

Conclusion: FlowConsist通过保证轨迹一致性显著提升快速流模型的生成质量与稳定性。

Abstract: Fast flow models accelerate the iterative sampling process by learning to directly predict ODE path integrals, enabling one-step or few-step generation. However, we argue that current fast-flow training paradigms suffer from two fundamental issues. First, conditional velocities constructed from randomly paired noise-data samples introduce systematic trajectory drift, preventing models from following a consistent ODE path. Second, the model's approximation errors accumulate over time steps, leading to severe deviations across long time intervals. To address these issues, we propose FlowConsist, a training framework designed to enforce trajectory consistency in fast flows. We propose a principled alternative that replaces conditional velocities with the marginal velocities predicted by the model itself, aligning optimization with the true trajectory. To further address error accumulation over time steps, we introduce a trajectory rectification strategy that aligns the marginal distributions of generated and real samples at every time step along the trajectory. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet 256$\times$256, achieving an FID of 1.52 with only 1 sampling step.

Conclusion: Di3PO通过区域隔离策略有效提升了偏好调优的效率与效果，适用于需要精细控制的T2I任务。

Abstract: Existing methods for preference tuning of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often rely on computationally expensive generation steps to create positive and negative pairs of images. These approaches frequently yield training pairs that either lack meaningful differences, are expensive to sample and filter, or exhibit significant variance in irrelevant pixel regions, thereby degrading training efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce "Di3PO", a novel method for constructing positive and negative pairs that isolates specific regions targeted for improvement during preference tuning, while keeping the surrounding context in the image stable. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it to the challenging task of text rendering in diffusion models, showcasing improvements over baseline methods of SFT and DPO.

Conclusion: AUNet通过不确定性感知与自适应交互，实现了对不完整模态输入的鲁棒处理，为全天候行人检测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Existing cross-modal pedestrian detection (CMPD) employs complementary information from RGB and thermal-infrared (TIR) modalities to detect pedestrians in 24h-surveillance systems.RGB captures rich pedestrian details under daylight, while TIR excels at night. However, TIR focuses primarily on the person's silhouette, neglecting critical texture details essential for detection. While the near-infrared (NIR) captures texture under low-light conditions, which effectively alleviates performance issues of RGB and detail loss in TIR, thereby reducing missed detections. To this end, we construct a new Triplet RGB-NIR-TIR (TRNT) dataset, comprising 8,281 pixel-aligned image triplets, establishing a comprehensive foundation for algorithmic research. However, due to the variable nature of real-world scenarios, imaging devices may not always capture all three modalities simultaneously. This results in input data with unpredictable combinations of modal types, which challenge existing CMPD methods that fail to extract robust pedestrian information under arbitrary input combinations, leading to significant performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Network (AUNet) for accurately discriminating modal availability and fully utilizing the available information under uncertain inputs. Specifically, we introduce Unified Modality Validation Refinement (UMVR), which includes an uncertainty-aware router to validate modal availability and a semantic refinement to ensure the reliability of information within the modality. Furthermore, we design a Modality-Aware Interaction (MAI) module to adaptively activate or deactivate its internal interaction mechanisms per UMVR output, enabling effective complementary information fusion from available modalities.

Conclusion: OC-SOD为显著性检测提供了更贴近人类感知的范式，推动计算模型与认知科学的融合。

Abstract: Salient object detection is inherently a subjective problem, as observers with different priors may perceive different objects as salient. However, existing methods predominantly formulate it as an objective prediction task with a single groundtruth segmentation map for each image, which renders the problem under-determined and fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD), where salient regions are predicted by considering not only the visual cues but also the observer-specific factors such as their preferences or intents. As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction. By leveraging multi-modal large language models, we develop an efficient data annotation pipeline and construct the first OC-SOD dataset named OC-SODBench, comprising 33k training, validation and test images with 152k textual prompts and object pairs. Built upon this new dataset, we further design OC-SODAgent, an agentic baseline which performs OC-SOD via a human-like "Perceive-Reflect-Adjust" process. Extensive experiments on our proposed OC-SODBench have justified the effectiveness of our contribution. Through this observer-centric perspective, we aim to bridge the gap between human perception and computational modeling, offering a more realistic and flexible understanding of what makes an object truly "salient."

Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models has catalyzed the emergence of GUI agents, which hold immense potential for automating complex tasks, from online shopping to flight booking, thereby alleviating the burden of repetitive digital workflows. As a foundational capability, GUI grounding is typically established as a prerequisite for end-to-end task execution. It enables models to precisely locate interface elements, such as text and icons, to perform accurate operations like clicking and typing. Unlike prior works that fine-tune models already possessing strong spatial awareness (e.g., Qwen3-VL), we aim to master the full technical pipeline by starting from a base model with minimal grounding ability, such as POINTS-1.5. We introduce POINTS-GUI-G-8B, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with scores of 59.9 on ScreenSpot-Pro, 66.0 on OSWorld-G, 95.7 on ScreenSpot-v2, and 49.9 on UI-Vision. Our model's success is driven by three key factors: (1) Refined Data Engineering, involving the unification of diverse open-source datasets format alongside sophisticated strategies for augmentation, filtering, and difficulty grading; (2) Improved Training Strategies, including continuous fine-tuning of the vision encoder to enhance perceptual accuracy and maintaining resolution consistency between training and inference; and (3) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Rewards. While RL is traditionally used to bolster reasoning, we demonstrate that it significantly improves precision in the perception-intensive GUI grounding task. Furthermore, GUI grounding provides a natural advantage for RL, as rewards are easily verifiable and highly accurate.

Conclusion: TFusionOcc通过几何更灵活的表示与多传感器融合，显著提升了3D语义占有预测的精度与鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to perceive fine-grained geometric and semantic structure of their surroundings from onboard sensors, which is essential for safe decision-making and navigation. Recent models for 3D semantic occupancy prediction have successfully addressed the challenge of describing real-world objects with varied shapes and classes. However, the intermediate representations used by existing methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction rely heavily on 3D voxel volumes or a set of 3D Gaussians, hindering the model's ability to efficiently and effectively capture fine-grained geometric details in the 3D driving environment. This paper introduces TFusionOcc, a novel object-centric multi-sensor fusion framework for predicting 3D semantic occupancy. By leveraging multi-stage multi-sensor fusion, Student's t-distribution, and the T-Mixture model (TMM), together with more geometrically flexible primitives, such as the deformable superquadric (superquadric with inverse warp), the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the nuScenes benchmark. In addition, extensive experiments were conducted on the nuScenes-C dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in different camera and lidar corruption scenarios. The code will be available at: https://github.com/DanielMing123/TFusionOcc

Conclusion: MeDocVL有效解决医疗文档解析中的噪声与精度矛盾，为医疗信息抽取提供了新范式。

Abstract: Medical document OCR is challenging due to complex layouts, domain-specific terminology, and noisy annotations, while requiring strict field-level exact matching. Existing OCR systems and general-purpose vision-language models often fail to reliably parse such documents. We propose MeDocVL, a post-trained vision-language model for query-driven medical document parsing. Our framework combines Training-driven Label Refinement to construct high-quality supervision from noisy annotations, with a Noise-aware Hybrid Post-training strategy that integrates reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to achieve robust and precise extraction. Experiments on medical invoice benchmarks show that MeDocVL consistently outperforms conventional OCR systems and strong VLM baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance under noisy supervision.

Conclusion: 该模型推进了昆虫计算建模，提供了一种可泛化、支持稀疏计算的生物启发视觉框架。

Abstract: Insect vision supports complex behaviors including associative learning, navigation, and object detection, and has long motivated computational models for understanding biological visual processing. However, many contemporary models prioritize task performance while neglecting biologically grounded processing pathways. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways. Collectively, these results advance insect computational modelling by providing a generalizable bio-inspired vision model capable of sparse computation across diverse tasks.

Motivation: LiDAR在远距离点云稀疏，导致检测困难，现有方法直接使用虚拟点增加计算负担且融合效果不佳。

Method: 提出PointViT，采用Transformer联合处理真实LiDAR点与选择性采样的虚拟点，通过BEV门控融合与稀疏卷积编码，结合Transformer查询优化检测。

Result: 在KITTI上Car类达到91.16% 3D AP、95.94% BEV AP和99.36% 2D AP。

Conclusion: PointViT有效平衡精度与效率，选择性融合虚拟点显著提升远距离检测性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors often struggle to detect far-field objects due to the sparsity of point clouds at long ranges, which limits the availability of reliable geometric cues. To address this, prior approaches augment LiDAR data with depth-completed virtual points derived from RGB images; however, directly incorporating all virtual points leads to increased computational cost and introduces challenges in effectively fusing real and virtual information. We present Point Virtual Transformer (PointViT), a transformer-based 3D object detection framework that jointly reasons over raw LiDAR points and selectively sampled virtual points. The framework examines multiple fusion strategies, ranging from early point-level fusion to BEV-based gated fusion, and analyses their trade-offs in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The fused point cloud is voxelized and encoded using sparse convolutions to form a BEV representation, from which a compact set of high-confidence object queries is initialised and refined through a transformer-based context aggregation module. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark report 91.16% 3D AP, 95.94% BEV AP, and 99.36% AP on the KITTI 2D detection benchmark for the Car class.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D显著性方法依赖手工几何特征或缺乏语义感知的学习方法，无法解释人类为何关注语义重要但几何不突出的区域。

Method: 采用双流架构，通过非对称跨模态融合，结合扩散语义先验与点云变换器，利用交叉注意机制使几何特征引导语义检索，并通过强化学习生成符合拓扑结构的时序扫描路径。

Result: 在SAL3D、NUS3D和3DVA数据集上显著优于现有方法，验证了认知启发架构的有效性。

Conclusion: 认知驱动的架构能更真实地建模人类在3D表面的视觉注意行为。

Abstract: Human visual attention on three-dimensional objects emerges from the interplay between bottom-up geometric processing and top-down semantic recognition. Existing 3D saliency methods rely on hand-crafted geometric features or learning-based approaches that lack semantic awareness, failing to explain why humans fixate on semantically meaningful but geometrically unremarkable regions. We introduce SemGeo-AttentionNet, a dual-stream architecture that explicitly formalizes this dichotomy through asymmetric cross-modal fusion, leveraging diffusion-based semantic priors from geometry-conditioned multi-view rendering and point cloud transformers for geometric processing. Cross-attention ensures geometric features query semantic content, enabling bottom-up distinctiveness to guide top-down retrieval. We extend our framework to temporal scanpath generation through reinforcement learning, introducing the first formulation respecting 3D mesh topology with inhibition-of-return dynamics. Evaluation on SAL3D, NUS3D and 3DVA datasets demonstrates substantial improvements, validating how cognitively motivated architectures effectively model human visual attention on three-dimensional surfaces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对去噪步骤统一传播结果奖励，忽略每步局部影响及轨迹内长期依赖，导致奖励稀疏与效果受限。

Method: TP-GRPO提出步级增量奖励替代结果奖励，并通过增量奖励符号变化自动识别转折点，赋予其长期累积奖励以捕捉延迟影响。

Result: TP-GRPO更有效地利用奖励信号，显著提升生成质量，且无需超参数调整。

Conclusion: TP-GRPO通过精细化奖励分配和长期依赖建模，为流匹配模型的强化学习提供了更高效、鲁棒的训练框架。

Abstract: Deploying GRPO on Flow Matching models has proven effective for text-to-image generation. However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's "pure" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation. Demo code is available at https://github.com/YunzeTong/TurningPoint-GRPO.

Conclusion: 姿态-only表示有效缓解线性化误差，提升VIO在挑战性环境中的鲁棒性与精度，为滤波式VIO提供新范式。

Abstract: Mainstream Visual-inertial odometry 
(VIO) systems rely on point features for motion estimation and localization. However, their performance degrades in challenging scenarios. Moreover, the localization accuracy of multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF)-based VIO systems suffers from linearization errors associated with feature 3D coordinates and delayed measurement updates. To improve the performance of VIO in challenging scenes, we first propose a pose-only geometric representation for line features. Building on this, we develop POPL-KF, a Kalman filter-based VIO system that employs a pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features. POPL-KF mitigates linearization errors by explicitly eliminating both point and line feature coordinates from the measurement equations, while enabling immediate update of visual measurements. We also design a unified base-frames selection algorithm for both point and line features to ensure optimal constraints on camera poses within the pose-only measurement model. To further improve line feature quality, a line feature filter based on image grid segmentation and bidirectional optical flow consistency is proposed. Our system is evaluated on public datasets and real-world experiments, demonstrating that POPL-KF outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) filter-based methods (OpenVINS, PO-KF) and optimization-based methods (PL-VINS, EPLF-VINS), while maintaining real-time performance.

Result: 在成功率和路径效率等关键指标上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了无外部先验的室外到室内连续导航，为真实场景部署提供了新范式。

Abstract: Embodied navigation holds significant promise for real-world applications such as last-mile delivery. However, most existing approaches are confined to either indoor or outdoor environments and rely heavily on strong assumptions, such as access to precise coordinate systems. While current outdoor methods can guide agents to the vicinity of a target using coarse-grained localization, they fail to enable fine-grained entry through specific building entrances, critically limiting their utility in practical deployment scenarios that require seamless outdoor-to-indoor transitions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: out-to-in prior-free instruction-driven embodied navigation. This formulation explicitly eliminates reliance on accurate external priors, requiring agents to navigate solely based on egocentric visual observations guided by instructions. To tackle this task, we propose a vision-centric embodied navigation framework that leverages image-based prompts to drive decision-making. Additionally, we present the first open-source dataset for this task, featuring a pipeline that integrates trajectory-conditioned video synthesis into the data generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across key metrics including success rate and path efficiency.

Conclusion: ChatUMM实现了统一多模态模型从单轮求解器向连续对话助手的转变，为多模态对话系统提供了新范式。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable progress yet remain constrained by a single-turn interaction paradigm, effectively functioning as solvers for independent requests rather than assistants in continuous dialogue. To bridge this gap, we present ChatUMM. As a conversational unified model, it excels at robust context tracking to sustain interleaved multimodal generation. ChatUMM derives its capabilities from two key innovations: an interleaved multi-turn training strategy that models serialized text-image streams as a continuous conversational flow, and a systematic conversational data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline transforms a diverse set of standard single-turn datasets into fluid dialogues through three progressive stages: constructing basic stateful dialogues, enforcing long-range dependency resolution via ``distractor'' turns with history-dependent query rewriting, and synthesizing naturally interleaved multimodal responses. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ChatUMM achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source unified models on visual understanding and instruction-guided editing benchmarks, while maintaining competitive fidelity in text-to-image generation. Notably, ChatUMM exhibits superior robustness in complex multi-turn scenarios, ensuring fluid, context-aware dialogues.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently attracted increasing interest in unifying Vision-Language-Action (VLA) with World Models to enhance decision-making and forward-looking imagination. However, existing methods fail to effectively unify future scene evolution and action planning within a single architecture due to inadequate sharing of latent states, limiting the impact of visual imagination on action decisions. To address this limitation, we propose DriveWorld-VLA, a novel framework that unifies world modeling and planning within a latent space by tightly integrating VLA and world models at the representation level, which enables the VLA planner to benefit directly from holistic scene-evolution modeling and reducing reliance on dense annotated supervision. Additionally, DriveWorld-VLA incorporates the latent states of the world model as core decision-making states for the VLA planner, facilitating the planner to assess how candidate actions impact future scene evolution. By conducting world modeling entirely in the latent space, DriveWorld-VLA supports controllable, action-conditioned imagination at the feature level, avoiding expensive pixel-level rollouts. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of DriveWorld-VLA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.3 PDMS on NAVSIMv1, 86.8 EPDMS on NAVSIMv2, and 0.16 3-second average collision rate on nuScenes. Code and models will be released in https://github.com/liulin815/DriveWorld-VLA.git.

Result: UnionST-S训练的模型在部分场景超越真实数据性能；SEL框架仅用9%真实标签即实现竞争性能

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据可有效弥补真实数据不足，SEL框架显著降低对标注数据的依赖，推动STR模型实用化

Abstract: Large-scale and categorical-balanced text data is essential for training effective Scene Text Recognition (STR) models, which is hard to achieve when collecting real data. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective and perfectly labeled alternative. However, its performance often lags behind, revealing a significant domain gap between real and current synthetic data. In this work, we systematically analyze mainstream rendering-based synthetic datasets and identify their key limitations: insufficient diversity in corpus, font, and layout, which restricts their realism in complex scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce UnionST, a strong data engine synthesizes text covering a union of challenging samples and better aligns with the complexity observed in the wild. We then construct UnionST-S, a large-scale synthetic dataset with improved simulations in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a self-evolution learning (SEL) framework for effective real data annotation. Experiments show that models trained on UnionST-S achieve significant improvements over existing synthetic datasets. They even surpass real-data performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, when using SEL, the trained models achieve competitive performance by only seeing 9% of real data labels.

Conclusion: LIBERO-X通过结合分层评估与多样化数据，为VLA模型的可靠评估与发展提供了更坚实的基础

Abstract: Reliable benchmarking is critical for advancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, as it reveals their generalization, robustness, and alignment of perception with language-driven manipulation tasks. However, existing benchmarks often provide limited or misleading assessments due to insufficient evaluation protocols that inadequately capture real-world distribution shifts. This work systematically rethinks VLA benchmarking from both evaluation and data perspectives, introducing LIBERO-X, a benchmark featuring: 1) A hierarchical evaluation protocol with progressive difficulty levels targeting three core capabilities: spatial generalization, object recognition, and task instruction understanding. This design enables fine-grained analysis of performance degradation under increasing environmental and task complexity; 2) A high-diversity training dataset collected via human teleoperation, where each scene supports multiple fine-grained manipulation objectives to bridge the train-evaluation distribution gap. Experiments with representative VLA models reveal significant performance drops under cumulative perturbations, exposing persistent limitations in scene comprehension and instruction grounding. By integrating hierarchical evaluation with diverse training data, LIBERO-X offers a more reliable foundation for assessing and advancing VLA development.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become increasingly challenging as forgery faces synthesized by AI-generated methods, particularly diffusion models, achieve unprecedented quality and resolution. Existing forgery detection approaches relying on spatial and frequency features demonstrate limited efficacy against high-quality, entirely synthesized forgeries. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method grounded in the observation that facial attributes governed by complex physical laws and multiple parameters are inherently difficult to replicate. Specifically, we focus on illumination, particularly the specular reflection component in the Phong illumination model, which poses the greatest replication challenge due to its parametric complexity and nonlinear formulation. We introduce a fast and accurate face texture estimation method based on Retinex theory to enable precise specular reflection separation. Furthermore, drawing from the mathematical formulation of specular reflection, we posit that forgery evidence manifests not only in the specular reflection itself but also in its relationship with corresponding face texture and direct light. To address this issue, we design the Specular-Reflection-Inconsistency-Network (SRI-Net), incorporating a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to capture these correlations and integrate specular reflection related features with image features for robust forgery detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both traditional deepfake datasets and generative deepfake datasets, particularly those containing diffusion-generated forgery faces.

Abstract: Foundation object detectors such as GLIP and Grounding DINO excel on general-domain data but often degrade in specialized and data-scarce settings like underwater imagery or industrial defects. Typical cross-domain few-shot approaches rely on fine-tuning scarce target data, incurring cost and overfitting risks. We instead ask: Can a frozen detector adapt with only one exemplar per class without training? To answer this, we introduce training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection, where detectors must adapt to specialized domains with only one annotated exemplar per class and no weight updates. To tackle this task, we propose LAB-Det, which exploits Language As a domain-invariant Bridge. Instead of adapting visual features, we project each exemplar into a descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector. This linguistic conditioning replaces gradient-based adaptation, enabling robust generalization in data-scarce domains. We evaluate on UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects), two widely adopted benchmarks for data-scarce detection, where object boundaries are often ambiguous, and LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating a single parameter. These results establish linguistic adaptation as an efficient and interpretable alternative to fine-tuning in specialized detection settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVSM的全自注意力机制计算复杂度高且参数共享僵化，限制了效率和泛化能力。

Method: 提出双流架构，分离输入视图的自注意力与目标视图的自注意力-交叉注意力机制，实现计算解耦。

Result: 在RealEstate10K上达29.86 dB PSNR，提升0.2 dB，训练快2倍，推理快4.4倍，零样本泛化强，支持KV缓存增量推理。

Conclusion: Efficient-LVSM通过解耦设计显著提升效率与性能，成为NVS领域的新标杆。

Abstract: Feedforward models for novel view synthesis (NVS) have recently advanced by transformer-based methods like LVSM, using attention among all input and target views. In this work, we argue that its full self-attention design is suboptimal, suffering from quadratic complexity with respect to the number of input views and rigid parameter sharing among heterogeneous tokens. We propose Efficient-LVSM, a dual-stream architecture that avoids these issues with a decoupled co-refinement mechanism. It applies intra-view self-attention for input views and self-then-cross attention for target views, eliminating unnecessary computation. Efficient-LVSM achieves 29.86 dB PSNR on RealEstate10K with 2 input views, surpassing LVSM by 0.2 dB, with 2x faster training convergence and 4.4x faster inference speed. Efficient-LVSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen view counts, and enables incremental inference with KV-cache, thanks to its decoupled designs.

TL;DR: 提出实例缺失的域自适应目标检测新问题，通过背景特征原型和关系一致性实现无目标实例的域对齐


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DAOD依赖目标域含前景实例的无标签数据，但实际场景中前景实例采集成本高，仅背景数据丰富，亟需无实例的域自适应方法

Method: 提出RSCN网络，利用背景特征原型进行域对齐，并保持源域前景与背景、目标域背景之间的关系一致性

Result: 在自动驾驶、野生动物和肺结节三个新基准上，RSCN显著超越现有DAOD方法

Conclusion: 实例缺失的域自适应检测是重要且可行的研究方向，RSCN为仅用背景数据实现高效域适配提供了新范式

Abstract: While Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) has made significant strides, most methods rely on unlabeled target data that is assumed to contain sufficient foreground instances. However, in many practical scenarios (e.g., wildlife monitoring, lesion detection), collecting target domain data with objects of interest is prohibitively costly, whereas background-only data is abundant. This common practical constraint introduces a significant technical challenge: the difficulty of achieving domain alignment when target instances are unavailable, forcing adaptation to rely solely on the target background information. We formulate this challenge as the novel problem of Instance-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection. To tackle this, we propose the Relational and Structural Consistency Network (RSCN) which pioneers an alignment strategy based on background feature prototypes while simultaneously encouraging consistency in the relationship between the source foreground features and the background features within each domain, enabling robust adaptation even without target instances. To facilitate research, we further curate three specialized benchmarks, including simulative auto-driving detection, wildlife detection, and lung nodule detection. Extensive experiments show that RSCN significantly outperforms existing DAOD methods across all three benchmarks in the instance-free scenario. The code and benchmarks will be released soon.

Abstract: Inferring the 3D structure from a single image, particularly in occluded regions, remains a fundamental yet unsolved challenge in vision-centric autonomous driving. Existing unsupervised approaches typically train a neural radiance field and treat the network outputs as occupancy probabilities during evaluation, overlooking the inconsistency between training and evaluation protocols. Moreover, the prevalent use of 2D ground truth fails to reveal the inherent ambiguity in occluded regions caused by insufficient geometric constraints. To address these issues, this paper presents a reformulated benchmark for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction. We first interpret the variables involved in the volume rendering process and identify the most physically consistent representation of the occupancy probability. Building on these analyses, we improve existing evaluation protocols by aligning the newly identified representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth, thereby enabling unsupervised methods to be evaluated in a manner consistent with that of supervised approaches. Additionally, to impose explicit constraints in occluded regions, we introduce an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism that incorporates multi-view visual cues to enhance discrimination between occupied and free spaces in these regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches but also matches the performance of supervised ones. Our source code and evaluation protocol will be made available upon publication.

Result: 在自建全景室内基准上，DreamHome-Pano在美学质量与结构一致性上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamHome-Pano提供了一种专业级、高保真的全景室内生成解决方案，有效平衡风格与结构约束。

Abstract: In modern interior design, the generation of personalized spaces frequently necessitates a delicate balance between rigid architectural structural constraints and specific stylistic preferences. However, existing multi-condition generative frameworks often struggle to harmonize these inputs, leading to "condition conflicts" where stylistic attributes inadvertently compromise the geometric precision of the layout. To address this challenge, we present DreamHome-Pano, a controllable panoramic generation framework designed for high-fidelity interior synthesis. Our approach introduces a Prompt-LLM that serves as a semantic bridge, effectively translating layout constraints and style references into professional descriptive prompts to achieve precise cross-modal alignment. To safeguard architectural integrity during the generative process, we develop a Conflict-Free Control architecture that incorporates structural-aware geometric priors and a multi-condition decoupling strategy, effectively suppressing stylistic interference from eroding the spatial layout. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive panoramic interior benchmark alongside a multi-stage training pipeline, encompassing progressive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experimental results demonstrate that DreamHome-Pano achieves a superior balance between aesthetic quality and structural consistency, offering a robust and professional-grade solution for panoramic interior visualization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有星载LiDAR数据稀疏且不确定性大，而机载LiDAR数据虽精细但覆盖有限，亟需一种可扩展的高分辨率冠层高度估算方法。

Method: 利用全球约16,000 km²机载LiDAR生成的冠层高度模型（CHM）和PlanetScope RGB影像训练Depth Anything V2模型，生成Depth2CHM模型，直接从卫星RGB影像估算连续CHM。

Result: 在中国（1 km²）和美国（116 km²）独立验证中，偏差分别为0.59 m和0.41 m，RMSE分别为2.54 m和5.75 m；相比现有全球产品，MAE降低约1.5 m，RMSE降低约2 m。

Conclusion: 基于大规模机载LiDAR训练的单目深度估计模型，为从卫星RGB影像实现高分辨率、连续森林冠层高度估算提供了高效、可扩展的新路径。

Abstract: Large-scale, high-resolution forest canopy height mapping plays a crucial role in understanding regional and global carbon and water cycles. Spaceborne LiDAR missions, including the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), provide global observations of forest structure but are spatially sparse and subject to inherent uncertainties. In contrast, near-surface LiDAR platforms, such as airborne and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR systems, offer much finer measurements of forest canopy structure, and a growing number of countries have made these datasets openly available. In this study, a state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation model, Depth Anything V2, was trained using approximately 16,000 km2 of canopy height models (CHMs) derived from publicly available airborne LiDAR point clouds and related products across multiple countries, together with 3 m resolution PlanetScope and airborne RGB imagery. The trained model, referred to as Depth2CHM, enables the estimation of spatially continuous CHMs directly from PlanetScope RGB imagery. Independent validation was conducted at sites in China (approximately 1 km2) and the United States (approximately 116 km2). The results showed that Depth2CHM could accurately estimate canopy height, with biases of 0.59 m and 0.41 m and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.54 m and 5.75 m for these two sites, respectively. Compared with an existing global meter-resolution CHM product, the mean absolute error is reduced by approximately 1.5 m and the RMSE by approximately 2 m. These results demonstrated that monocular depth estimation networks trained with large-scale airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height data provide a promising and scalable pathway for high-resolution, spatially continuous forest canopy height estimation from satellite RGB imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统像素方法依赖脆弱启发式规则或生成碎片化房间，难以处理复杂拓扑与几何约束。

Method: 采用pixels-to-sequence范式，直接输出结构化JSON序列；构建Floorplan-2M和Floorplan-HQ-300K数据集，结合SFT与GRPO进行渐进式训练。

Result: 在FPBench-2K上达到92.52%外墙IoU，显著优于现有方法，支持非曼哈顿架构泛化。

Conclusion: FloorplanVLM实现了平面图矢量化的高精度与全局一致性，为工程级应用提供新范式。

Abstract: Converting raster floorplans into engineering-grade vector graphics is challenging due to complex topology and strict geometric constraints. To address this, we present FloorplanVLM, a unified framework that reformulates floorplan vectorization as an image-conditioned sequence modeling task. Unlike pixel-based methods that rely on fragile heuristics or query-based transformers that generate fragmented rooms, our model directly outputs structured JSON sequences representing the global topology. This 'pixels-to-sequence' paradigm enables the precise and holistic constraint satisfaction of complex geometries, such as slanted walls and curved arcs. To support this data-hungry approach, we introduce a scalable data engine: we construct a large-scale dataset (Floorplan-2M) and a high-fidelity subset (Floorplan-HQ-300K) to balance geometric diversity and pixel-level precision. We then employ a progressive training strategy, using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) for structural grounding and quality annealing, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for strict geometric alignment. To standardize evaluation on complex layouts, we establish and open-source FPBench-2K. Evaluated on this rigorous benchmark, FloorplanVLM demonstrates exceptional structural validity, achieving $\textbf{92.52%}$ external-wall IoU and robust generalization across non-Manhattan architectures.

TL;DR: 提出MicroBi-ConvLSTM，一种仅11.4K参数的超轻量级卷积-循环模型，在保持高精度的同时显著降低内存占用，适合资源受限的可穿戴设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级模型（如TinierHAR和TinyHAR）虽准确率高，但在考虑操作系统开销后超出微控制器的SRAM内存预算。

Method: 采用两阶段卷积特征提取+4倍时间池化+单层双向LSTM，参数量平均仅11.4K，保持线性O(N)复杂度，并使用INT8量化进一步压缩。

Result: 在8个HAR基准上表现优异：UCI-HAR达93.41%、SKODA达94.46%、Daphnet达88.98%；INT8量化仅损失0.21% F1，部署体积仅23.0KB。

Conclusion: MicroBi-ConvLSTM在极低参数量下实现高精度，适合边缘设备部署，双向结构对事件检测更有效，周期性动作增益有限。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource constrained wearables requires models that balance accuracy against strict memory and computational budgets. State of the art lightweight architectures such as TinierHAR (34K parameters) and TinyHAR (55K parameters) achieve strong accuracy, but exceed memory budgets of microcontrollers with limited SRAM once operating system overhead is considered. We present MicroBi-ConvLSTM, an ultra-lightweight convolutional-recurrent architecture achieving 11.4K parameters on average through two stage convolutional feature extraction with 4x temporal pooling and a single bidirectional LSTM layer. This represents 2.9x parameter reduction versus TinierHAR and 11.9x versus DeepConvLSTM while preserving linear O(N) complexity. Evaluation across eight diverse HAR benchmarks shows that MicroBi-ConvLSTM maintains competitive performance within the ultra-lightweight regime: 93.41% macro F1 on UCI-HAR, 94.46% on SKODA assembly gestures, and 88.98% on Daphnet gait freeze detection. Systematic ablation reveals task dependent component contributions where bidirectionality benefits episodic event detection, but provides marginal gains on periodic locomotion. INT8 post training quantization incurs only 0.21% average F1-score degradation, yielding a 23.0 KB average deployment footprint suitable for memory constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: AdaptOVCD有效突破了传统变化检测对标注和类别预设的依赖，展现出强大的泛化能力与实用潜力。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection plays a pivotal role in domains such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, existing methods typically rely on predefined categories and large-scale pixel-level annotations, which limit their generalization and applicability in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AdaptOVCD, a training-free Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) architecture based on dual-dimensional multi-level information fusion. The framework integrates multi-level information fusion across data, feature, and decision levels vertically while incorporating targeted adaptive designs horizontally, achieving deep synergy among heterogeneous pre-trained models to effectively mitigate error propagation. Specifically, (1) at the data level, Adaptive Radiometric Alignment (ARA) fuses radiometric statistics with original texture features and synergizes with SAM-HQ to achieve radiometrically consistent segmentation; (2) at the feature level, Adaptive Change Thresholding (ACT) combines global difference distributions with edge structure priors and leverages DINOv3 to achieve robust change detection; (3) at the decision level, Adaptive Confidence Filtering (ACF) integrates semantic confidence with spatial constraints and collaborates with DGTRS-CLIP to achieve high-confidence semantic identification. Comprehensive evaluations across nine scenarios demonstrate that AdaptOVCD detects arbitrary category changes in a zero-shot manner, significantly outperforming existing training-free methods. Meanwhile, it achieves 84.89\% of the fully-supervised performance upper bound in cross-dataset evaluations and exhibits superior generalization capabilities.

Result: ForgeryEraser显著降低先进AIGC检测器性能，并使可解释模型对伪造图像产生与真图像一致的解释。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了基于VLM的AIGC检测器的系统性脆弱性，为未来检测器设计提供重要安全警示。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies poses significant challenges for authenticity assessment. However, existing evaluation protocols largely overlook anti-forensics attack, failing to ensure the comprehensive robustness of state-of-the-art AIGC detectors in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose ForgeryEraser, a framework designed to execute universal anti-forensics attack without access to the target AIGC detectors. We reveal an adversarial vulnerability stemming from the systemic reliance on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as shared backbones (e.g., CLIP), where downstream AIGC detectors inherit the feature space of these publicly accessible models. Instead of traditional logit-based optimization, we design a multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within the VLM feature space toward text-derived authentic anchors to erase forgery traces, while repelling them from forgery anchors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForgeryEraser causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks. Moreover, ForgeryEraser induces explainable forensic models to generate explanations consistent with authentic images for forged images. Our code will be made publicly available.

Result: 实现高压缩下的高保真重建，成功解耦运动与骨架结构，支持跨物种迁移、组合、去噪、生成和文本-运动检索

Conclusion: NEC构建了面向多样形态的统一运动分析与合成框架

Abstract: Motion tokenization is a key component of generalizable motion models, yet most existing approaches are restricted to species-specific skeletons, limiting their applicability across diverse morphologies. We propose NECromancer (NEC), a universal motion tokenizer that operates directly on arbitrary BVH skeletons. NEC consists of three components: (1) an Ontology-aware Skeletal Graph Encoder (OwO) that encodes structural priors from BVH files, including joint semantics, rest-pose offsets, and skeletal topology, into skeletal embeddings; (2) a Topology-Agnostic Tokenizer (TAT) that compresses motion sequences into a universal, topology-invariant discrete representation; and (3) the Unified BVH Universe (UvU), a large-scale dataset aggregating BVH motions across heterogeneous skeletons. Experiments show that NEC achieves high-fidelity reconstruction under substantial compression and effectively disentangles motion from skeletal structure. The resulting token space supports cross-species motion transfer, composition, denoising, generation with token-based models, and text-motion retrieval, establishing a unified framework for motion analysis and synthesis across diverse morphologies.

TL;DR: SPARC通过分离感知与推理模块，显著提升视觉语言模型在测试时的效率与准确性，且大幅降低token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在测试时扩展token预算时表现脆弱，感知与推理纠缠导致错误级联，且依赖昂贵的强化学习。

Method: 提出SPARC框架，采用两阶段流程：先进行显式视觉搜索定位相关区域，再基于这些区域进行推理，实现感知与推理的解耦。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准上超越单片模型和强视觉 grounding 方法，如在 V* VQA 上提升 Qwen3VL-4B 6.7 个百分点，且 token 预算降低 200 倍。

Conclusion: SPARC通过模块化设计实现高效、可扩展的视觉推理，为测试时计算分配与优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Despite recent successes, test-time scaling - i.e., dynamically expanding the token budget during inference as needed - remains brittle for vision-language models (VLMs): unstructured chains-of-thought about images entangle perception and reasoning, leading to long, disorganized contexts where small perceptual mistakes may cascade into completely wrong answers. Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses "thinking with images" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\times$ lower token budget.

Result: 在匹配误差和平滑性上表现优异，且比以往方法更具可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法为部分-部分3D形状匹配提供了高效、鲁棒的全新解决方案。

Abstract: The task of establishing correspondences between two 3D shapes is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While numerous studies address full-full and partial-full 3D shape matching, only a limited number of works have explored the partial-partial setting, very likely due to its unique challenges: we must compute accurate correspondences while at the same time find the unknown overlapping region. Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable. In this work, we introduce the first integer linear programming approach specifically designed to address the distinctive challenges of partial-partial shape matching. Our method leverages geometric consistency as a strong prior, enabling both robust estimation of the overlapping region and computation of neighbourhood-preserving correspondences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality matching results both in terms of matching error and smoothness. Moreover, we show that our method is more scalable than previous formalisms.

Result: 在ImageNet、CUB-200和Cars-196上达到与现有方法相当的分类精度和可解释性指标。

Conclusion: ProtoQuant实现了高效、稳定、可解释的原型建模，适用于大规模视觉识别任务。

Abstract: Prototypical parts-based models offer a "this looks like that" paradigm for intrinsic interpretability, yet they typically struggle with ImageNet-scale generalization and often require computationally expensive backbone finetuning. Furthermore, existing methods frequently suffer from "prototype drift," where learned prototypes lack tangible grounding in the training distribution and change their activation under small perturbations. We present ProtoQuant, a novel architecture that achieves prototype stability and grounded interpretability through latent vector quantization. By constraining prototypes to a discrete learned codebook within the latent space, we ensure they remain faithful representations of the training data without the need to update the backbone. This design allows ProtoQuant to function as an efficient, interpretable head that scales to large-scale datasets. We evaluate ProtoQuant on ImageNet and several fine-grained benchmarks (CUB-200, Cars-196). Our results demonstrate that ProtoQuant achieves competitive classification accuracy while generalizing to ImageNet and comparable interpretability metrics to other prototypical-parts-based methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a dominant architecture in computer vision, yet producing stable and high-resolution attribution maps for these models remains challenging. Architectural components such as patch embeddings and attention routing often introduce structured artifacts in pixel-level explanations, causing many existing methods to rely on coarse patch-level attributions. We introduce DAVE \textit{(\underline{D}istribution-aware \underline{A}ttribution via \underline{V}iT Gradient D\underline{E}composition)}, a mathematically grounded attribution method for ViTs based on a structured decomposition of the input gradient. By exploiting architectural properties of ViTs, DAVE isolates locally equivariant and stable components of the effective input--output mapping. It separates these from architecture-induced artifacts and other sources of instability.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition is a critical component for context-aware decision support in intelligent operating rooms, yet training robust models is hindered by limited annotated clinical videos and large domain gaps between synthetic and real surgical data. To address this, we propose CauCLIP, a causality-inspired vision-language framework that leverages CLIP to learn domain-invariant representations for surgical phase recognition without access to target domain data. Our approach integrates a frequency-based augmentation strategy to perturb domain-specific attributes while preserving semantic structures, and a causal suppression loss that mitigates non-causal biases and reinforces causal surgical features. These components are combined in a unified training framework that enables the model to focus on stable causal factors underlying surgical workflows. Experiments on the SurgVisDom hard adaptation benchmark demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms all competing approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of causality-guided vision-language models for domain-generalizable surgical video understanding.

Result: 实验揭示了当前多模态模型在计算机使用任务中的关键局限性与未来研究机会。

Conclusion: PlanViz为评估多模态模型在真实计算机使用场景中的能力提供了新工具，推动相关研究发展。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating natural images and supporting multimodal reasoning. However, their potential in supporting computer-use planning tasks, which are closely related to our lives, remain underexplored. Image generation and editing in computer-use tasks require capabilities like spatial reasoning and procedural understanding, and it is still unknown whether UMMs have these capabilities to finish these tasks or not. Therefore, we propose PlanViz, a new benchmark designed to evaluate image generation and editing for computer-use tasks. To achieve the goal of our evaluation, we focus on sub-tasks which frequently involve in daily life and require planning steps. Specifically, three new sub-tasks are designed: route planning, work diagramming, and web&UI displaying. We address challenges in data quality ensuring by curating human-annotated questions and reference images, and a quality control process. For challenges of comprehensive and exact evaluation, a task-adaptive score, PlanScore, is proposed. The score helps understanding the correctness, visual quality and efficiency of generated images. Through experiments, we highlight key limitations and opportunities for future research on this topic.

Conclusion: CytoCrowd是一个兼具标准任务评估与专家分歧建模能力的新型基准，推动下一代医学图像分析模型的发展。

Abstract: High-quality annotated datasets are crucial for advancing machine learning in medical image analysis. However, a critical gap exists: most datasets either offer a single, clean ground truth, which hides real-world expert disagreement, or they provide multiple annotations without a separate gold standard for objective evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce CytoCrowd, a new public benchmark for cytology analysis. The dataset features 446 high-resolution images, each with two key components: (1) raw, conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) a separate, high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by a senior expert. This dual structure makes CytoCrowd a versatile resource. It serves as a benchmark for standard computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification, using the ground truth. Simultaneously, it provides a realistic testbed for evaluating annotation aggregation algorithms that must resolve expert disagreements. We provide comprehensive baseline results for both tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the challenges presented by CytoCrowd and establish its value as a resource for developing the next generation of models for medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单体FID模型性能差，因子域间伪影异质性导致特征空间坍缩，亟需统一且判别性的特征重建方法。

Method: 提出Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA)，利用高层语义作为结构先验，约束重建统一且判别性伪影特征空间。

Result: 在OpenMMSec数据集上超越15种SOTA方法，特征空间近正交，验证语义先验有效性。

Conclusion: SICA是首个实用单体FID框架，证实语义先验可解决异质性导致的特征坍缩问题。

Abstract: Fake Image Detection (FID), aiming at unified detection across four image forensic subdomains, is critical in real-world forensic scenarios. Compared with ensemble approaches, monolithic FID models are theoretically more promising, but to date, consistently yield inferior performance in practice. In this work, by discovering the ``heterogeneous phenomenon'', which is the intrinsic distinctness of artifacts across subdomains, we diagnose the cause of this underperformance for the first time: the collapse of the artifact feature space driven by such phenomenon. The core challenge for developing a practical monolithic FID model thus boils down to the ``unified-yet-discriminative" reconstruction of the artifact feature space. To address this paradoxical challenge, we hypothesize that high-level semantics can serve as a structural prior for the reconstruction, and further propose Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA), the first monolithic FID paradigm. Extensive experiments on our OpenMMSec dataset demonstrate that SICA outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods and reconstructs the target unified-yet-discriminative artifact feature space in a near-orthogonal manner, thus firmly validating our hypothesis. The code and dataset are available at:https: //github.com/scu-zjz/SICA_OpenMMSec.

Result: 在真实非重复受试者基准上达到新SOTA，性能显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 为 scalable、非侵入式AIS评估提供了稳健、可解释且临床可信的解决方案

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent spinal deformity whose progression can be mitigated through early detection. Conventional screening methods are often subjective, difficult to scale, and reliant on specialized clinical expertise. Video-based gait analysis offers a promising alternative, but current datasets and methods frequently suffer from data leakage, where performance is inflated by repeated clips from the same individual, or employ oversimplified models that lack clinical interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce ScoliGait, a new benchmark dataset comprising 1,572 gait video clips for training and 300 fully independent clips for testing. Each clip is annotated with radiographic Cobb angles and descriptive text based on clinical kinematic priors. We propose a multi-modal framework that integrates a clinical-prior-guided kinematic knowledge map for interpretable feature representation, alongside a latent attention pooling mechanism to fuse video, text, and knowledge map modalities. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating a significant performance gap on a realistic, non-repeating subject benchmark. Our approach establishes a new state of the art, showing a significant performance gain on a realistic, subject-independent benchmark. This work provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically grounded foundation for scalable, non-invasive AIS assessment.

Conclusion: 基础模型表示方法可显著提升矿产勘探的效率、可扩展性与全球适用性。

Abstract: Satellite imagery is employed for large-scale prospectivity mapping due to the high cost and typically limited availability of on-site mineral exploration data. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept framework that leverages generative representations learned from multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery to identify gold-bearing regions from space. An autoencoder foundation model, called Isometric, which is pretrained on the large-scale FalconSpace-S2 v1.0 dataset, produces information-dense spectral-spatial representations that serve as inputs to a lightweight XGBoost classifier. We compare this representation-based approach with a raw spectral input baseline using a dataset of 63 Sentinel-2 images from known gold and non-gold locations. The proposed method improves patch-level accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 and image-level accuracy from 0.55 to 0.73, demonstrating that generative embeddings capture transferable mineralogical patterns even with limited labeled data. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model representations to make mineral exploration more efficient, scalable, and globally applicable.

Result: 通过初步实验验证了该方法能更丰富地描述情绪状态，并有效处理情绪感知的模糊性。

Conclusion: 该方法为情绪识别提供了新的研究方向，推动从离散分类向连续概率分布的范式转变。

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition has been typically cast as a single-label classification problem of one out of six prototypical emotions. However, that is an oversimplification that is unsuitable for representing the multifaceted spectrum of spontaneous emotional states, which are most often the result of a combination of multiple emotions contributing at different intensities. Building on this, a promising direction that was explored recently is to cast emotion recognition as a distribution learning problem. Still, such approaches are limited in that research datasets are typically annotated with a single emotion class. In this paper, we contribute a novel approach to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over a set of emotion classes. To do so, we propose a solution to automatically re-label existing datasets by exploiting the result of a study in which a large set of both basic and compound emotions is mapped to probability distributions in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. In this way, given a face image annotated with VAD values, we can estimate the likelihood of it belonging to each of the distributions, so that emotional states can be described as a mixture of emotions, enriching their description, while also accounting for the ambiguous nature of their perception. In a preliminary set of experiments, we illustrate the advantages of this solution and a new possible direction of investigation.

Conclusion: 计算机视觉方法可提供高效、客观、可扩展的评估工具，显著提升甘薯育种效率并助力粮食安全

Abstract: Sweetpotato weevils (Cylas spp.) are considered among the most destructive pests impacting sweetpotato production, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional methods for assessing weevil damage, predominantly relying on manual scoring, are labour-intensive, subjective, and often yield inconsistent results. These challenges significantly hinder breeding programs aimed at developing resilient sweetpotato varieties. This study introduces a computer vision-based approach for the automated evaluation of weevil damage in both field and laboratory contexts. In the field settings, we collected data to train classification models to predict root-damage severity levels, achieving a test accuracy of 71.43%. Additionally, we established a laboratory dataset and designed an object detection pipeline employing YOLO12, a leading real-time detection model. This methodology incorporated a two-stage laboratory pipeline that combined root segmentation with a tiling strategy to improve the detectability of small objects. The resulting model demonstrated a mean average precision of 77.7% in identifying minute weevil feeding holes. Our findings indicate that computer vision technologies can provide efficient, objective, and scalable assessment tools that align seamlessly with contemporary breeding workflows. These advancements represent a significant improvement in enhancing phenotyping efficiency within sweetpotato breeding programs and play a crucial role in mitigating the detrimental effects of weevils on food security.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注预定义的公平属性或主导属性，忽视了数据分布中被低估但存在于模型表征中的稀有社会、文化或风格属性。

Method: 采用Matryoshka稀疏自编码器与新颖的稀有性度量（结合神经元激活频率与语义独特性），识别揭示稀有属性的可解释神经元。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和SDXL中成功发现超出预设类别的稀有属性，支持跨架构审计，并能定向增强生成中的稀有特征。

Conclusion: RAIGen为扩散模型的偏见审计提供了新范式，可系统性挖掘和利用被忽视的语义多样性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but inherit and amplify training-data biases, skewing coverage of semantic attributes. Prior work addresses this in two ways. Closed-set approaches mitigate biases in predefined fairness categories (e.g., gender, race), assuming socially salient minority attributes are known a priori. Open-set approaches frame the task as bias identification, highlighting majority attributes that dominate outputs. Both overlook a complementary task: uncovering rare or minority features underrepresented in the data distribution (social, cultural, or stylistic) yet still encoded in model representations. We introduce RAIGen, the first framework, to our knowledge, for un-supervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models. RAIGen leverages Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric combining neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons whose top-activating images reveal underrepresented attributes. Experiments show RAIGen discovers attributes beyond fixed fairness categories in Stable Diffusion, scales to larger models such as SDXL, supports systematic auditing across architectures, and enables targeted amplification of rare attributes during generation.

Result: 在两种应用场景下均优于现有最优方法，实现更优的模型紧凑性与渲染质量平衡

Conclusion: GaussianPOP为3D高斯简化提供了首个基于视觉误差的 principled 解决方案，兼具精度与灵活性

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting simplification methods commonly use importance scores, such as blending weights or sensitivity, to identify redundant Gaussians. However, these scores are not driven by visual error metrics, often leading to suboptimal trade-offs between compactness and rendering fidelity. We present GaussianPOP, a principled simplification framework based on analytical Gaussian error quantification. Our key contribution is a novel error criterion, derived directly from the 3DGS rendering equation, that precisely measures each Gaussian's contribution to the rendered image. By introducing a highly efficient algorithm, our framework enables practical error calculation in a single forward pass. The framework is both accurate and flexible, supporting on-training pruning as well as post-training simplification via iterative error re-quantification for improved stability. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pruning methods across both application scenarios, achieving a superior trade-off between model compactness and high rendering quality.

Result: PKA实现10.0×推理速度提升和5.1×显存节省，同时保持高保真多条件生成质量。

Conclusion: PKA通过消除跨模态冗余交互，为高效、可扩展的多条件图像生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: While modern text-to-image models excel at prompt-based generation, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary for specific user requirements like spatial layouts or subject appearances. Multi-condition control addresses this, yet its integration into Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the conventional ``concatenate-and-attend'' strategy, which suffers from quadratic computational and memory overhead as the number of conditions scales. Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity. Empirically, PKA delivers a 10.0$\times$ inference speedup and a 5.1$\times$ VRAM saving, providing a scalable and resource-friendly solution for high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation.

Result: 在语义分割、目标检测、实例分割和全景分割等任务上表现优越。

Conclusion: AdaRoute通过隐式跨层特征交互提升特征多样性，实现高效且强大的适配能力。

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained vision models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) remains challenging, as it aims to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning using a minimal number of trainable parameters. When applied to complex dense prediction tasks, existing methods exhibit limitations, including input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations. To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdaRoute on diverse vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法依赖固定长度输入且计算开销大，而自回归视频生成在变长编辑中未被充分探索。

Method: 基于2D图像到图像扩散模型，引入残差流扩散模型（RFDM），通过条件化前一帧预测并建模帧间残差实现高效视频编辑。

Result: RFDM在风格迁移和物体移除任务上超越基于图像的方法，接近3D视频模型效果，且计算量与视频长度无关。

Conclusion: RFDM实现了高效、可扩展的文本驱动视频编辑，为变长视频编辑提供了新范式。

Abstract: Instructional video editing applies edits to an input video using only text prompts, enabling intuitive natural-language control. Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models continue to improve in visual quality, their increasing scale has widened the gap between state-of-the-art models and on-device solutions. To address this gap, we introduce NanoFLUX, a 2.4B text-to-image flow-matching model distilled from 17B FLUX.1-Schnell using a progressive compression pipeline designed to preserve generation quality. Our contributions include: (1) A model compression strategy driven by pruning redundant components in the diffusion transformer, reducing its size from 12B to 2B; (2) A ResNet-based token downsampling mechanism that reduces latency by allowing intermediate blocks to operate on lower-resolution tokens while preserving high-resolution processing elsewhere; (3) A novel text encoder distillation approach that leverages visual signals from early layers of the denoiser during sampling. Empirically, NanoFLUX generates 512 x 512 images in approximately 2.5 seconds on mobile devices, demonstrating the feasibility of high-quality on-device text-to-image generation.

Result: 在GenEval、DPG和T2I-CompBench++上显著提升指令遵循能力、偏好、美感和整体生成质量。

Conclusion: 提示遗忘是MMDiTs的关键瓶颈，prompt reinjection是一种高效且通用的解决策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiTs) for text-to-image generation maintain separate text and image branches, with bidirectional information flow between text tokens and visual latents throughout denoising. In this setting, we observe a prompt forgetting phenomenon: the semantics of the prompt representation in the text branch is progressively forgotten as depth increases. We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting. Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent gains in instruction-following capability, along with improvements on metrics capturing preference, aesthetics, and overall text--image generation quality.

Conclusion: PANC通过极少量标注实现高稳定性、强可控性和优异分割效果，尤其适用于标注昂贵或类内差异细微的场景。

Abstract: Fully unsupervised segmentation pipelines naively seek the most salient object, should this be present. As a result, most of the methods reported in the literature deliver non-deterministic partitions that are sensitive to initialization, seed order, and threshold heuristics.
  We propose PANC, a weakly supervised spectral segmentation framework that uses a minimal set of annotated visual tokens to produce stable, controllable, and reproducible object masks. From the TokenCut approach, we augment the token-token affinity graph with a handful of priors coupled to anchor nodes. By manipulating the graph topology, we bias the spectral eigenspace toward partitions that are consistent with the annotations. Our approach preserves the global grouping enforced by dense self-supervised visual features, trading annotated tokens for significant gains in reproducibility, user control, and segmentation quality.
  Using 5 to 30 annotations per dataset, our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly and unsupervised approaches on standard benchmarks (e.g., DUTS-TE, ECSSD, MS COCO). Contrarily, it excels in domains where dense labels are costly or intra-class differences are subtle. We report strong and reliable results on homogeneous, fine-grained, and texture-limited domains, achieving 96.8% (+14.43% over SotA), 78.0% (+0.2%), and 78.8% (+0.37%) average mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on CrackForest (CFD), CUB-200-2011, and HAM10000 datasets, respectively. For multi-object benchmarks, the framework showcases explicit, user-controllable semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 研究视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）在细粒度视觉任务中表现不佳的原因，发现视觉信息压缩与任务复杂度相关，高复杂度数据训练可改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLLMs在需要细粒度视觉信息或空间推理的任务中表现差，但原因不明，有人推测是视觉冗余导致细粒度信息丢失。

Method: 构建合成基准数据集，设计视觉冗余度量指标，通过微调VLLMs于复杂视觉任务，分析视觉压缩行为随数据复杂度的变化。

Result: 发现任务复杂度与视觉压缩密切相关，充足高复杂度视觉数据能改变模型的视觉表征分布，提升复杂视觉任务表现。

Conclusion: 训练下一代VLLMs应注重引入足够高复杂度的视觉数据，以优化视觉信息的编码与利用。

Abstract: Vision capabilities in vision large language models (VLLMs) have consistently lagged behind their linguistic capabilities. In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights for training the next generation of VLLMs.

Method: 设计错误标注检测框架，并在Video Capsule Endoscopy两个公开数据集上验证，由专家复核修正标注

Result: 成功识别错误标注，数据清洗后异常检测性能优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升医学图像数据质量，为低质量标注场景提供实用解决方案

Abstract: The classification performance of deep neural networks relies strongly on access to large, accurately annotated datasets. In medical imaging, however, obtaining such datasets is particularly challenging since annotations must be provided by specialized physicians, which severely limits the pool of annotators. Furthermore, class boundaries can often be ambiguous or difficult to define which further complicates machine learning-based classification. In this paper, we want to address this problem and introduce a framework for mislabel detection in medical datasets. This is validated on the two largest, publicly available datasets for Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important imaging procedure for examining the gastrointestinal tract based on a video stream of lowresolution images. In addition, potentially mislabeled samples identified by our pipeline were reviewed and re-annotated by three experienced gastroenterologists. Our results show that the proposed framework successfully detects incorrectly labeled data and results in an improved anomaly detection performance after cleaning the datasets compared to current baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实拍成本高，需搭建物理场景，亟需一种能基于静态场景图像生成动态电影视频的低成本方法。

Method: CineScene通过VGGT编码静态场景图像为3D感知特征，注入预训练文本到视频模型，结合上下文拼接与随机打乱策略，实现相机控制的视频合成。

Result: 在自建的Unreal Engine 5数据集上达到SOTA，支持大范围相机运动，泛化性强，场景一致性高。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解耦场景与主体，为低成本电影级视频生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Cinematic video production requires control over scene-subject composition and camera movement, but live-action shooting remains costly due to the need for constructing physical sets. To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.

Method: 采用多阶段训练：跨模态预训练、多任务指令微调（含caption、VQA、报告生成、定位等）、基于事实性检查和GIoU奖励的强化学习。

Conclusion: MedMO是首个在医学多模态任务中实现高精度空间推理与跨模态泛化的开源基础模型，具有显著临床潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced, yet their adoption in medicine remains limited by gaps in domain coverage, modality alignment, and grounded reasoning. In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy. Moreover, it exhibits strong grounding capability, achieving an IoU improvement of +40.4 over the baseline and +37.0% over Fleming-VL, underscoring its robust spatial reasoning and localization performance. Evaluations across radiology, ophthalmology, and pathology-microscopy confirm MedMO's broad cross-modality generalization. We release two versions of MedMO: 4B and 8B.

Conclusion: EUGens为大规模神经网络在真实场景中的可扩展部署提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 该研究为柔性连接AUV系统的结构设计、优化与控制提供了理论基础。

Abstract: This research presents a dynamic modeling framework and parameter identification methods for describing the highly nonlinear behaviors of flexibly connected dual-AUV systems. The modeling framework is established based on the lumped mass method, integrating axial elasticity, bending stiffness, added mass and hydrodynamic forces, thereby accurately capturing the time-varying response of the forces and cable configurations. To address the difficulty of directly measuring material-related and hydrodynamic coefficients, this research proposes a parameter identification method that combines the physical model with experimental data. High-precision inversion of the equivalent Youngs modulus and hydrodynamic coefficients is performed through tension experiments under multiple configurations, effectively demonstrating that the identified model maintains predictive consistency in various operational conditions. Further numerical analysis indicates that the dynamic properties of flexible cable exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics, which are highly dependent on material property variations and AUV motion conditions. This nonlinear dynamic behavior results in two typical response states, slack and taut, which are jointly determined by boundary conditions and hydrodynamic effects, significantly affecting the cable configuration and endpoint loads. In this research, the dynamics of flexible cables under complex boundary conditions is revealed, providing a theoretical foundation for the design, optimization and further control research of similar systems.

Conclusion: Transformer-based POMDP架构为复杂空间环境下的自主避碰提供了新的可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce a Transformer-based Reinforcement Learning framework for autonomous orbital collision avoidance that explicitly models the effects of partial observability and imperfect monitoring in space operations. The framework combines a configurable encounter simulator, a distance-dependent observation model, and a sequential state estimator to represent uncertainty in relative motion. A central contribution of this work is the use of transformer-based Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) architecture, which leverage long-range temporal attention to interpret noisy and intermittent observations more effectively than traditional architectures. This integration provides a foundation for training collision avoidance agents that can operate more reliably under imperfect monitoring environments.

Abstract: We study localization and control for unstable systems under coarse, single-bit sensing. Motivated by understanding the fundamental limitations imposed by such minimal feedback, we identify sufficient conditions under which the initial state can be recovered despite instability and extremely sparse measurements. Building on these conditions, we develop an active localization algorithm that integrates a set-based estimator with a control strategy derived from Voronoi partitions, which provably estimates the initial state while ensuring the agent remains in informative regions. Under the derived conditions, the proposed approach guarantees exponential contraction of the initial-state uncertainty, and the result is further supported by numerical experiments. These findings can offer theoretical insight into localization in robotics, where sensing is often limited to coarse abstractions such as keyframes, segmentations, or line-based features.

Result: 体外实验证实PI薄膜模量约20 MPa，展开角稳定在34°；猪体实验显示穿刺深度中位数为0.61 mm，胃和肠组织活检产量分别达10.9 mg和18.9 mg，与传统钳夹活检相当，且作用力在安全范围内。

Conclusion: Kiri-Capsule首次实现了可吞咽、深度可控、组织病理学兼容的活检功能，推动胶囊诊断从被动成像迈向主动取样，具有重要临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) has transformed gastrointestinal (GI) diagnostics by enabling noninvasive visualization of the digestive tract, yet its diagnostic yield remains constrained by the absence of biopsy capability, as histological analysis is still the gold standard for confirming disease. Conventional biopsy using forceps, needles, or rotating blades is invasive, limited in reach, and carries risks of perforation or mucosal trauma, while fluid- or microbiota-sampling capsules cannot provide structured tissue for pathology, leaving a critical gap in swallowable biopsy solutions. Here we present the Kiri-Capsule, a kirigami-inspired capsule robot that integrates deployable PI-film flaps actuated by a compact dual-cam mechanism to achieve minimally invasive and repeatable tissue collection. The kirigami surface remains flat during locomotion but transforms into sharp protrusions upon cam-driven stretching, enabling controlled penetration followed by rotary scraping, with specimens retained in internal fan-shaped cavities. Bench tests confirmed that PI films exhibit a Young's modulus of approximately 20 MPa and stable deployment angles (about 34$^\circ$ at 15% strain), while ex vivo porcine studies demonstrated shallow penetration depths (median $\sim$0.61 mm, range 0.46--0.66 mm) and biopsy yields comparable to standard forceps (mean $\sim$10.9 mg for stomach and $\sim$18.9 mg for intestine), with forces within safe ranges reported for GI biopsy. These findings demonstrate that the Kiri-Capsule bridges passive imaging and functional biopsy, providing a swallowable, depth-controlled, and histology-ready solution that advances capsule-based diagnostics toward safe and effective clinical application.

Abstract: World models offer a promising avenue for more faithfully capturing complex dynamics, including contacts and non-rigidity, as well as complex sensory information, such as visual perception, in situations where standard simulators struggle. However, these models are computationally complex to evaluate, posing a challenge for popular RL approaches that have been successfully used with simulators to solve complex locomotion tasks but yet struggle with manipulation. This paper introduces a method that bypasses simulators entirely, training RL policies inside world models learned from robots' interactions with real environments. At its core, our approach enables policy training with large-scale diffusion models via a novel decoupled first-order gradient (FoG) method: a full-scale world model generates accurate forward trajectories, while a lightweight latent-space surrogate approximates its local dynamics for efficient gradient computation. This coupling of a local and global world model ensures high-fidelity unrolling alongside computationally tractable differentiation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on the Push-T manipulation task, where it significantly outperforms PPO in sample efficiency. We further evaluate our approach through an ego-centric object manipulation task with a quadruped. Together, these results demonstrate that learning inside data-driven world models is a promising pathway for solving hard-to-model RL tasks in image space without reliance on hand-crafted physics simulators.

Abstract: People with lower and upper body disabilities can benefit from wheelchairs and robotic arms to improve mobility and independence. Prior assistive interfaces, such as touchscreens and voice-driven predefined commands, often remain unintuitive and struggle to capture complex user intent. We propose a natural, dialogue based human robot interaction protocol that simulates an intelligent agent capable of communicating with users to understand intent and execute assistive actions. In a pilot study, five participants completed five assistive tasks (cleaning, drinking, feeding, drawer opening, and door opening) through dialogue-based interaction with a wheelchair and robotic arm. As a baseline, participants were required to open a door using the manual control (a wheelchair joystick and a game controller for the arm) and complete a questionnaire to gather their feedback. By analyzing the post-study questionnaires, we found that most participants enjoyed the dialogue-based interaction and assistive robot autonomy.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Mechacnially prOgrammed Radius-adjustable PHysical (MORPH) wheel, a fully passive variable-radius wheel that embeds mechanical behavior logic for torque-responsive transformation. Unlike conventional variable transmission systems relying on actuators, sensors, and active control, the MORPH wheel achieves passive adaptation solely through its geometry and compliant structure. The design integrates a torque-response coupler and spring-loaded connecting struts to mechanically adjust the wheel radius between 80 mm and 45 mm in response to input torque, without any electrical components. The MORPH wheel provides three unique capabilities rarely achieved simultaneously in previous passive designs: (1) bidirectional operation with unlimited rotation through a symmetric coupler; (2) high torque capacity exceeding 10 N with rigid power transmission in drive mode; and (3) precise and repeatable transmission ratio control governed by deterministic kinematics. A comprehensive analytical model was developed to describe the wheel's mechanical behavior logic, establishing threshold conditions for mode switching between direct drive and radius transformation. Experimental validation confirmed that the measured torque-radius and force-displacement characteristics closely follow theoretical predictions across wheel weights of 1.8-2.8kg. Robot-level demonstrations on varying loads (0-25kg), slopes, and unstructured terrains further verified that the MORPH wheel passively adjusts its radius to provide optimal transmission ratio. The MORPH wheel exemplifies a mechanically programmed structure, embedding intelligent, context-dependent behavior directly into its physical design. This approach offers a new paradigm for passive variable transmission and mechanical intelligence in robotic mobility systems operating in unpredictable or control-limited environments.

Abstract: Validating Augmented Reality (AR) tracking and interaction models requires precise, repeatable ground-truth motion. However, human users cannot reliably perform consistent motion due to biomechanical variability. Robotic manipulators are promising to act as human motion proxies if they can mimic human movements. In this work, we design and implement ARBot, a real-time teleoperation platform that can effectively capture natural human motion and accurately replay the movements via robotic manipulators. ARBot includes two capture models: stable wrist motion capture via a custom CV and IMU pipeline, and natural 6-DOF control via a mobile application. We design a proactively-safe QP controller to ensure smooth, jitter-free execution of the robotic manipulator, enabling it to function as a high-fidelity record and replay physical proxy. We open-source ARBot and release a benchmark dataset of 132 human and synthetic trajectories captured using ARBot to support controllable and scalable AR evaluation.

Abstract: Constraining motion to a flat surface is a fundamental requirement for equipment across science and engineering. Modern precision robotic motion systems, such as gantries, rely on the flatness of components, including guide rails and granite surface plates. However, translating this static flatness into motion requires precise internal alignment and tight-tolerance components that create long, error-sensitive reference chains. Here, we show that by using the geometric inversion of a sphere into a plane, we can produce robotic motion systems that derive planarity entirely from link lengths and connectivity. This allows planar motion to emerge from self-referencing geometric constraints, and without external metrology. We demonstrate these Flat-Plane Mechanisms (FPMs) from micron to meter scales and show that fabrication errors can be attenuated by an order of magnitude in the resulting flatness. Finally, we present a robotic FPM-based 3-axis positioning system that can be used for metrology surface scans ($\pm 12$-mm) and 3D printing inside narrow containers. This work establishes an alternative geometric foundation for planar motion that can be realized across size scales and opens new possibilities in metrology, fabrication, and micro-positioning.

Result: 六边形网格仿真中实现了类肢延伸、自分裂和断后再生，边界作为信息熵sink维持动态平衡

Conclusion: 仅需内部规则即可涌现复杂形态行为，为开发高效、生物可信的自修复自治硬件提供新框架

Abstract: This study presents an internalized morphogenesis model for autonomous systems, such as swarm robotics and micro-nanomachines, that eliminates the need for external spatial computation. Traditional self-organizing models often require calculations across the entire coordinate space, including empty areas, which is impractical for resource-constrained physical modules. Our proposed model achieves complex morphogenesis through strictly local interactions between adjacent modules within the "body." By extending the "Ishida token model," modules exchange integer values using an RD-inspired discrete analogue without solving differential equations. The internal potential, derived from token accumulation and aging, guides autonomous growth, shrinkage, and replication. Simulations on a hexagonal grid demonstrated the emergence of limb-like extensions, self-division, and robust regeneration capabilities following structural amputation. A key feature is the use of the body boundary as a natural sink for information entropy (tokens) to maintain a dynamic equilibrium. These results indicate that sophisticated morphological behaviors can emerge from minimal, internal-only rules. This framework offers a computationally efficient and biologically plausible approach to developing self-repairing, adaptive, and autonomous hardware.

Abstract: Robot Foundation Models such as Vision-Language-Action models are rapidly reshaping how robot policies are trained and deployed, replacing hand-designed planners with end-to-end generative action models. While these systems demonstrate impressive generalization, it remains unclear whether they fundamentally resolve the long-standing challenges of robotics. We address this question by analyzing action hallucinations that violate physical constraints and their extension to plan-level failures. Focusing on latent-variable generative policies, we show that hallucinations often arise from structural mismatches between feasible robot behavior and common model architectures. We study three such barriers -- topological, precision, and horizon -- and show how they impose unavoidable tradeoffs. Our analysis provides mechanistic explanations for reported empirical failures of generative robot policies and suggests principled directions for improving reliability and trustworthiness, without abandoning their expressive power.

Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation requires executing precise manipulation tasks while maintaining dynamic stability amid base motion and impacts. Existing approaches typically formulate commands in body-centric frames, fail to inherently correct cumulative world-frame drift induced by legged locomotion. We reformulate the problem as world-frame end-effector tracking and propose HiWET, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that decouples global reasoning from dynamic execution. The high-level policy generates subgoals that jointly optimize end-effector accuracy and base positioning in the world frame, while the low-level policy executes these commands under stability constraints. We introduce a Kinematic Manifold Prior (KMP) that embeds the manipulation manifold into the action space via residual learning, reducing exploration dimensionality and mitigating kinematically invalid behaviors. Extensive simulation and ablation studies demonstrate that HiWET achieves precise and stable end-effector tracking in long-horizon world-frame tasks. We validate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of the low-level policy on a physical humanoid, demonstrating stable locomotion under diverse manipulation commands. These results indicate that explicit world-frame reasoning combined with hierarchical control provides an effective and scalable solution for long-horizon humanoid loco-manipulation.

Conclusion: BudVLN通过保持指令与状态语义一致性，为视觉语言导航提供了更稳健的在线学习范式。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) requires embodied agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through complex continuous 3D environments. However, the dominant imitation learning paradigm suffers from exposure bias, where minor deviations during inference lead to compounding errors. While DAgger-style approaches attempt to mitigate this by correcting error states, we identify a critical limitation: Instruction-State Misalignment. Forcing an agent to learn recovery actions from off-track states often creates supervision signals that semantically conflict with the original instruction. In response to these challenges, we introduce BudVLN, an online framework that learns from on-policy rollouts by constructing supervision to match the current state distribution. BudVLN performs retrospective rectification via counterfactual re-anchoring and decision-conditioned supervision synthesis, using a geodesic oracle to synthesize corrective trajectories that originate from valid historical states, ensuring semantic consistency. Experiments on the standard R2R-CE and RxR-CE benchmarks demonstrate that BudVLN consistently mitigates distribution shift and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both Success Rate and SPL.

Abstract: Embodied agents struggle to generalize to new environments, even when those environments share similar underlying structures to their training settings. Most current approaches to generating these training environments follow an open-loop paradigm, without considering the agent's current performance. While procedural generation methods can produce diverse scenes, diversity without feedback from the agent is inefficient. The generated environments may be trivially easy, providing limited learning signal. To address this, we present a proof-of-concept for closed-loop environment generation that adapts difficulty to the agent's current capabilities. Our system employs a controllable environment representation, extracts fine-grained performance feedback beyond binary success or failure, and implements a closed-loop adaptation mechanism that translates this feedback into environment modifications. This feedback-driven approach generates training environments that more challenging in the ways the agent needs to improve, enabling more efficient learning and better generalization to novel settings.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D LiDAR has emerged as a cornerstone for autonomous navigation in robotics. While feature-based SLAM systems have achieved impressive results by leveraging edge and planar structures, they often suffer from the inconsistent estimator associated with feature parameterization and estimated covariance. In this work, we present a consistency-improved LiDAR-inertial bundle adjustment (BA) with tailored parameterization and estimator. First, we propose a stereographic-projection representation parameterizing the planar and edge features, and conduct a comprehensive observability analysis to support its integrability with consistent estimator. Second, we implement a LiDAR-inertial BA with Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) formulation and First-Estimate Jacobians (FEJ) to preserve the accurate estimated covariance and observability properties of the system. Last, we apply our proposed BA method to a LiDAR-inertial odometry.

Abstract: Achieving robust vision-based humanoid locomotion remains challenging due to two fundamental issues: the sim-to-real gap introduces significant perception noise that degrades performance on fine-grained tasks, and training a unified policy across diverse terrains is hindered by conflicting learning objectives. To address these challenges, we present an end-to-end framework for vision-driven humanoid locomotion. For robust sim-to-real transfer, we develop a high-fidelity depth sensor simulation that captures stereo matching artifacts and calibration uncertainties inherent in real-world sensing. We further propose a vision-aware behavior distillation approach that combines latent space alignment with noise-invariant auxiliary tasks, enabling effective knowledge transfer from privileged height maps to noisy depth observations. For versatile terrain adaptation, we introduce terrain-specific reward shaping integrated with multi-critic and multi-discriminator learning, where dedicated networks capture the distinct dynamics and motion priors of each terrain type. We validate our approach on two humanoid platforms equipped with different stereo depth cameras. The resulting policy demonstrates robust performance across diverse environments, seamlessly handling extreme challenges such as high platforms and wide gaps, as well as fine-grained tasks including bidirectional long-term staircase traversal.

Conclusion: ECO提供了一种可解释、易调参的能量优化新范式，推动人形机器人高效节能运动的发展。

Abstract: Achieving stable and energy-efficient locomotion is essential for humanoid robots to operate continuously in real-world applications. Existing MPC and RL approaches often rely on energy-related metrics embedded within a multi-objective optimization framework, which require extensive hyperparameter tuning and often result in suboptimal policies. To address these challenges, we propose ECO (Energy-Constrained Optimization), a constrained RL framework that separates energy-related metrics from rewards, reformulating them as explicit inequality constraints. This method provides a clear and interpretable physical representation of energy costs, enabling more efficient and intuitive hyperparameter tuning for improved energy efficiency. ECO introduces dedicated constraints for energy consumption and reference motion, enforced by the Lagrangian method, to achieve stable, symmetric, and energy-efficient walking for humanoid robots. We evaluated ECO against MPC, standard RL with reward shaping, and four state-of-the-art constrained RL methods. Experiments, including sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfers on the kid-sized humanoid robot BRUCE, demonstrate that ECO significantly reduces energy consumption compared to baselines while maintaining robust walking performance. These results highlight a substantial advancement in energy-efficient humanoid locomotion.

Conclusion: 用户习惯是提升家庭环境物体导航性能的关键因素，UcON为个性化导航研究提供了新范式。

Abstract: In the evolving field of robotics, the challenge of Object Navigation (ON) in household environments has attracted significant interest. Existing ON benchmarks typically place objects in locations guided by general scene priors, without accounting for the specific placement habits of individual users. This omission limits the adaptability of navigation agents in personalized household environments. To address this, we introduce User-centric Object Navigation (UcON), a new benchmark that incorporates user-specific object placement habits, referred to as user habits. This benchmark requires agents to leverage these user habits for more informed decision-making during navigation. UcON encompasses approximately 22,600 user habits across 489 object categories. UcON is, to our knowledge, the first benchmark that explicitly formalizes and evaluates habit-conditioned object navigation at scale and covers the widest range of target object categories. Additionally, we propose a habit retrieval module to extract and utilize habits related to target objects, enabling agents to infer their likely locations more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that current SOTA methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under habit-driven object placement, while integrating user habits consistently improves success rates.

Abstract: Vision-based models for robotic grasping automate critical, repetitive, and draining industrial tasks. Existing approaches are typically limited in two ways: they either target a single gripper and are potentially applied on costly dual-arm setups, or rely on custom hybrid grippers that require ad-hoc learning procedures with logic that cannot be transferred across tasks, restricting their general applicability. In this work, we present MultiGraspNet, a novel multitask 3D deep learning method that predicts feasible poses simultaneously for parallel and vacuum grippers within a unified framework, enabling a single robot to handle multiple end effectors. The model is trained on the richly annotated GraspNet-1Billion and SuctionNet-1Billion datasets, which have been aligned for the purpose, and generates graspability masks quantifying the suitability of each scene point for successful grasps. By sharing early-stage features while maintaining gripper-specific refiners, MultiGraspNet effectively leverages complementary information across grasping modalities, enhancing robustness and adaptability in cluttered scenes. We characterize MultiGraspNet's performance with an extensive experimental analysis, demonstrating its competitiveness with single-task models on relevant benchmarks. We run real-world experiments on a single-arm multi-gripper robotic setup showing that our approach outperforms the vacuum baseline, grasping 16% percent more seen objects and 32% more of the novel ones, while obtaining competitive results for the parallel task.

Abstract: Recent progress in robotic world models has leveraged video diffusion transformers to predict future observations conditioned on historical states and actions. While these models can simulate realistic visual outcomes, they often exhibit poor action-following precision, hindering their utility for downstream robotic learning. In this work, we introduce World-VLA-Loop, a closed-loop framework for the joint refinement of world models and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies. We propose a state-aware video world model that functions as a high-fidelity interactive simulator by jointly predicting future observations and reward signals. To enhance reliability, we introduce the SANS dataset, which incorporates near-success trajectories to improve action-outcome alignment within the world model. This framework enables a closed-loop for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of VLA policies entirely within a virtual environment. Crucially, our approach facilitates a co-evolving cycle: failure rollouts generated by the VLA policy are iteratively fed back to refine the world model precision, which in turn enhances subsequent RL optimization. Evaluations across simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly boosts VLA performance with minimal physical interaction, establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between world modeling and policy learning for general-purpose robotics.

Abstract: While generalist robot policies hold significant promise for learning diverse manipulation skills through imitation, their performance is often hindered by the long-tail distribution of training demonstrations. Policies learned on such data, which is heavily skewed towards a few data-rich head tasks, frequently exhibit poor generalization when confronted with the vast number of data-scarce tail tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the pervasive long-tail challenge inherent in policy learning. Our analysis begins by demonstrating the inefficacy of conventional long-tail learning strategies (e.g., re-sampling) for improving the policy's performance on tail tasks. We then uncover the underlying mechanism for this failure, revealing that data scarcity on tail tasks directly impairs the policy's spatial reasoning capability. To overcome this, we introduce Approaching-Phase Augmentation (APA), a simple yet effective scheme that transfers knowledge from data-rich head tasks to data-scarce tail tasks without requiring external demonstrations. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of APA. Our code and demos are publicly available at: https://mldxy.github.io/Project-VLA-long-tail/.

Abstract: Robotic-assisted surgery has emerged as a promising approach to improve surgical ergonomics, precision, and workflow efficiency, particularly in complex procedures such as cervical spine surgery. In this study, we evaluate the performance of a collaborative robotic system designed to assist surgeons in drilling tasks by assessing its accuracy in executing predefined trajectories. A total of 14 drillings were performed by eight experienced cervical surgeons, utilizing a robotic-assisted setup aimed at ensuring stability and alignment. The primary objective of this study is to quantify the deviations in the position and orientation of the drilling tool relative to the planned trajectory, providing insights into the system's reliability and potential impact on clinical outcomes. While the primary function of robotic assistance in surgery is to enhance surgeon comfort and procedural guidance rather than solely optimizing precision, understanding the system's accuracy remains crucial for its effective integration into surgical practices part of this primary experimental feedback, the study offers an in-depth analysis of the co-manipulated robotic system's performance, focusing on the experimental setup and error evaluation methods. The findings of this study will contribute to the ongoing development of robotic-assisted cervical surgery, highlighting both its advantages and areas for improvement in achieving safer and more efficient surgical workflows

Abstract: Autonomous agents that perform everyday manipulation actions need to ensure that their body motions are semantically correct with respect to a task request, causally effective within their environment, and feasible for their embodiment. In order to enable robots to verify these properties, we introduce the Law of Task-Achieving Body Motion as an axiomatic correctness specification for body motions. To that end we introduce scoped Task-Environment-Embodiment (TEE) classes that represent world states as Semantic Digital Twins (SDTs) and define applicable physics models to decompose task achievement into three predicates: SatisfiesRequest for semantic request satisfaction over SDT state evolution; Causes for causal sufficiency under the scoped physics model; and CanPerform for safety and feasibility verification at the embodiment level. This decomposition yields a reusable, implementation-independent interface that supports motion synthesis and the verification of given body motions. It also supports typed failure diagnosis (semantic, causal, embodiment and out-of-scope), feasibility across robots and environments, and counterfactual reasoning about robot body motions. We demonstrate the usability of the law in practice by instantiating it for articulated container manipulation in kitchen environments on three contrasting mobile manipulation platforms

Conclusion: 文本标记化本体感觉的早期融合显著提升VLA模型效率与决策准确性，是高效具身智能的有效路径。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models typically inject proprioception only as a late conditioning signal, which prevents robot state from shaping instruction understanding and from influencing which visual tokens are attended throughout the policy. We introduce ThinkProprio, which converts proprioception into a sequence of text tokens in the VLM embedding space and fuses them with the task instruction at the input. This early fusion lets embodied state participate in subsequent visual reasoning and token selection, biasing computation toward action-critical evidence while suppressing redundant visual tokens. In a systematic ablation over proprioception encoding, state entry point, and action-head conditioning, we find that text tokenization is more effective than learned projectors, and that retaining roughly 15% of visual tokens can match the performance of using the full token set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 接触密集任务中，位置轨迹易得但力命令未知，现有预训练模型因硬件依赖难以直接应用。

Method: 构建无记忆的力生成模型，并引入反馈控制机制以处理未见轨迹，避免有记忆模型导致的反馈不稳定。

Result: 该方法在未知轨迹下能稳定生成准确力命令，显著提升机器人书写任务的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 无记忆力生成模型与反馈控制结合，是实现跨任务力控制泛化的有效方案。

Abstract: In contact-rich tasks, while position trajectories are often easy to obtain, appropriate force commands are typically unknown. Although it is conceivable to generate force commands using a pretrained foundation model such as Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, force control is highly dependent on the specific hardware of the robot, which makes the application of such models challenging. To bridge this gap, we propose a force generative model that estimates force commands from given position trajectories. However, when dealing with unseen position trajectories, the model struggles to generate accurate force commands. To address this, we introduce a feedback control mechanism. Our experiments reveal that feedback control does not converge when the force generative model has memory. We therefore adopt a model without memory, enabling stable feedback control. This approach allows the system to generate force commands effectively, even for unseen position trajectories, improving generalization for real-world robot writing tasks.

Abstract: Current approaches for humanoid whole-body manipulation, primarily relying on teleoperation or visual sim-to-real reinforcement learning, are hindered by hardware logistics and complex reward engineering. Consequently, demonstrated autonomous skills remain limited and are typically restricted to controlled environments. In this paper, we present the Humanoid Manipulation Interface (HuMI), a portable and efficient framework for learning diverse whole-body manipulation tasks across various environments. HuMI enables robot-free data collection by capturing rich whole-body motion using portable hardware. This data drives a hierarchical learning pipeline that translates human motions into dexterous and feasible humanoid skills. Extensive experiments across five whole-body tasks--including kneeling, squatting, tossing, walking, and bimanual manipulation--demonstrate that HuMI achieves a 3x increase in data collection efficiency compared to teleoperation and attains a 70% success rate in unseen environments.

Conclusion: RAPID显著提升机器人操作策略开发的迭代效率，开源硬件与软件栈为领域提供标准化工具。

Abstract: Developing robotic manipulation policies is iterative and hypothesis-driven: researchers test tactile sensing, gripper geometries, and sensor placements through real-world data collection and training. Yet even minor end-effector changes often require mechanical refitting and system re-integration, slowing iteration. We present RAPID, a full-stack reconfigurable platform designed to reduce this friction. RAPID is built around a tool-free, modular hardware architecture that unifies handheld data collection and robot deployment, and a matching software stack that maintains real-time awareness of the underlying hardware configuration through a driver-level Physical Mask derived from USB events. This modular hardware architecture reduces reconfiguration to seconds and makes systematic multi-modal ablation studies practical, allowing researchers to sweep diverse gripper and sensing configurations without repeated system bring-up. The Physical Mask exposes modality presence as an explicit runtime signal, enabling auto-configuration and graceful degradation under sensor hot-plug events, so policies can continue executing when sensors are physically added or removed. System-centric experiments show that RAPID reduces the setup time for multi-modal configurations by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional workflows and preserves policy execution under runtime sensor hot-unplug events. The hardware designs, drivers, and software stack are open-sourced at https://rapid-kit.github.io/ .

Abstract: Safe and computationally efficient local planning for mobile robots in dense, unstructured human crowds remains a fundamental challenge. Moreover, ensuring that robot trajectories are similar to how a human moves will increase the acceptance of the robot in human environments. In this paper, we present Crowd-FM, a learning-based approach to address both safety and human-likeness challenges. Our approach has two novel components. First, we train a Conditional Flow-Matching (CFM) policy over a dataset of optimally controlled trajectories to learn a set of collision-free primitives that a robot can choose at any given scenario. The chosen optimal control solver can generate multi-modal collision-free trajectories, allowing the CFM policy to learn a diverse set of maneuvers. Secondly, we learn a score function over a dataset of human demonstration trajectories that provides a human-likeness score for the flow primitives. At inference time, computing the optimal trajectory requires selecting the one with the highest score. Our approach improves the state-of-the-art by showing that our CFM policy alone can produce collision-free navigation with a higher success rate than existing learning-based baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with inference-time refinement, our approach can outperform even expensive optimisation-based planning approaches. Finally, we validate that our scoring network can select trajectories closer to the expert data than a manually designed cost function.

Result: 在不同机器人构型和环境下验证了方法的高效性与准确性，能精确计算复杂表面的覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该方法为工业机器人表面覆盖任务提供了可靠的可行性分析工具。

Abstract: Many automated manufacturing processes rely on industrial robot arms to move process-specific tools along workpiece surfaces. In applications like grinding, sanding, spray painting, or inspection, they need to cover a workpiece fully while keeping their tools perpendicular to its surface. While there are approaches to generate trajectories for these applications, there are no sufficient methods for analyzing the feasibility of full surface coverage. This work proposes a sampling-based approach for continuous coverage estimation that explores reachable surface regions in the configuration space. We define an extended ambient configuration space that allows for the representation of tool position and orientation constraints. A continuation-based approach is used to explore it using two different sampling strategies. A thorough evaluation across different kinematics and environments analyzes their runtime and efficiency. This validates our ability to accurately and efficiently calculate surface coverage for complex surfaces in complicated environments.

Conclusion: SuReNav能有效解决过约束规划问题，实现类人安全导航，具有良好的泛化与实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We address the over-constrained planning problem in semi-static environments. The planning objective is to find a best-effort solution that avoids all hard constraint regions while minimally traversing the least risky areas. Conventional methods often rely on pre-defined area costs, limiting generalizations. Further, the spatial continuity of navigation spaces makes it difficult to identify regions that are passable without overestimation. To overcome these challenges, we propose SuReNav, a superpixel graph-based constraint relaxation and navigation method that imitates human-like safe and efficient navigation. Our framework consists of three components: 1) superpixel graph map generation with regional constraints, 2) regional-constraint relaxation using graph neural network trained on human demonstrations for safe and efficient navigation, and 3) interleaving relaxation, planning, and execution for complete navigation. We evaluate our method against state-of-the-art baselines on 2D semantic maps and 3D maps from OpenStreetMap, achieving the highest human-likeness score of complete navigation while maintaining a balanced trade-off between efficiency and safety. We finally demonstrate its scalability and generalization performance in real-world urban navigation with a quadruped robot, Spot.

Abstract: Flapping-wing micro air vehicles (FWMAVs) have demonstrated remarkable bio-inspired agility, yet tailless two-winged configurations remain largely unexplored due to their complex fluid-structure and wing-body coupling. Here we present \textit{AirPulse}, a 26-gram butterfly-inspired FWMAV that achieves fully onboard, closed-loop, untethered flight without auxiliary control surfaces. The AirPulse robot replicates key biomechanical traits of butterfly flight, including low wing aspect ratio, compliant carbon-fiber-reinforced wings, and low-frequency, high-amplitude flapping that induces cyclic variations in the center of gravity and moment of inertia, producing characteristic body undulation. We establish a quantitative mapping between flapping modulation parameters and force-torque generation, and introduce the Stroke Timing Asymmetry Rhythm (STAR) generator, enabling smooth, stable, and linearly parameterized wingstroke asymmetry for flapping control. Integrating these with an attitude controller, the AirPulse robot maintains pitch and yaw stability despite strong oscillatory dynamics. Free-flight experiments demonstrate stable climbing and turning maneuvers via either angle offset or stroke timing modulation, marking the first onboard controlled flight of the lightest two-winged, tailless butterfly-inspired FWMAV reported in peer-reviewed literature. This work corroborates a foundational platform for lightweight, collision-proof FWMAVs, bridging biological inspiration with practical aerial robotics. Their non-invasive maneuverability is ideally suited for real-world applications, such as confined-space inspection and ecological monitoring, inaccessible to traditional drones, while their biomechanical fidelity provides a physical model to decode the principles underlying the erratic yet efficient flight of real butterflies.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DynaRetarget, a complete pipeline for retargeting human motions to humanoid control policies. The core component of DynaRetarget is a novel Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization (SBTO) framework that refines imperfect kinematic trajectories into dynamically feasible motions. SBTO incrementally advances the optimization horizon, enabling optimization over the entire trajectory for long-horizon tasks. We validate DynaRetarget by successfully retargeting hundreds of humanoid-object demonstrations and achieving higher success rates than the state of the art. The framework also generalizes across varying object properties, such as mass, size, and geometry, using the same tracking objective. This ability to robustly retarget diverse demonstrations opens the door to generating large-scale synthetic datasets of humanoid loco-manipulation trajectories, addressing a major bottleneck in real-world data collection.

Result: 在真实机器人平台上验证，方法在精度和实际应用中优于传统视觉伺服技术。

Conclusion: 紧密耦合感知与控制的闭环架构显著提升无纹理物体视觉伺服的鲁棒性与安全性。

Abstract: Visual servoing is fundamental to robotic applications, enabling precise positioning and control. However, applying it to textureless objects remains a challenge due to the absence of reliable visual features. Moreover, adverse visual conditions, such as occlusions, often corrupt visual feedback, leading to reduced accuracy and instability in visual servoing. In this work, we build upon learning-based keypoint detection for textureless objects and propose a method that enhances robustness by tightly integrating perception and control in a closed loop. Specifically, we employ an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that integrates per-frame keypoint measurements to estimate 6D object pose, which drives pose-based visual servoing (PBVS) for control. The resulting camera motion, in turn, enhances the tracking of subsequent keypoints, effectively closing the perception-control loop. Additionally, unlike standard PBVS, we propose a probabilistic control law that computes both camera velocity and its associated uncertainty, enabling uncertainty-aware control for safe and reliable operation. We validate our approach on real-world robotic platforms using quantitative metrics and grasping experiments, demonstrating that our method outperforms traditional visual servoing techniques in both accuracy and practical application.

Conclusion: SURE通过统一框架有效兼顾鲁棒性与计算效率，是处理接触不确定性任务的有力方案。

Abstract: Robotic tasks involving contact interactions pose significant challenges for trajectory optimization due to discontinuous dynamics. Conventional formulations typically assume deterministic contact events, which limit robustness and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose SURE, a robust trajectory optimization framework that explicitly accounts for contact timing uncertainty. By allowing multiple trajectories to branch from possible pre-impact states and later rejoin a shared trajectory, SURE achieves both robustness and computational efficiency within a unified optimization framework. We evaluate SURE on two representative tasks with unknown impact times. In a cart-pole balancing task involving uncertain wall location, SURE achieves an average improvement of 21.6% in success rate when branch switching is enabled during control. In an egg-catching experiment using a robotic manipulator, SURE improves the success rate by 40%. These results demonstrate that SURE substantially enhances robustness compared to conventional nominal formulations.

Abstract: Zero-order optimization has recently received significant attention for designing optimal trajectories and policies for robotic systems. However, most existing methods (e.g., MPPI, CEM, and CMA-ES) are local in nature, as they rely on gradient estimation. In this paper, we introduce consensus-based optimization (CBO) to robotics, which is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum under mild assumptions. We provide theoretical analysis and illustrative examples that give intuition into the fundamental differences between CBO and existing methods. To demonstrate the scalability of CBO for robotics problems, we consider three challenging trajectory optimization scenarios: (1) a long-horizon problem for a simple system, (2) a dynamic balance problem for a highly underactuated system, and (3) a high-dimensional problem with only a terminal cost. Our results show that CBO is able to achieve lower costs with respect to existing methods on all three challenging settings. This opens a new framework to study global trajectory optimization in robotics.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing pushes the boundaries of high-speed motion planning and multi-agent strategic decision-making. Success in this domain requires drones not only to navigate at their limits but also to anticipate and counteract competitors' actions. In this paper, we study a fundamental question that arises in this domain: how deeply should an agent strategize before taking an action? To this end, we compare two planning paradigms: the Model Predictive Game (MPG), which finds interaction-aware strategies at the expense of longer computation times, and contouring Model Predictive Control (MPC), which computes strategies rapidly but does not reason about interactions. We perform extensive experiments to study this trade-off, revealing that MPG outperforms MPC at moderate velocities but loses its advantage at higher speeds due to latency. To address this shortcoming, we propose a Learned Model Predictive Game (LMPG) approach that amortizes model predictive gameplay to reduce latency. In both simulation and hardware experiments, we benchmark our approach against MPG and MPC in head-to-head races, finding that LMPG outperforms both baselines.

Abstract: Being able to simulate the outcomes of actions in varied environments will revolutionize the development of generalist agents at scale. However, modeling these world dynamics, especially for dexterous robotics tasks, poses significant challenges due to limited data coverage and scarce action labels. As an endeavor towards this end, we introduce DreamDojo, a foundation world model that learns diverse interactions and dexterous controls from 44k hours of egocentric human videos. Our data mixture represents the largest video dataset to date for world model pretraining, spanning a wide range of daily scenarios with diverse objects and skills. To address the scarcity of action labels, we introduce continuous latent actions as unified proxy actions, enhancing interaction knowledge transfer from unlabeled videos. After post-training on small-scale target robot data, DreamDojo demonstrates a strong understanding of physics and precise action controllability. We also devise a distillation pipeline that accelerates DreamDojo to a real-time speed of 10.81 FPS and further improves context consistency. Our work enables several important applications based on generative world models, including live teleoperation, policy evaluation, and model-based planning. Systematic evaluation on multiple challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks verifies the significance of our method for simulating open-world, contact-rich tasks, paving the way for general-purpose robot world models.

Abstract: The lightweight semi-supervised learning (LSL) strategy provides an effective approach of conserving labeled samples and minimizing model inference costs. Prior research has effectively applied knowledge transfer learning and co-training regularization from large to small models in LSL. However, such training strategies are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, thereby increasing the difficulty of finding the optimal solution. This has prompted us to investigate the feasibility of integrating three low-cost scenarios for text mining tasks: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models. We propose NanoNet, a novel framework for lightweight text mining that implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision. It employs online knowledge distillation to generate multiple small models and enhances their performance through mutual learning regularization. The entire process leverages parameter-efficient learning, reducing training costs and minimizing supervision requirements, ultimately yielding a lightweight model for downstream inference.

Abstract: Wind power ramp events are difficult to forecast due to strong variability, multi-scale dynamics, and site-specific meteorological effects. This paper proposes an event-first, frequency-aware forecasting paradigm that directly predicts ramp events and reconstructs the power trajectory thereafter, rather than inferring events from dense forecasts. The framework is built on an enhanced Ramping Behaviour Analysis (RBA$_θ$) method's event representation and progressively integrates statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Traditional forecasting models with post-hoc event extraction provides a strong interpretable baseline but exhibits limited generalisation across sites. Direct event prediction using Random Forests improves robustness over survival-based formulations, motivating fully event-aware modelling. To capture the multi-scale nature of wind ramps, we introduce an event-first deep architecture that integrates wavelet-based frequency decomposition, temporal excitation features, and adaptive feature selection. The resulting sequence models enable stable long-horizon event prediction, physically consistent trajectory reconstruction, and zero-shot transfer to previously unseen wind farms. Empirical analysis shows that ramp magnitude and duration are governed by distinct mid-frequency bands, allowing accurate signal reconstruction from sparse event forecasts. An agentic forecasting layer is proposed, in which specialised workflows are selected dynamically based on operational context. Together, the framework demonstrates that event-first, frequency-aware forecasting provides a transferable and operationally aligned alternative to trajectory-first wind-power prediction.

Conclusion: EVE显著提升文档 grounded 推理质量，但受限于自然语言固有歧义，性能存在饱和边界，反映语言推理的根本局限。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are powerful generators driven by statistical next-token prediction. While effective at producing fluent text, this design biases models toward high-probability continuations rather than exhaustive and faithful answers grounded in source content. As a result, directly applying LLMs lacks systematic mechanisms to ensure both completeness (avoiding omissions) and faithfulness (avoiding unsupported content), which fundamentally conflicts with core AI safety principles. To address this limitation, we present EVE, a structured framework for document-grounded reasoning.
  Unlike free-form prompting, EVE constrains generation to a structured, verifiable pipeline that decomposes high-rigor reasoning into extraction, validation, and enumeration. Empirically, this design enables consistent and simultaneous improvements in recall, precision, and F1-score: recall and precision increase by up to 24\% and 29\%, respectively, with a corresponding 31\% gain in F1-score. This effectively breaks the long-standing trade-off between coverage and accuracy typical of single-pass LLM generation, while also mitigating generation truncation caused by length limitations. At the same time, we emphasize that EVE exhibits performance saturation due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, reflecting fundamental limits of language-based reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种名为“实用好奇心”的混合学习-优化范式，结合贝叶斯优化与实验设计，通过最小化预期自由能提升性能与信息获取的协同效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有贝叶斯优化（BO）和贝叶斯实验设计（BED）方法割裂了目标驱动与信息驱动，难以应对学习与优化紧密耦合的现实任务。

Method: 基于主动推断框架，引入“预期自由能”作为统一目标函数，同时优化实用效用与认知信息增益。

Result: 在约束系统辨识、目标主动搜索和未知偏好复合优化等任务中，该方法显著优于传统BO和BED基线，提升估计精度、关键区域覆盖与最终解质量。

Conclusion: 实用好奇心为混合学习-优化问题提供了一种统一、高效且灵活的解决方案，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Many engineering and scientific workflows depend on expensive black-box evaluations, requiring decision-making that simultaneously improves performance and reduces uncertainty. Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian experimental design (BED) offer powerful yet largely separate treatments of goal-seeking and information-seeking, providing limited guidance for hybrid settings where learning and optimization are intrinsically coupled. We propose "pragmatic curiosity," a hybrid learning-optimization paradigm derived from active inference, in which actions are selected by minimizing the expected free energy--a single objective that couples pragmatic utility with epistemic information gain. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness and flexibility of pragmatic curiosity on various real-world hybrid tasks, including constrained system identification, targeted active search, and composite optimization with unknown preferences. Across these benchmarks, pragmatic curiosity consistently outperforms strong BO-type and BED-type baselines, delivering higher estimation accuracy, better critical-region coverage, and improved final solution quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于张量训练的量子启发防御方法，在保留模型准确性和可解释性的同时，有效增强临床预测模型的隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床机器学习模型需在预测精度、可解释性和隐私之间取得平衡，但传统模型如逻辑回归和神经网络易受隐私攻击。

Method: 设计针对训练数据泄露的攻击方法，评估逻辑回归和浅层神经网络的隐私风险；提出基于张量训练（TT）的量子启发防御，通过参数张量化实现隐私保护。

Result: 逻辑回归在白盒攻击下尤为脆弱，交叉验证加剧风险；张量训练方法可将白盒攻击降至随机猜测水平，黑盒攻击效果媲美差分隐私，同时保留并增强可解释性。

Conclusion: 张量化方法为临床预测提供了一种实用、可扩展的解决方案，实现隐私、准确与可解释性的统一。

Abstract: Machine learning in clinical settings must balance predictive accuracy, interpretability, and privacy. Models such as logistic regression (LR) offer transparency, while neural networks (NNs) provide greater predictive power; yet both remain vulnerable to privacy attacks. We empirically assess these risks by designing attacks that identify which public datasets were used to train a model under varying levels of adversarial access, applying them to LORIS, a publicly available LR model for immunotherapy response prediction, as well as to additional shallow NN models trained for the same task. Our results show that both models leak significant training-set information, with LRs proving particularly vulnerable in white-box scenarios. Moreover, we observe that common practices such as cross-validation in LRs exacerbate these risks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a quantum-inspired defense based on tensorizing discretized models into tensor trains (TTs), which fully obfuscates parameters while preserving accuracy, reducing white-box attacks to random guessing and degrading black-box attacks comparably to Differential Privacy. TT models retain LR interpretability and extend it through efficient computation of marginal and conditional distributions, while also enabling this higher level of interpretability for NNs. Our results demonstrate that tensorization is widely applicable and establishes a practical foundation for private, interpretable, and effective clinical prediction.

TL;DR: MoP是一种统一深度与宽度剪枝的迭代框架，在LLaMA和LLaVA模型上显著提升压缩效率与推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型计算开销大，现有剪枝方法仅单一维度（深度或宽度），限制了压缩效果与推理加速。

Method: MoP通过迭代生成深度剪枝与宽度剪枝两个分支，动态选择最优路径进行结构化剪枝，并结合文本微调恢复性能。

Result: 在LLaMA-2/3上超越现有方法，在40%压缩下端到端延迟降低39%；扩展至LLaVA-1.5后，视觉任务性能可通过文本微调恢复。

Conclusion: MoP实现了深度与宽度剪枝的协同优化，是高效结构化剪枝的新范式，兼具高压缩率与实际推理加速能力。

Abstract: The high computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate methods that reduce parameter count and accelerate inference. In response, model pruning emerges as an effective strategy, yet current methods typically focus on a single dimension-depth or width. We introduce MoP (Mixture of Pruners), an iterative framework that unifies these dimensions. At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression. Finally, extending MoP to the vision-language model LLaVA-1.5, we notably improve computational efficiency and demonstrate that text-only recovery fine-tuning can restore performance even on visual tasks.

Motivation: 气候灾害日益破坏城市交通与应急响应系统，亟需精准预测建筑级风险并整合交通可达性信息以支持智能车辆决策。

Method: Skjold-DiT 包含三部分：Fjell-Prompt（跨城市提示条件）、Norrland-Fusion（多模态特征融合）、Valkyrie-Forecast（反事实风险模拟），并构建了 BCUR 数据集进行验证。

Conclusion: Skjold-DiT 为城市气候韧性提供了可部署的智能交通响应工具，显著提升应急系统的适应性与效率。

Abstract: Climate hazards increasingly disrupt urban transportation and emergency-response operations by damaging housing stock, degrading infrastructure, and reducing network accessibility. This paper presents Skjold-DiT, a diffusion-transformer framework that integrates heterogeneous spatio-temporal urban data to forecast building-level climate-risk indicators while explicitly incorporating transportation-network structure and accessibility signals relevant to intelligent vehicles (e.g., emergency reachability and evacuation-route constraints). Concretely, Skjold-DiT enables hazard-conditioned routing constraints by producing calibrated, uncertainty-aware accessibility layers (reachability, travel-time inflation, and route redundancy) that can be consumed by intelligent-vehicle routing and emergency dispatch systems. Skjold-DiT combines: (1) Fjell-Prompt, a prompt-based conditioning interface designed to support cross-city transfer; (2) Norrland-Fusion, a cross-modal attention mechanism unifying hazard maps/imagery, building attributes, demographics, and transportation infrastructure into a shared latent representation; and (3) Valkyrie-Forecast, a counterfactual simulator for generating probabilistic risk trajectories under intervention prompts. We introduce the Baltic-Caspian Urban Resilience (BCUR) dataset with 847,392 building-level observations across six cities, including multi-hazard annotations (e.g., flood and heat indicators) and transportation accessibility features. Experiments evaluate prediction quality, cross-city generalization, calibration, and downstream transportation-relevant outcomes, including reachability and hazard-conditioned travel times under counterfactual interventions.

TL;DR: SWIRL是一种无需动作标签、仅用状态序列自提升的世界建模框架，通过交替优化正向与逆向动力学模型，在多个基准上显著提升LLM/VLM的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统世界建模依赖昂贵的动作标注轨迹，难以扩展；SWIRL旨在仅用状态序列学习可解释且一致的世界模型。

Method: SWIRL将动作视为潜变量，交替进行变分信息最大化（提升正向模型FWM）和ELBO最大化（优化逆向模型IDM），并用GRPO强化学习与对偶模型对数概率作为奖励信号进行训练。

Result: 在AURORABench、ByteMorph、WorldPredictionBench和StableToolBench上分别提升16%、28%、16%和14%。

Conclusion: SWIRL实现了无动作标签下的高效世界建模，理论可学习性有保障，适用于多模态与文本环境中的长期推理与规划。

Abstract: Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.

TL;DR: 提出Tempora框架，首次在时间压力下系统评估测试时自适应（TTA）方法，揭示传统评估方法排名不稳定，真实部署中无单一最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TTA评估忽略延迟约束，而实际应用中预测过晚即失效，亟需考虑准确性-延迟权衡的评估框架。

Method: 构建Tempora框架，包含时间场景、评估协议和三种时变效用指标：离散效用（硬截止）、连续效用（价值衰减）和摊销效用（预算约束），并在ImageNet-C上对7种TTA方法进行240次评估。

Result: 传统排名与时间压力下排名显著不一致，SOTA方法ETA在41.2%场景中表现不佳，最优方法随扰动类型和时间约束动态变化。

Conclusion: Tempora揭示了TTA方法排名的不稳定性，为实践者提供选型依据，为研究者指明可部署适配的优化方向。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a compelling remedy for machine learning (ML) models that degrade under domain shifts, improving generalisation on-the-fly with only unlabelled samples. This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner. By enabling systematic evaluation across diverse temporal constraints for the first time, Tempora reveals when and why rankings invert, offering practitioners a lens for method selection and researchers a target for deployable adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型和流匹配的生成策略主要适用于连续动作空间，难以处理离散动作和多目标场景。

Method: 用连续时间马尔可夫链替代连续流，采用Q加权流匹配目标，并通过因子化条件路径缓解多智能体联合动作空间爆炸问题。

Result: 理论证明在理想条件下可收敛至最优策略，实验在高维控制、多模态决策和动态多目标场景中表现稳健，且可应用于连续控制通过动作量化。

Conclusion: 提出首个通用离散动作流匹配框架，显著扩展了生成式离线RL的应用边界。

Abstract: Generative policies based on diffusion models and flow matching have shown strong promise for offline reinforcement learning (RL), but their applicability remains largely confined to continuous action spaces. To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives. Our discrete framework can also be applied to continuous-control problems through action quantization, providing a flexible trade-off between representational complexity and performance.

*Prashant Mehta,Sean Meyn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Q-learning与线性函数逼近在特定策略下稳定，但解的唯一性和收敛性仍存疑；本文揭示了更严格的结构需求，即使基函数理想，贪婪策略下也可能存在多个解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究虽证明了在$(\varepsilon,\kappa)$-tamed Gibbs策略下Q-learning的稳定性与PBE解的存在性，但未解决解的唯一性及非标准设置下的收敛条件。

Method: 通过一维反例分析盲策略下PBE解的缺失或多重性，并构造理想基函数下贪婪策略导致PBE多解的案例，揭示收敛所需更强结构。

Result: 即使真Q函数在基函数张成空间内，贪婪策略和近似Gibbs策略下仍可能存在多个PBE解，表明传统稳定性条件不足。

Conclusion: Q-learning在函数逼近下的收敛需远强于以往假设的结构条件，仅靠基函数理想或策略温和不足以保证唯一解与稳定收敛。

Abstract: In recent work it is shown that Q-learning with linear function approximation is stable, in the sense of bounded parameter estimates, under the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy; $κ$ is inverse temperature, and $\varepsilon>0$ is introduced for additional exploration. Under these assumptions it also follows that there is a solution to the projected Bellman equation (PBE). Left open is uniqueness of the solution, and criteria for convergence outside of the standard tabular or linear MDP settings.
  The present work extends these results to other variants of Q-learning, and clarifies prior work: a one dimensional example shows that under an oblivious policy for training there may be no solution to the PBE, or multiple solutions, and in each case the algorithm is not stable under oblivious training.
  The main contribution is that far more structure is required for convergence. An example is presented for which the basis is ideal, in the sense that the true Q-function is in the span of the basis. However, there are two solutions to the PBE under the greedy policy, and hence also for the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon>0$ and $κ\ge 1$.

Motivation: 传统MoE模型在专家激活后全量执行，导致精度与计算开销间存在较大离散性，难以精细调控。

Method: 引入可嵌套的slimmable专家结构，支持按需调整专家宽度，结合多宽度训练与标准MoE目标，并提出基于路由器置信度的动态宽度决策机制。

Result: 在GPT+OpenWebText上实验表明，MoSE在全宽度下媲美或优于标准MoE，并在相同计算预算下显著提升精度，持续优化精度-成本帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: MoSE通过细粒度条件计算实现更灵活的推理效率控制，为大模型部署提供更优的精度-计算折中方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale large language models efficiently by sparsely activating experts, but once an expert is selected, it is executed fully. Hence, the trade-off between accuracy and computation in an MoE model typically exhibits large discontinuities. We propose Mixture of Slimmable Experts (MoSE), an MoE architecture in which each expert has a nested, slimmable structure that can be executed at variable widths. This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives. During inference, we explore strategies for runtime width determination, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism that learns how to map router confidence/probabilities to expert widths under a fixed budget. Experiments on GPT models trained on OpenWebText demonstrate that MoSE matches or improves upon standard MoE at full width and consistently shifts the Pareto frontier for accuracy vs. cost, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer FLOPs.

Motivation: 尽管扩散模型使用高维噪声种子生成样本，但其潜在空间是否包含可预测样本属性（如类别）的结构尚不明确。

Method: 通过预训练分类器的置信度分数筛选噪声种子，分析不同置信度子集下的类可分性。

Result: 仅在高置信度样本的噪声种子中观察到明显的类别可分性，表明类相关结构仅在置信度过滤后显现。

Conclusion: 置信度过滤可作为条件生成的替代方法，无需传统引导机制。

Abstract: Diffusion models rely on a high-dimensional latent space of initial noise seeds, yet it remains unclear whether this space contains sufficient structure to predict properties of the generated samples, such as their classes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of latent structure through the lens of confidence scores assigned by a pre-trained classifier to generated samples. We show that while the latent space appears largely unstructured when considering all noise realizations, restricting attention to initial noise seeds that produce high-confidence samples reveals pronounced class separability. By comparing class predictability across noise subsets of varying confidence and examining the class separability of the latent space, we find evidence of class-relevant latent structure that becomes observable only under confidence-based filtering. As a practical implication, we discuss how confidence-based filtering enables conditional generation as an alternative to guidance-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经压缩算法在转换到DNA时采用简单的二进制到四进制编码，浪费了熵模型的优化潜力，导致压缩效率低且编码栈复杂。

Method: SCONE提出一个即插即用模块，在潜空间中直接执行基于DNA碱基的四进制算术编码，并通过约束感知自适应编码模块动态调整概率分布，强制满足GC平衡和同聚物抑制等生化约束。

Result: SCONE在近乎零计算开销（<2%延迟）下实现近乎完美的约束满足，且保持完全可逆性，不修改原有超先验模型。

Conclusion: SCONE为端到端DNA兼容的神经编解码器提供了一种潜空间无关的统一接口，显著提升DNA存储的效率与实用性。

Abstract: DNA storage has matured from concept to practical stage, yet its integration with neural compression pipelines remains inefficient. Early DNA encoders applied redundancy-heavy constraint layers atop raw binary data - workable but primitive. Recent neural codecs compress data into learned latent representations with rich statistical structure, yet still convert these latents to DNA via naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, discarding the entropy model's optimization. This mismatch undermines compression efficiency and complicates the encoding stack. A plug-in module that collapses latent compression and DNA encoding into a single step. SCONE performs quaternary arithmetic coding directly on the latent space in DNA bases. Its Constraint-Aware Adaptive Coding module dynamically steers the entropy encoder's learned probability distribution to enforce biochemical constraints - Guanine-Cytosine (GC) balance and homopolymer suppression - deterministically during encoding, eliminating post-hoc correction. The design preserves full reversibility and exploits the hyperprior model's learned priors without modification. Experiments show SCONE achieves near-perfect constraint satisfaction with negligible computational overhead (<2% latency), establishing a latent-agnostic interface for end-to-end DNA-compatible learned codecs.

Conclusion: 该方法高效、通用，适用于主流GPU和MoE架构，为大模型预训练提供实用加速方案。

Abstract: Trainings of Large Language Models are generally bottlenecked by matrix multiplications. In the Transformer architecture, a large portion of these operations happens in the Feed Forward Network (FFN), and this portion increases for larger models, up to 50% of the total pretraining floating point operations. We show that we can leverage hardware-accelerated sparsity to accelerate all matrix multiplications in the FFN, with 2:4 sparsity for weights and v:n:m (Venom) sparsity for activations. Our recipe relies on sparse training steps to accelerate a large part of the pretraining, associated with regular dense training steps towards the end. Overall, models trained with this approach exhibit the same performance on our quality benchmarks, and can speed up training end-to-end by 1.4 to 1.7x. This approach is applicable to all NVIDIA GPUs starting with the A100 generation, and is orthogonal to common optimization techniques, such as, quantization, and can also be applied to mixture-of-experts model architectures.

Conclusion: 所提框架为联邦学习提供高效、通用、无侵入的数据遗忘解决方案，优于现有需架构修改的方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources, preserving privacy by keeping data local. However, increasing legal and ethical demands, such as the "right to be forgotten", and the need to mitigate data poisoning attacks have underscored the urgent necessity for principled data unlearning in FL. Unlike centralized settings, the distributed nature of FL complicates the removal of individual data contributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated unlearning framework formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize an $f$-divergence between the model trained with all data and the model retrained without specific data points, while minimizing the degradation on retained data. Our framework could act like a plugin and be added to almost any federated setup, unlike SOTA methods like (\cite{10269017} which requires model degradation in server, or \cite{khalil2025notfederatedunlearningweight} which requires to involve model architecture and model weights). This formulation allows for efficient approximation of data removal effects in a federated setting. We provide empirical evaluations to show that our method achieves significant speedups over naive retraining, with minimal impact on utility.

Conclusion: μA理论有效指导学习率设置，显著降低调参成本，跨任务实验验证其泛化性

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a standard tool for parameter-efficient finetuning of large models. While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($μ$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the "optimal" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $μ$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($μ$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning.

TL;DR: 本文提出GCPA方法，通过几何修正的Procrustes对齐实现多模型潜在空间的高效对齐，提升任意两模型间的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅支持两两对齐，无法扩展到多模型场景，且缺乏一致的全局参考空间。

Method: 采用广义Procrustes分析（GPA）构建共享正交空间，并引入几何修正项（GCPA）以优化方向不匹配问题。

Result: GCPA在保持共享参考空间的同时，显著提升了任意两模型间的检索性能。

Conclusion: GCPA在多模型对齐任务中兼具几何保真性与检索有效性，是优于传统CCA和纯GPA的解决方案。

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that independently trained neural networks converge to increasingly similar latent spaces. However, current strategies for mapping these representations are inherently pairwise, scaling quadratically with the number of models and failing to yield a consistent global reference. In this paper, we study the alignment of $M \ge 3$ models. We first adapt Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) to construct a shared orthogonal universe that preserves the internal geometry essential for tasks like model stitching. We then show that strict isometric alignment is suboptimal for retrieval, where agreement-maximizing methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) typically prevail. To bridge this gap, we finally propose Geometry-Corrected Procrustes Alignment (GCPA), which establishes a robust GPA-based universe followed by a post-hoc correction for directional mismatch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCPA consistently improves any-to-any retrieval while retaining a practical shared reference space.

Result: 证明了权重动态集中于低维不变子空间，且低秩初始化可实现与全参数模型相当的分类性能。

Conclusion: 非线性网络的低维训练动态具有理论可解释性，低秩参数化是高效训练的有效途径。

Abstract: Recent empirical evidence has demonstrated that the training dynamics of large-scale deep neural networks occur within low-dimensional subspaces. While this has inspired new research into low-rank training, compression, and adaptation, theoretical justification for these dynamics in nonlinear networks remains limited. %compared to deep linear settings. To address this gap, this paper analyzes the learning dynamics of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) under gradient descent (GD). We demonstrate that the weight dynamics concentrate within invariant low-dimensional subspaces throughout training. Theoretically, we precisely characterize these invariant subspaces for two-layer networks with smooth nonlinear activations, providing insight into their emergence. Experimentally, we validate that this phenomenon extends beyond our theoretical assumptions. Leveraging these insights, we empirically show there exists a low-rank MLP parameterization that, when initialized within the appropriate subspaces, matches the classification performance of fully-parameterized counterparts on a variety of classification tasks.

TL;DR: SR4-Fit是一种新型可解释分类算法，在保持高预测性能的同时解决了黑箱模型和传统规则算法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型需可解释性，但高性能模型多为黑箱，传统规则算法如RuleFit预测能力弱且不稳定。

Method: 提出Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit)，结合正则化回归与规则拟合，生成稳定且可解释的规则集。

Result: 在国会选区选举预测中，SR4-Fit准确率超越黑箱模型与RuleFit，并揭示了此前无法解释的人口因素组合；在六个公开数据集上表现一致优异。

Conclusion: SR4-Fit成功突破可解释性与预测性能的传统权衡，为选举预测及其他分类任务提供兼具准确性与透明性的新方案。

Abstract: The growth of machine learning demands interpretable models for critical applications, yet most high-performing models are ``black-box'' systems that obscure input-output relationships, while traditional rule-based algorithms like RuleFit suffer from a lack of predictive power and instability despite their simplicity. This motivated our development of Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit), a novel interpretable classification algorithm that addresses these limitations while maintaining superior classification performance. Using demographic characteristics of U.S. congressional districts from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we demonstrate that SR4-Fit can predict House election party outcomes with unprecedented accuracy and interpretability. Our results show that while the majority party remains the strongest predictor, SR4-Fit has revealed intrinsic combinations of demographic factors that affect prediction outcomes that were unable to be interpreted in black-box algorithms such as random forests. The SR4-Fit algorithm surpasses both black-box models and existing interpretable rule-based algorithms such as RuleFit with respect to accuracy, simplicity, and robustness, generating stable and interpretable rule sets while maintaining superior predictive performance, thus addressing the traditional trade-off between model interpretability and predictive capability in electoral forecasting. To further validate SR4-Fit's performance, we also apply it to six additional publicly available classification datasets, like the breast cancer, Ecoli, page blocks, Pima Indians, vehicle, and yeast datasets, and find similar results.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的自动化平衡框架为游戏设计提供了高效、可解释的新范式，具备广泛适用潜力。

Abstract: Game balancing is a longstanding challenge requiring repeated playtesting, expert intuition, and extensive manual tuning. We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.

Method: PEPO使用基于不相交数据子集训练的偏好优化策略集成，通过最坏情况聚合机制实现悲观性，避免学习显式奖励模型。

Result: 在表格设置下，PEPO的样本复杂度仅依赖单策略集中性系数，理论性能优于DPO，并在实践中表现优异。

Conclusion: PEPO在保持DPO简单性的同时，有效缓解过优化问题，具有理论保障和实用价值。

Abstract: We introduce PEPO (Pessimistic Ensemble based Preference Optimization), a single-step Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-like algorithm to mitigate the well-known over-optimization issue in preference learning without requiring the knowledge of the data-generating distribution or learning an explicit reward model. PEPO achieves pessimism via an ensemble of preference-optimized policies trained on disjoint data subsets and then aggregates them through a worst case construction that favors the agreement across models. In the tabular setting, PEPO achieves sample complexity guarantees depending only on a single-policy concentrability coefficient, thus avoiding the all-policy concentrability which affects the guarantees of algorithms prone to over-optimization, such as DPO. The theoretical findings are corroborated by a convincing practical performance, while retaining the simplicity and the practicality of DPO-style training.

Method: 提出AXEX-CF框架，联合优化边添加与删除，结合对抗攻击的洞察，在约束扰动预算下同时优化保真度、稀疏性与可信度

Result: 在合成与真实节点分类数据集上，AXEX-CF生成的解释更具信度、简洁性和合理性

Conclusion: 将对抗攻击思想融入反事实解释能显著提升GNN解释的质量与实用性

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations offer an intuitive way to interpret graph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying minimal changes that alter a model's prediction, thereby answering "what must differ for a different outcome?". In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate that ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning for GNNs.

Conclusion: LP-FNO是高效代理模型，可在毫秒级预测宽参数范围下的完整三维场与相界面，显著优于传统仿真方法。

Abstract: High-fidelity simulations of laser welding capture complex thermo-fluid phenomena, including phase change, free-surface deformation, and keyhole dynamics, however their computational cost limits large-scale process exploration and real-time use. In this work we present the Laser Processing Fourier Neural Operator (LP-FNO), a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) based surrogate model that learns the parametric solution operator of various laser processes from multiphysics simulations generated with FLOW-3D WELD (registered trademark). Through a novel approach of reformulating the transient problem in the moving laser frame and applying temporal averaging, the system results in a quasi-steady state setting suitable for operator learning, even in the keyhole welding regime. The proposed LP-FNO maps process parameters to three-dimensional temperature fields and melt-pool boundaries across a broad process window spanning conduction and keyhole regimes using the non-dimensional normalized enthalpy formulation. The model achieves temperature prediction errors on the order of 1% and intersection-over-union scores for melt-pool segmentation over 0.9. We demonstrate that a LP-FNO model trained on coarse-resolution data can be evaluated on finer grids, yielding accurate super-resolved predictions in mesh-converged conduction regimes, whereas discrepancies in keyhole regimes reflect unresolved dynamics in the coarse-mesh training data. These results indicate that the LP-FNO provides an efficient surrogate modeling framework for laser welding, enabling prediction of full three-dimensional fields and phase interfaces over wide parameter ranges in just tens of milliseconds, up to a hundred thousand times faster than traditional Finite Volume multi-physics software.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏布尔多项式在AND基下的Möbius变换因基向量相干性难以用传统压缩感知方法解决，亟需新方法。

Method: 利用自适应群测试，提出FASMT和PASMT两种算法，分别实现近最优查询复杂度和减少自适应轮数。

Result: FASMT使用O(sd log(n/d))查询，PASMT减少自适应轮数至O(d² log(n/d))且与s无关，在超图重建中超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为稀疏Möbius变换提供了高效可实现方案，并成功应用于真实超图学习，验证了实用性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of exactly learning an $s$-sparse real-valued Boolean polynomial of degree $d$ of the form $f:\{ 0,1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. This problem corresponds to decomposing functions in the AND basis and is known as taking a Möbius transform. While the analogous problem for the parity basis (Fourier transform) $f: \{-1,1 \}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is well-understood, the AND basis presents a unique challenge: the basis vectors are coherent, precluding standard compressed sensing methods. We overcome this challenge by identifying that we can exploit adaptive group testing to provide a constructive, query-efficient implementation of the Möbius transform (also known as Möbius inversion) for sparse functions. We present two algorithms based on this insight. The Fully-Adaptive Sparse Möbius Transform (FASMT) uses $O(sd \log(n/d))$ adaptive queries in $O((sd + n) sd \log(n/d))$ time, which we show is near-optimal in query complexity. Furthermore, we also present the Partially-Adaptive Sparse Möbius Transform (PASMT), which uses $O(sd^2\log(n/d))$ queries, trading a factor of $d$ to reduce the number of adaptive rounds to $O(d^2\log(n/d))$, with no dependence on $s$. When applied to hypergraph reconstruction from edge-count queries, our results improve upon baselines by avoiding the combinatorial explosion in the rank $d$. We demonstrate the practical utility of our method for hypergraph reconstruction by applying it to learning real hypergraphs in simulations.

Motivation: 现有评估指标无法检测深层残留知识，导致遗忘效果被高估。

Method: 提出REBEL，一种进化式对抗提示生成方法，用于探测被遗忘数据的可恢复性。

Result: 在TOFU和WMDP基准上，REBEL的攻击成功率分别达60%和93%，显著优于静态基线。

Conclusion: 当前模型遗忘方法缺乏真正数据清除能力，需重新设计更有效的遗忘机制。

Abstract: Machine unlearning for LLMs aims to remove sensitive or copyrighted data from trained models. However, the true efficacy of current unlearning methods remains uncertain. Standard evaluation metrics rely on benign queries that often mistake superficial information suppression for genuine knowledge removal. Such metrics fail to detect residual knowledge that more sophisticated prompting strategies could still extract. We introduce REBEL, an evolutionary approach for adversarial prompt generation designed to probe whether unlearned data can still be recovered. Our experiments demonstrate that REBEL successfully elicits ``forgotten'' knowledge from models that seemed to be forgotten in standard unlearning benchmarks, revealing that current unlearning methods may provide only a superficial layer of protection. We validate our framework on subsets of the TOFU and WMDP benchmarks, evaluating performance across a diverse suite of unlearning algorithms. Our experiments show that REBEL consistently outperforms static baselines, recovering ``forgotten'' knowledge with Attack Success Rates (ASRs) reaching up to 60% on TOFU and 93% on WMDP. We will make all code publicly available upon acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/patryk-rybak/REBEL/

Motivation: 现有研究关注引导效果，但忽视干预是否仅改变目标属性，而引发其他 unintended 行为变化，亟需系统评估特异性。

Method: 提出三维度特异性框架：一般特异性（保留流畅性与无关能力）、控制特异性（保留相关控制属性）、鲁棒性特异性（分布偏移下保持控制属性），并用于评估减少过度拒绝与忠实性幻觉的案例。

Result: 引导方法在 efficacy 和一般/控制特异性上表现良好，但鲁棒性特异性显著缺失，例如减少过度拒绝的同时大幅增加被越狱攻击的风险。

Conclusion: 仅评估效果和基础特异性不足，必须加入鲁棒性评估，否则可能误判引导方法的安全性，带来真实风险。

Abstract: Model steering, which involves intervening on hidden representations at inference time, has emerged as a lightweight alternative to finetuning for precisely controlling large language models. While steering efficacy has been widely studied, evaluations of whether interventions alter only the intended property remain limited, especially with respect to unintended changes in behaviors related to the target property. We call this notion specificity. We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity. In the case of overrefusal steering, for example, all steering methods reduce overrefusal without harming general abilities and refusal on harmful queries; however, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks. Our work provides the first systematic evaluation of specificity in model steering, showing that standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient, because without robustness evaluation, steering methods may appear reliable even when they compromise model safety.

Motivation: 随机化算法在策略分类中潜力未被充分探索，现有下界仅适用于确定性学习器，且不可知设置下的 regret 上界远低于标准在线学习速率。

Method: 在现实设置中，将确定性学习器的下界推广至所有学习器，并提出首个优于确定性上界的随机化学习器；在不可知设置中，使用凸优化设计适当学习器，改进 regret 上界并证明其最优性。

Conclusion: 随机化算法显著提升策略分类性能；适当学习在不可知设置中已达理论最优，进一步改进需依赖非适当学习。

Abstract: Online strategic classification studies settings in which agents strategically modify their features to obtain favorable predictions. For example, given a classifier that determines loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close credit cards and bank accounts to obtain a positive prediction. The learning goal is to achieve low mistake or regret bounds despite such strategic behavior.
  While randomized algorithms have the potential to offer advantages to the learner in strategic settings, they have been largely underexplored. In the realizable setting, no lower bound is known for randomized algorithms, and existing lower bound constructions for deterministic learners can be circumvented by randomization. In the agnostic setting, the best known regret upper bound is $O(T^{3/4}\log^{1/4}T|\mathcal H|)$, which is far from the standard online learning rate of $O(\sqrt{T\log|\mathcal H|})$.
  In this work, we provide refined bounds for online strategic classification in both settings. In the realizable setting, we extend, for $T > \mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ^2$, the existing lower bound $Ω(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ)$ for deterministic learners to all learners. This yields the first lower bound that applies to randomized learners. We also provide the first randomized learner that improves the known (deterministic) upper bound of $O(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal H) \cdot Δ\log Δ)$.
  In the agnostic setting, we give a proper learner using convex optimization techniques to improve the regret upper bound to $O(\sqrt{T \log |\mathcal{H}|} + |\mathcal{H}| \log(T|\mathcal{H}|))$. We show a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors for all proper learning rules, demonstrating the optimality of our learner among proper learners. As such, improper learning is necessary to further improve regret guarantees.

Conclusion: GRP-Oblit为安全对齐提供了新的脆弱性揭示工具，表明当前对齐机制易被轻量攻击突破，亟需更鲁棒的防护策略。

Abstract: Safety alignment is only as robust as its weakest failure mode. Despite extensive work on safety post-training, it has been shown that models can be readily unaligned through post-deployment fine-tuning. However, these methods often require extensive data curation and degrade model utility.
  In this work, we extend the practical limits of unalignment by introducing GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly remove safety constraints from target models. We show that a single unlabeled prompt is sufficient to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while largely preserving their utility, and that GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, GRP-Oblit generalizes beyond language models and can also unalign diffusion-based image generation systems.
  We evaluate GRP-Oblit on six utility benchmarks and five safety benchmarks across fifteen 7-20B parameter models, spanning instruct and reasoning models, as well as dense and MoE architectures. The evaluated model families include GPT-OSS, distilled DeepSeek, Gemma, Llama, Ministral, and Qwen.

Conclusion: 本工作统一并强化了均衡计算与在线学习中的交换后悔最小化，揭示了最优性与计算效率间的根本权衡。

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing different notions of swap regret in online optimization. These forms of regret are tightly connected to correlated equilibrium concepts in games, and have been more recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability against strategic adversaries. The only computationally efficient algorithm for minimizing linear swap regret over a general convex set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ was developed recently by Daskalakis, Farina, Fishelson, Pipis, and Schneider (STOC '25). However, it incurs a highly suboptimal regret bound of $Ω(d^4 \sqrt{T})$ and also relies on computationally intensive calls to the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration.
  In this paper, we develop a significantly simpler, computationally efficient algorithm that guarantees $O(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for a general convex set and $O(d \sqrt{T})$ when the set is centrally symmetric. Our approach leverages the powerful response-based approachability framework of Bernstein and Shimkin (JMLR '15) -- previously overlooked in the line of work on swap regret minimization -- combined with geometric preconditioning via the John ellipsoid. Our algorithm simultaneously minimizes profile swap regret, which was recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability. Moreover, we establish a matching information-theoretic lower bound: any learner must incur in expectation $Ω(d \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for large enough $T$, even when the set is centrally symmetric. This also shows that the classic algorithm of Gordon, Greenwald, and Marks (ICML '08) is existentially optimal for minimizing linear swap regret, although it is computationally inefficient. Finally, we extend our approach to minimize regret with respect to the set of swap deviations with polynomial dimension, unifying and strengthening recent results in equilibrium computation and online learning.

Conclusion: 确定性去噪结合得分模型与锐度感知优化，可有效提升模型对抗鲁棒性，且具有理论收敛保证。

Abstract: We propose a novel deterministic purification method to improve adversarial robustness by mapping a potentially adversarial sample toward a nearby sample that lies close to a mode of the data distribution, where classifiers are more reliable. We design the method to be deterministic to ensure reliable test accuracy and to prevent the degradation of effective robustness observed in stochastic purification approaches when the adversary has full knowledge of the system and its randomness. We employ a score model trained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error of noise-corrupted data, thereby learning the structural characteristics of the input data distribution. Given a potentially adversarial input, the method searches within its local neighborhood for a purified sample that minimizes the expected reconstruction error under noise corruption and then feeds this purified sample to the classifier. During purification, sharpness-aware minimization is used to guide the purified samples toward flat regions of the expected reconstruction error landscape, thereby enhancing robustness. We further show that, as the noise level decreases, minimizing the expected reconstruction error biases the purified sample toward local maximizers of the Gaussian-smoothed density; under additional local assumptions on the score model, we prove recovery of a local maximizer in the small-noise limit. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods under strong deterministic white-box attacks.

Abstract: We address the problem of training conversion prediction models in advertising domains under privacy constraints, where direct links between ad clicks and conversions are unavailable. Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets. Simple empirical evaluations on standard datasets suggest our unbiased approach significantly outperforms common industry heuristics, particularly in regimes where attribution sets are large or overlapping.

Abstract: Exploiting sparsity during long-context inference is central to scaling large language models, as attention dominates the cost of autoregressive decoding. Sparse attention reduces this cost by restricting computation to a subset of tokens, but its effectiveness depends critically on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens at inference time. We revisit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a sparsification primitive and introduce SOCKET, a SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator that replaces hard bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that hard LSH produces discrete collision signals and is therefore poorly suited for ranking. In contrast, soft LSH aggregates graded collision evidence across hash tables, preserving the stability of relative ordering among the true top-$k$ tokens. This transformation elevates LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic to a principled and mathematically grounded scoring kernel for sparse attention. Leveraging this property, SOCKET enables efficient token selection without ad-hoc voting mechanism, and matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse set of models. With a custom CUDA kernel for scoring keys and a Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention, SOCKET achieves up to 1.5$\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention, making it an effective tool for long-context inference.

Conclusion: cVAE是一种数学透明、计算高效且可解释的生成模型，为气候不确定性量化提供了可行且实用的机器学习路径。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying uncertainty in predictions and projections arising from irreducible internal climate variability is critical for informed decision making. Such uncertainty is typically assessed using ensembles produced with physics based climate models. However, computational constraints impose a trade off between generating the large ensembles required for robust uncertainty estimation and increasing model resolution to better capture fine scale dynamics. Generative machine learning offers a promising pathway to alleviate these constraints. We develop a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) trained on a limited sample of climate simulations to generate arbitrary large ensembles. The approach is applied to output from monthly CMIP6 historical and future scenario experiments produced with the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis' (CCCma's) Earth system model CanESM5. We show that the cVAE model learns the underlying distribution of the data and generates physically consistent samples that reproduce realistic low and high moment statistics, including extremes. Compared with more sophisticated generative architectures, cVAEs offer a mathematically transparent, interpretable, and computationally efficient framework. Their simplicity lead to some limitations, such as overly smooth outputs, spectral bias, and underdispersion, that we discuss along with strategies to mitigate them. Specifically, we show that incorporating output noise improves the representation of climate relevant multiscale variability, and we propose a simple method to achieve this. Finally, we show that cVAE-enhanced ensembles capture realistic global teleconnection patterns, even under climate conditions absent from the training data.

Abstract: We present the Condensate Theorem: attention sparsity is a learned topological property, not an architectural constraint. Through empirical analysis of trained language models, we find that attention mass concentrates on a distinct topological manifold -- and this manifold can be identified dynamically without checking every position. We prove a general result: for any query, projecting attention onto the Condensate Manifold (Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k) achieves 100% output equivalence with full $O(n^2)$ attention. This is not an approximation -- it is lossless parity. We validate this across GPT-2, Pythia, Qwen2, TinyLlama, and Mistral, demonstrating bit-exact token matching on 1,500+ generated tokens. By mapping this topology to hardware, our Topological Attention kernel achieves a 159x measured speedup at 131K tokens (3.94ms vs 628ms) and a projected >1,200x speedup at 1M tokens, reducing inference costs by >99.9% compared to Flash Attention. We conclude that the quadratic bottleneck is an artifact of naive implementation, not intelligence.

Abstract: Epidemiological forecasting from surveillance data is a hard problem and hybridizing mechanistic compartmental models with neural models is a natural direction. The mechanistic structure helps keep trajectories epidemiologically plausible, while neural components can capture non-stationary, data-adaptive effects. In practice, however, many seemingly straightforward couplings fail under partial observability and continually shifting transmission dynamics driven by behavior, waning immunity, seasonality, and interventions. We catalog these failure modes and show that robust performance requires making non-stationarity explicit: we extract multi-scale structure from the observed infection series and use it as an interpretable control signal for a controlled neural ODE coupled to an epidemiological model. Concretely, we decompose infections into trend, seasonal, and residual components and use these signals to drive continuous-time latent dynamics while jointly forecasting and inferring time-varying transmission, recovery, and immunity-loss rates. Across seasonal and non-seasonal settings, including early outbreaks and multi-wave regimes, our approach reduces long-horizon RMSE by 15-35%, improves peak timing error by 1-3 weeks, and lowers peak magnitude bias by up to 30% relative to strong time-series, neural ODE, and hybrid baselines, without relying on auxiliary covariates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation often suffer from severe performance degradation when deployed in real-world environments due to non-stationary dynamics. While Domain Randomization (DR) and meta-RL have been proposed to address this issue, they typically rely on extensive pretraining, privileged information, or high computational cost, limiting their applicability to real-time and edge systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight online adaptation framework for RL based on Reservoir Computing. Specifically, we integrate an Echo State Networks (ESNs) as an adaptation module that encodes recent observation histories into a latent context representation, and update its readout weights online using Recursive Least Squares (RLS). This design enables rapid adaptation without backpropagation, pretraining, or access to privileged information. We evaluate the proposed method on CartPole and HalfCheetah tasks with severe and abrupt environment changes, including periodic external disturbances and extreme friction variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms DR and representative adaptive baselines under out-of-distribution dynamics, achieving stable adaptation within a few control steps. Notably, the method successfully handles intra-episode environment changes without resetting the policy. Due to its computational efficiency and stability, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for online adaptation in non-stationary environments and is well suited for real-world robotic control and edge deployment.

Abstract: Deploying trustworthy AI in open-world environments faces a dual challenge: the necessity for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure system safety, and the demand for flexible machine unlearning to satisfy privacy compliance and model rectification. However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.

Conclusion: 通过引入纯策略极大极小后悔和设计专用算法，首次在带宽反馈下实现对数后悔，突破传统外部后悔的限制。

Abstract: Learning to play zero-sum games is a fundamental problem in game theory and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in minimizing external regret in the self-play settings or with full-information feedback, real-world applications often force learners to play against unknown, arbitrary opponents and restrict learners to bandit feedback where only the payoff of the realized action is observable. In such challenging settings, it is well-known that $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ external regret is unavoidable (where T is the number of rounds). To overcome this barrier, we investigate adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, aiming to minimize the deficit against the maximin pure strategy -- a metric we term Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret.
  We analyze this problem under two bandit feedback models: uninformed (only the realized reward is revealed) and informed (both the reward and the opponent's action are revealed). For uninformed bandit learning of normal-form games, we show that the Tsallis-INF algorithm achieves $O(c \log T)$ instance-dependent regret with a game-dependent parameter $c$. Crucially, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that the dependence on c is necessary. To overcome this hardness, we turn to the informed setting and introduce Maximin-UCB, which obtains another regret bound of the form $O(c' \log T)$ for a different game-dependent parameter $c'$ that could potentially be much smaller than $c$. Finally, we generalize both results to bilinear games over an arbitrary, large action set, proposing Tsallis-FTRL-SPM and Maximin-LinUCB for the uninformed and informed setting respectively and establishing similar game-dependent logarithmic regret bounds.

Method: 提出ERDF，包含标签相关性特征增强和度量感知的特征重用机制

Result: 在六个评估指标上优于现有算法

Conclusion: ERDF通过增强与重用机制有效提升了标签分布学习的精度与稳定性

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) requires the learner to predict the degree of correlation between each sample and each label. To achieve this, a crucial task during learning is to leverage the correlation among labels. Deep Forest (DF) is a deep learning framework based on tree ensembles, whose training phase does not rely on backpropagation. DF performs in-model feature transform using the prediction of each layer and achieves competitive performance on many tasks. However, its exploration in the field of LDL is still in its infancy. The few existing methods that apply DF to the field of LDL do not have effective ways to utilize the correlation among labels. Therefore, we propose a method named Enhanced and Reused Feature Deep Forest (ERDF). It mainly contains two mechanisms: feature enhancement exploiting label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse. The first one is to utilize the correlation among labels to enhance the original features, enabling the samples to acquire more comprehensive information for the task of LDL. The second one performs a reuse operation on the features of samples that perform worse than the previous layer on the validation set, in order to ensure the stability of the training process. This kind of Enhance-Reuse pattern not only enables samples to enrich their features but also validates the effectiveness of their new features and conducts a reuse process to prevent the noise from spreading further. Experiments show that our method outperforms other comparison algorithms on six evaluation metrics.

Result: LLM生成分布在低数据场景下实用，且决策导向评估优于Wasserstein等决策无关指标。

Conclusion: 应使用决策性能而非分布相似性来评估LLM生成数据的质量。

Abstract: LLMs can generate a wealth of data, ranging from simulated personas imitating human valuations and preferences, to demand forecasts based on world knowledge. But how well do such LLM-generated distributions support downstream decision-making? For example, when pricing a new product, a firm could prompt an LLM to simulate how much consumers are willing to pay based on a product description, but how useful is the resulting distribution for optimizing the price? We refer to this approach as LLM-SAA, in which an LLM is used to construct an estimated distribution and the decision is then optimized under that distribution. In this paper, we study metrics to evaluate the quality of these LLM-generated distributions, based on the decisions they induce. Taking three canonical decision-making problems (assortment optimization, pricing, and newsvendor) as examples, we find that LLM-generated distributions are practically useful, especially in low-data regimes. We also show that decision-agnostic metrics such as Wasserstein distance can be misleading when evaluating these distributions for decision-making.

Conclusion: OGS通过数据层面的几何约束，有效解决灾难性遗忘，兼顾性能、效率与通用性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specialized domains often necessitates a trade-off between acquiring domain expertise and retaining general reasoning capabilities, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing remedies face a dichotomy: gradient surgery methods offer geometric safety but incur prohibitive computational costs via online projections, while efficient data selection approaches reduce overhead but remain blind to conflict-inducing gradient directions. In this paper, we propose Orthogonal Gradient Selection (OGS), a data-centric method that harmonizes domain performance, general capability retention, and training efficiency. OGS shifts the geometric insights of gradient projection from the optimizer to the data selection stage by treating data selection as a constrained decision-making process. By leveraging a lightweight Navigator model and reinforcement learning techniques, OGS dynamically identifies training samples whose gradients are orthogonal to a general-knowledge anchor. This approach ensures naturally safe updates for target models without modifying the optimizer or incurring runtime projection costs. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial domains demonstrate that OGS achieves excellent results, significantly improving domain performance and training efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance on general tasks such as GSM8K.

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了正交优化器在LoRA中的独特谱动力学，为理解其高效性提供了理论基础，并支持其优于传统梯度下降的收敛特性。

Abstract: Spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) orthogonalizes the matrix parameter updates and has inspired practical optimizers such as Muon. They often perform well in large language model (LLM) training, but their dynamics remain poorly understood. In the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) setting, where weight updates are parameterized as a product of two low-rank factors, we find a distinctive spectral phenomenon under Muon in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs: singular values of the LoRA product show near-uniform growth across the spectrum, despite orthogonalization being performed on the two factors separately. Motivated by this observation, we analyze spectral gradient flow (SpecGF)-a continuous-time analogue of SpecGD-in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting and prove "equal-rate" dynamics: all singular values grow at equal rates up to small deviations. Consequently, smaller singular values attain their target values earlier than larger ones, sharply contrasting with the largest-first stepwise learning observed in standard gradient flow. Moreover, we prove that SpecGF in our setting converges to global minima from almost all initializations, provided the factor norms remain bounded; with $\ell_2$ regularization, we obtain global convergence. Lastly, we corroborate our theory with experiments in the same setting.

Conclusion: 该框架可通用增强任何合成生成器，为阈值选择与后处理提供实用指导，与差分隐私方法互补。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data enables sharing and analysis of sensitive records, but its practical deployment requires balancing distributional fidelity, downstream utility, and privacy protection. We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged. These results provide practical guidance for selecting thresholds and applying post hoc repairs to improve the quality and empirical privacy of synthetic tabular data, while complementing approaches that provide formal differential privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: 该框架在分布式对抗与线性 bandit 中均达到理论最优，且通信效率高，具有普适性和扩展性。

Abstract: We study distributed adversarial bandits, where $N$ agents cooperate to minimize the global average loss while observing only their own local losses. We show that the minimax regret for this problem is $\tildeΘ(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+K/N)T})$, where $T$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of actions, and $ρ$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. Our algorithm, based on a novel black-box reduction to bandits with delayed feedback, requires agents to communicate only through gossip. It achieves an upper bound that significantly improves over the previous best bound $\tilde{O}(ρ^{-1/3}(KT)^{2/3})$ of Yi and Vojnovic (2023). We complement this result with a matching lower bound, showing that the problem's difficulty decomposes into a communication cost $ρ^{-1/4}\sqrt{T}$ and a bandit cost $\sqrt{KT/N}$. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by deriving first-order and best-of-both-worlds bounds in the distributed adversarial setting. Finally, we extend our framework to distributed linear bandits in $R^d$, obtaining a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+1/N)dT})$, achieved with only $O(d)$ communication cost per agent and per round via a volumetric spanner.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based emotion recognition plays a critical role in affective computing and emerging decision-support systems, yet remains challenging due to high-dimensional, noisy, and subject-dependent signals. This study investigates whether hybrid deep learning architectures that integrate convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based components can improve emotion classification performance and robustness in EEG data. We propose an enhanced hybrid model that combines convolutional feature extraction, bidirectional temporal modeling, and self-attention mechanisms with regularization strategies to mitigate overfitting. Experiments conducted on a publicly available EEG dataset spanning three emotional states (neutral, positive, and negative) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance, significantly outperforming classical machine learning and neural baselines. Statistical tests confirm the robustness of these performance gains under cross-validation. Feature-level analyses further reveal that covariance-based EEG features contribute most strongly to emotion discrimination, highlighting the importance of inter-channel relationships in affective modeling. These findings suggest that carefully designed hybrid architectures can effectively balance predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in EEG-based emotion recognition, with implications for applied affective computing and human-centered intelligent systems.

Abstract: Tokenization is a promising path to multi-modal models capable of jointly understanding protein sequences, structure, and function. Existing protein structure tokenizers create tokens by pooling information from local neighborhoods, an approach that limits their performance on generative and representation tasks. In this work, we present a method for global tokenization of protein structures in which successive tokens contribute increasing levels of detail to a global representation. This change resolves several issues with generative models based on local protein tokenization: it mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing models based on local protein structure tokenizers. We show how adaptive tokens enable inference criteria based on information content, which boosts designability. We validate representations generated from our tokenizer on CATH classification tasks and demonstrate that non-linear probing on our tokenized sequences outperforms equivalent probing on representations from other tokenizers. Finally, we demonstrate how our method supports zero-shot protein shrinking and affinity maturation.

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) projects rely on complex networks of contributors whose interactions drive innovation and sustainability. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of OSS contributor networks using advanced graph neural networks and temporal network analysis on data spanning 25 years from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem, encompassing sandbox, incubating, and graduated projects. Our analysis of thousands of contributors across hundreds of repositories reveals that OSS networks exhibit strong power-law distributions in influence, with the top 1\% of contributors controlling a substantial portion of network influence. Using GPU-accelerated PageRank, betweenness centrality, and custom LSTM models, we identify five distinct contributor roles: Core, Bridge, Connector, Regular, and Peripheral, each with unique network positions and structural importance. Statistical analysis reveals significant correlations between specific action types (commits, pull requests, issues) and contributor influence, with multiple regression models explaining substantial variance in influence metrics. Temporal analysis shows that network density, clustering coefficients, and modularity exhibit statistically significant temporal trends, with distinct regime changes coinciding with major project milestones. Structural integrity simulations show that Bridge contributors, despite representing a small fraction of the network, have a disproportionate impact on network cohesion when removed. Our findings provide empirical evidence for strategic contributor retention policies and offer actionable insights into community health metrics.

Conclusion: 该框架为概念水文模型的可微建模提供了高效、稳健且透明的优化途径，释放了不同iable建模的全部潜力。

Abstract: Conceptual hydrologic models remain the cornerstone of rainfall-runoff modeling, yet their calibration is often slow and numerically fragile. Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.

Conclusion: 模型外推是一种稳定且有效的机器遗忘新范式，优于传统梯度上升方法

Abstract: For ethical and safe AI, machine unlearning rises as a critical topic aiming to protect sensitive, private, and copyrighted knowledge from misuse. To achieve this goal, it is common to conduct gradient ascent (GA) to reverse the training on undesired data. However, such a reversal is prone to catastrophic collapse, which leads to serious performance degradation in general tasks. As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model. Counterfactual as it might sound, a forget model can be obtained via extrapolation from the memorization model to the reference model. Hence, we avoid directly acquiring the forget model using GA, but proceed with gradient descent for the memorization model, which successfully stabilizes the machine unlearning process. Our model extrapolation is simple and efficient to implement, and it can also effectively converge throughout training to achieve improved unlearning performance.

Conclusion: PiEvo通过动态演化科学原理，突破了传统静态假设的局限，显著提升LLM科学代理的通用性与效率

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based scientific agents have accelerated scientific discovery, yet they often suffer from significant inefficiencies due to adherence to fixed initial priors. Existing approaches predominantly operate within a static hypothesis space, which restricts the discovery of novel phenomena, resulting in computational waste when baseline theories fail. To address this, we propose shifting the focus from searching hypotheses to evolving the underlying scientific principles. We present PiEvo, a principle-evolvable framework that treats scientific discovery as Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space. By integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism, PiEvo enables agents to autonomously refine their theoretical worldview. Evaluation across four benchmarks demonstrates that PiEvo (1) achieves an average solution quality of up to 90.81%~93.15%, representing a 29.7%~31.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art, (2) attains an 83.3% speedup in convergence step via significantly reduced sample complexity by optimizing the compact principle space, and (3) maintains robust performance across diverse scientific domains and LLM backbones.

Conclusion: BrokenBind提供了一种灵活、可扩展的多模态学习框架，显著提升模型在未见模态组合上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning combines various modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of real-world problems. A common strategy is to directly bind different modalities together in a specific joint embedding space. However, the capability of existing methods is restricted within the modalities presented in the given dataset, thus they are biased when generalizing to unpresented modalities in downstream tasks. As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets. To achieve this, BrokenBind simultaneously leverages multiple datasets containing the modalities of interest and one shared modality. Though the two datasets do not correspond to each other due to distribution mismatch, we can capture their relationship to generate pseudo embeddings to fill in the missing modalities of interest, enabling flexible and generalized multi-modal learning. Under our framework, any two modalities can be bound together, free from the dataset limitation, to achieve universal modality exploration. Further, to reveal the capability of our method, we study intensified scenarios where more than two datasets are needed for modality binding and show the effectiveness of BrokenBind in low-data regimes. Through extensive evaluation, we carefully justify the superiority of BrokenBind compared to well-known multi-modal baseline methods.

Result: 实验表明PCR显著平滑训练轨迹，在多种推理任务中实现更优性能。

Conclusion: PCR通过引入概率建模有效缓解GRPO中的梯度冲突，为组策略优化提供了更稳健的训练框架。

Abstract: Training stability remains a critical bottleneck for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often manifesting as a trade-off between reasoning plasticity and general capability retention. We identify a root cause as the geometric conflict between plasticity and stability gradients, which leads to destructive interference. Crucially, we argue that deterministic projection methods are suboptimal for GRPO as they overlook the intrinsic stochasticity of group-based gradient estimates. To address this, we propose Probabilistic Conflict Resolution (PCR), a Bayesian framework that models gradients as random variables. PCR dynamically arbitrates conflicts via an uncertainty-aware ``soft projection'' mechanism, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCR significantly smooths the training trajectory and achieves superior performance in various reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Non-stationarity of an underlying data generating process that leads to distributional changes over time is a key characteristic of Data Streams. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as Concept Drift, has been intensively studied, and Concept Drift Detectors have been established as a class of methods for detecting such changes (drifts). For the most part, Drift Detectors compare regions (windows) of the data stream and detect drift if those windows are sufficiently dissimilar.
  In this work, we introduce the Window Dilemma, an observation that perceived drift is a product of windowing and not necessarily the underlying data generating process. Additionally, we highlight that drift detection is ill-posed, primarily because verification of drift events are implausible in practice. We demonstrate these contributions first by an illustrative example, followed by empirical comparisons of drift detectors against a variety of alternative adaptation strategies. Our main finding is that traditional batch learning techniques often perform better than their drift-aware counterparts further bringing into question the purpose of detectors in Stream Classification.

Conclusion: 本文首次建立了在线双层优化的最优遗憾界，为相关算法设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Online bilevel optimization (OBO) has emerged as a powerful framework for many machine learning problems. Prior works have developed several algorithms that minimize the standard bilevel local regret or the window-averaged bilevel local regret of the OBO problem, but the optimality of existing regret bounds remains unclear. In this work, we establish optimal regret bounds for both settings. For standard bilevel local regret, we propose an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret $Ω(1+V_T)$ with at most $O(T\log T)$ total inner-level gradient evaluations. We further develop a fully single-loop algorithm whose regret bound includes an additional gradient-variation terms. For the window-averaged bilevel local regret, we design an algorithm that captures sublinear environmental variation through a window-based analysis and achieves the optimal regret $Ω(T/W^2)$. Experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Conclusion: 通过因果反事实视角建模推理过程，能有效引导大模型学习可泛化的推理模式，而非仅依赖答案正确性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks with advances in reasoning capabilities. However, existing reward mechanisms remain tightly coupled to final correctness and pay little attention to the underlying reasoning process: trajectories with sound reasoning but wrong answers receive low credit, while lucky guesses with flawed logic may be highly rewarded, affecting reasoning generalization. From a causal perspective, we interpret multi-candidate reasoning for a fixed question as a family of counterfactual experiments with theoretical supports. Building on this, we propose Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to explicitly train LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning patterns. It proposes an episodic causal counterfactual reward that jointly captures (i) robustness, encouraging the answer distribution induced by a reasoning step to remain stable under counterfactual perturbations; and (ii) effectiveness, enforcing sufficient variability so that the learned reasoning strategy can transfer across questions. We then construct token-level advantages from this reward and optimize the policy, encouraging LLMs to favor reasoning patterns that are process-valid and counterfactually robust. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate its advantages.

Abstract: Inference-time reasoning scaling has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving. A prevalent approach involves external search guided by Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, a fundamental limitation of this framework is the epistemic uncertainty of PRMs when evaluating reasoning paths that deviate from their training distribution. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of this challenge. We first provide empirical evidence that PRMs exhibit high uncertainty and unreliable scoring on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We then establish a theoretical framework proving that while standard search incurs linear regret accumulation, an uncertainty-aware strategy can achieve sublinear regret. Motivated by these findings, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS), a unified method that estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo Dropout and dynamically allocates compute budget using a reinforcement learning-based controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the impact of OOD errors.

Abstract: Scaling inference methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo to high-dimensional models remains a central challenge in Bayesian deep learning. A promising recent proposal, microcanonical Langevin Monte Carlo, has shown state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of problems. However, its reliance on full-dataset gradients makes it prohibitively expensive for large-scale problems. This paper addresses a fundamental question: Can microcanonical dynamics effectively leverage mini-batch gradient noise? We provide the first systematic study of this problem, establishing a novel continuous-time theoretical analysis of stochastic-gradient microcanonical dynamics. We reveal two critical failure modes: a theoretically derived bias due to anisotropic gradient noise and numerical instabilities in complex high-dimensional posteriors. To tackle these issues, we propose a principled gradient noise preconditioning scheme shown to significantly reduce this bias and develop a novel, energy-variance-based adaptive tuner that automates step size selection and dynamically informs numerical guardrails. The resulting algorithm is a robust and scalable microcanonical Monte Carlo sampler that achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging high-dimensional inference tasks like Bayesian neural networks. Combined with recent ensemble techniques, our work unlocks a new class of stochastic microcanonical Langevin ensemble (SMILE) samplers for large-scale Bayesian inference.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show strong promise for complex reasoning, planning, and tool-augmented tasks, but designing effective MAS architectures remains labor-intensive, brittle, and hard to generalize. Existing automatic MAS generation methods either rely on code generation, which often leads to executability and robustness failures, or impose rigid architectural templates that limit expressiveness and adaptability. We propose Evolutionary Generation of Multi-Agent Systems (EvoMAS), which formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation. EvoMAS performs evolutionary generation in configuration space. Specifically, EvoMAS selects initial configurations from a pool, applies feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces, and iteratively refines both the candidate pool and an experience memory. We evaluate EvoMAS on diverse benchmarks, including BBEH, SWE-Bench, and WorkBench, covering reasoning, software engineering, and tool-use tasks. EvoMAS consistently improves task performance over both human-designed MAS and prior automatic MAS generation methods, while producing generated systems with higher executability and runtime robustness. EvoMAS outperforms the agent evolution method EvoAgent by +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench. With Claude-4.5-Sonnet, EvoMAS also reaches 79.1% on SWE-Bench-Verified, matching the top of the leaderboard.

Abstract: Deep knowledge tracing models have achieved significant breakthroughs in modeling student learning trajectories. However, these architectures require substantial training time and are prone to overfitting on datasets with short sequences. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for knowledge tracing by leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs). Unlike traditional methods that require offline training on a fixed training set, our approach performs real-time ''live'' knowledge tracing in an online way. The core of our method lies in a two-way attention mechanism: while attention knowledge tracing models only attend across earlier time steps, TFMs simultaneously attend across both time steps and interactions of other students in the training set. They align testing sequences with relevant training sequences at inference time, therefore skipping the training step entirely. We demonstrate, using several datasets of increasing size, that our method achieves competitive predictive performance with up to 273x speedups, in a setting where more student interactions are observed over time.

Conclusion: AdverISF无需显式标签即可有效分离噪声与有用特征，为低数据场景下的科学建模提供新范式。

Abstract: Generalizing from limited data is particularly critical for models in domains such as material science, where task-relevant features in experimental datasets are often heavily confounded by measurement noise and experimental artifacts. Standard regularization techniques fail to precisely separate meaningful features from noise, while existing adversarial adaptation methods are limited by their reliance on explicit separation labels. To address this challenge, we propose the Adversarial Information Separation Framework (AdverISF), which isolates task-relevant features from noise without requiring explicit supervision. AdverISF introduces a self-supervised adversarial mechanism to enforce statistical independence between task-relevant features and noise representations. It further employs a multi-layer separation architecture that progressively recycles noise information across feature hierarchies to recover features inadvertently discarded as noise, thereby enabling finer-grained feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdverISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios. In addition, evaluations on real-world material design tasks show that it achieves superior generalization performance.

Motivation: 在潜变量情境下，传统方法难以处理执行器反转等动态不连续问题，导致零样本泛化失败。

Method: 提出DMA*-SH框架，使用单一超网络通过动力学预测训练，生成共享适配权重，结合输入归一化和随机掩码稳定情境推断。

Conclusion: 超网络调制结合结构化正则化可有效提升潜情境下的泛化能力，为复杂动态环境中的零样本学习提供新路径。

Abstract: Zero-shot generalization in contextual reinforcement learning remains a core challenge, particularly when the context is latent and must be inferred from data. A canonical failure mode is actuator inversion, where identical actions produce opposite physical effects under a latent binary context. We propose DMA*-SH, a framework where a single hypernetwork, trained solely via dynamics prediction, generates a small set of adapter weights shared across the dynamics model, policy, and action-value function. This shared modulation imparts an inductive bias matched to actuator inversion, while input/output normalization and random input masking stabilize context inference, promoting directionally concentrated representations. We provide theoretical support via an expressivity separation result for hypernetwork modulation, and a variance decomposition with policy-gradient variance bounds that formalize how within-mode compression improves learning under actuator inversion. For evaluation, we introduce the Actuator Inversion Benchmark (AIB), a suite of environments designed to isolate discontinuous context-to-dynamics interactions. On AIB's held-out actuator-inversion tasks, DMA*-SH achieves zero-shot generalization, outperforming domain randomization by 111.8% and surpassing a standard context-aware baseline by 16.1%.

Motivation: 现有实例特定模型合并方法缺乏可重用性，且将任务模型视为整体，忽视了同源组件（如注意力与MLP层）的差异化可合并性与敏感性。

Method: MERGE将组件级合并建模为双目标优化问题，使用代理辅助进化算法寻找帕累托最优配置，构建可重用模块专家库，并通过轻量路由网络动态重组模块以生成输入特定模型。

Conclusion: 模块化细粒度合并与输入感知重组能有效提升模型合并的效率、可重用性与性能，为高效多任务模型部署提供新范式。

Abstract: Model merging constructs versatile models by integrating task-specific models without requiring labeled data or expensive joint retraining. Although recent methods improve adaptability to heterogeneous tasks by generating customized merged models for each instance, they face two critical limitations. First, the instance-specific merged models lack reusability, restricting the exploitation of high-quality merging configurations and efficient batch inference. Second, these methods treat each task-specific model as a monolithic whole, overlooking the diverse mergeability of homologous components such as attention and multilayer perceptron layers, and the differing merging sensitivities across components. To address these limitations, we propose MERGE (\underline{M}odular \underline{E}xpert \underline{R}ecombination for fine-\underline{G}rained m\underline{E}rging), a method that enables component-wise model merging and input-aware, on-demand module recombination at inference. MERGE formulates component-wise merging as a bi-objective optimization problem that balances cross-task performance and storage efficiency, and develops a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to efficiently identify Pareto-optimal merging configurations. These high-quality configurations underpin a reusable modular expert library, from which a lightweight routing network dynamically activates and recombines modular experts to assemble input-specific models and enable efficient inference under storage constraints. Extensive experiments across various model scales, task types, and fine-tuning strategies demonstrate that MERGE consistently outperforms strong baselines and generalizes effectively.

Result: 提出一种无需训练即可高效排名和选择最优GSO的理论框架，显著降低搜索开销。

Conclusion: 该方法为GSO选择提供了理论基础与实用工具，推动图神经网络的可解释性与效率提升。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have established themselves as the leading models for learning on graph-structured data, generally categorized into spatial and spectral approaches. Central to these architectures is the Graph Shift Operator (GSO), a matrix representation of the graph structure used to filter node signals. However, selecting the optimal GSO, whether fixed or learnable, remains largely empirical. In this paper, we introduce a novel alignment gain metric that quantifies the geometric distortion between the input signal and label subspaces. Crucially, our theoretical analysis connects this alignment directly to generalization bounds via a spectral proxy for the Lipschitz constant. This yields a principled, computation-efficient criterion to rank and select the optimal GSO for any prediction task prior to training, eliminating the need for extensive search.

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理预算分配与双重随机条件（激活概率+阈值）下的联合参数估计与探索-利用权衡问题。

Method: 提出RA-UCB算法（已知预算）和MG-UCB算法（动态预算），结合置信上界与参数估计，实现高效在线决策。

Result: 证明了Ω(T^{1/3})的下界，RA-UCB达到	ilde{O}(oot T)或多项式对数 regret，MG-UCB在动态预算下保持相同性能。

Conclusion: 所提算法在理论与实验上均显著优于基线，为带复杂反馈的预算分配问题提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: We study the online resource allocation problem in which at each round, a budget $B$ must be allocated across $K$ arms under censored feedback. An arm yields a reward if and only if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the arm is activated according to an arm-specific Bernoulli random variable with unknown parameter, and (ii) the allocated budget exceeds a random threshold drawn from a parametric distribution with unknown parameter. Over $T$ rounds, the learner must jointly estimate the unknown parameters and allocate the budget so as to maximize cumulative reward facing the exploration--exploitation trade-off. We prove an information-theoretic regret lower bound $Ω(T^{1/3})$, demonstrating the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. We then propose RA-UCB, an optimistic algorithm that leverages non-trivial parameter estimation and confidence bounds. When the budget $B$ is known at the beginning of each round, RA-UCB achieves a regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$, and even $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}\text{-}\log T)$ under stronger assumptions. As for unknown, round dependent budget, we introduce MG-UCB, which allows within-round switching and infinitesimal allocations, and matches the regret guarantees of RA-UCB. We then validate our theoretical results through experiments on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Transformer网络为CEST数据定量提供高效精准的新途径。

Abstract: Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality for detecting metabolites. It offers higher resolution and sensitivity compared to conventional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). However, quantification of CEST data is challenging because the measured signal results from a complex interplay of many physiological variables. Here, we introduce a transformer-based neural network to fit parameters such as metabolite concentrations, exchange and relaxation rates of a physical model derived from Bloch-McConnell equations to in-vitro CEST spectra. We show that our self-supervised trained neural network clearly outperforms the solution of classical gradient-based solver.

Method: 设计Phase Attacks专门攻击复值输入的相位信息，并推导出复值版本的常用对抗攻击方法。

Result: Phase Attacks比同等强度的常规攻击更能降低模型性能，表明CVNN对相位变化高度敏感；但在某些场景下CVNN比RVNN更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 复值神经网络的相位信息是其脆弱性的关键，需在实际应用中特别关注相位鲁棒性。

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are rising in popularity for all kinds of applications. To safely use CVNNs in practice, analyzing their robustness against outliers is crucial. One well known technique to understand the behavior of deep neural networks is to investigate their behavior under adversarial attacks, which can be seen as worst case minimal perturbations. We design Phase Attacks, a kind of attack specifically targeting the phase information of complex-valued inputs. Additionally, we derive complex-valued versions of commonly used adversarial attacks. We show that in some scenarios CVNNs are more robust than RVNNs and that both are very susceptible to phase changes with the Phase Attacks decreasing the model performance more, than equally strong regular attacks, which can attack both phase and magnitude.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击多使用ℓ_1、ℓ_2或ℓ_∞范数，但缺乏系统分析p值如何影响攻击的结构与感知特性。

Method: 引入两种稀疏性度量和三种平滑性度量（包括基于平滑操作和一阶泰勒近似的新型度量），在多种数据集和模型上进行实证评估。

Result: ℓ_1和ℓ_2并非最优，p∈[1.3,1.5]在稀疏性与平滑性之间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 对抗攻击的范数选择应基于任务进行原则性优化，而非默认使用传统范数。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks are commonly constructed under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, most often using $p=1$, $p=2$ or $p=\infty$, and potentially regularized for specific demands such as sparsity or smoothness. These choices are typically made without a systematic investigation of how the norm parameter \( p \) influences the structural and perceptual properties of adversarial perturbations. In this work, we study how the choice of \( p \) affects sparsity and smoothness of adversarial attacks generated under \( \ell_p \) norm constraints for values of $p \in [1,2]$. To enable a quantitative analysis, we adopt two established sparsity measures from the literature and introduce three smoothness measures. In particular, we propose a general framework for deriving smoothness measures based on smoothing operations and additionally introduce a smoothness measure based on first-order Taylor approximations. Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks. We show that the choice of $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ is suboptimal in most cases and the optimal $p$ value is dependent on the specific task. In our experiments, using $\ell_p$ norms with $p\in [1.3, 1.5]$ yields the best trade-off between sparse and smooth attacks. These findings highlight the importance of principled norm selection when designing and evaluating adversarial attacks.

Motivation: 传统初始化方法（如Xavier、Kaiming）依赖随机采样，未利用优化过程信息，导致收敛慢，尤其在隐式神经表示和DIP类网络中低频偏差严重。

Method: 使用随机噪声作为目标，对网络进行自监督预训练，获得结构化非随机参数初始化，无需额外数据或架构修改。

Result: 预训练后网络能更早捕捉高频成分，显著加快后续任务收敛速度，提升训练稳定性，适用于INRs和DIP类模型。

Conclusion: 基于噪声的预训练是一种轻量、通用的初始化替代方案，无需语义信息即可有效引导网络参数结构，优化深度网络训练效率。

Abstract: Weight initialization plays a crucial role in the optimization behavior and convergence efficiency of neural networks. Most existing initialization methods, such as Xavier and Kaiming initializations, rely on random sampling and do not exploit information from the optimization process itself. We propose a simple, yet effective, initialization strategy based on self-supervised pre-training using random noise as the target. Instead of directly training the network from random weights, we first pre-train it to fit random noise, which leads to a structured and non-random parameter configuration. We show that this noise-driven pre-training significantly improves convergence speed in subsequent tasks, without requiring additional data or changes to the network architecture. The proposed method is particularly effective for implicit neural representations (INRs) and Deep Image Prior (DIP)-style networks, which are known to exhibit a strong low-frequency bias during optimization. After noise-based pre-training, the network is able to capture high-frequency components much earlier in training, leading to faster and more stable convergence. Although random noise contains no semantic information, it serves as an effective self-supervised signal (considering its white spectrum nature) for shaping the initialization of neural networks. Overall, this work demonstrates that noise-based pre-training offers a lightweight and general alternative to traditional random initialization, enabling more efficient optimization of deep neural networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习面临可塑性-稳定性权衡，特征空间趋向各向异性，而中心化训练中各向同性有助于泛化，因此探究是否应引入各向同性正则化以缓解灾难性遗忘。

Method: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上使用对比持续学习方法，通过实验验证各向同性正则化对模型性能的影响。

Result: 各向同性正则化未能提升持续学习准确率，甚至导致性能下降，表明其在非平稳数据场景中无效。

Conclusion: 中心化学习与持续学习的特征几何存在本质差异，各向同性虽有益于中心化训练，但不适用于持续学习场景。

Abstract: Centralized training is the standard paradigm in deep learning, enabling models to learn from a unified dataset in a single location. In such setup, isotropic feature distributions naturally arise as a mean to support well-structured and generalizable representations. In contrast, continual learning operates on streaming and non-stationary data, and trains models incrementally, inherently facing the well-known plasticity-stability dilemma. In such settings, learning dynamics tends to yield increasingly anisotropic feature space. This arises a fundamental question: should isotropy be enforced to achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity, and thereby mitigate catastrophic forgetting? In this paper, we investigate whether promoting feature-space isotropy can enhance representation quality in continual learning. Through experiments using contrastive continual learning techniques on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data, we find that isotropic regularization fails to improve, and can in fact degrade, model accuracy in continual settings. Our results highlight essential differences in feature geometry between centralized and continual learning, suggesting that isotropy, while beneficial in centralized setups, may not constitute an appropriate inductive bias for non-stationary learning scenarios.

Method: 设计DiTS架构，采用双流Transformer块：Time Attention建模时间维度自回归依赖，Variate Attention建模跨变量依赖，并利用多变量依赖的低秩特性降低计算成本。

Result: DiTS在多个基准上达到SOTA性能，无论是否存在未来外生变量观测，均优于传统确定性深度预测模型。

Conclusion: DiTS通过模态分离与双流结构有效建模多维时序依赖，为生成式时序预测提供了新范式。

Abstract: While generative modeling on time series facilitates more capable and flexible probabilistic forecasting, existing generative time series models do not address the multi-dimensional properties of time series data well. The prevalent architecture of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which relies on simplistic conditioning controls and a single-stream Transformer backbone, tends to underutilize cross-variate dependencies in covariate-aware forecasting. Inspired by Multimodal Diffusion Transformers that integrate textual guidance into video generation, we propose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series (DiTS), a general-purpose architecture that frames endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities. To better capture both inter-variate and intra-variate dependencies, we design a dual-stream Transformer block tailored for time-series data, comprising a Time Attention module for autoregressive modeling along the temporal dimension and a Variate Attention module for cross-variate modeling. Unlike the common approach for images, which flattens 2D token grids into 1D sequences, our design leverages the low-rank property inherent in multivariate dependencies, thereby reducing computational costs. Experiments show that DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, regardless of the presence of future exogenous variate observations, demonstrating unique generative forecasting strengths over traditional deterministic deep forecasting models.

Method: 通过网格世界导航任务和UVA/Padova糖尿病模拟器，分析时间重采样对ORL算法的影响，并提出三种失败机制。

Result: 时间重采样显著降低部署性能，且标准离线策略评估指标无法察觉性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前医疗ORL流程存在根本性风险，亟需能显式处理临床决策不规则时序的方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has shown potential for improving decision-making in healthcare. However, contemporary research typically aggregates patient data into fixed time intervals, simplifying their mapping to standard ORL frameworks. The impact of these temporal manipulations on model safety and efficacy remains poorly understood. In this work, using both a gridworld navigation task and the UVA/Padova clinical diabetes simulator, we demonstrate that temporal resampling significantly degrades the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms during live deployment. We propose three mechanisms that drive this failure: (i) the generation of counterfactual trajectories, (ii) the distortion of temporal expectations, and (iii) the compounding of generalisation errors. Crucially, we find that standard off-policy evaluation metrics can fail to detect these drops in performance. Our findings reveal a fundamental risk in current healthcare ORL pipelines and emphasise the need for methods that explicitly handle the irregular timing of clinical decision-making.

Result: 发现9种接近需求的合成数据生成方法，但均需访问真实数据；现有方法均未支持合成数据的动态演化。

Conclusion: 当前无方法完全满足要求，合成数据演化是亟待探索的新方向，尤其在新法规背景下对数字政府解决方案至关重要。

Abstract: Background: High-level system testing of applications that use data from e-Government services as input requires test data that is real-life-like but where the privacy of personal information is guaranteed. Applications with such strong requirement include information exchange between countries, medicine, banking, etc. This review aims to synthesize the current state-of-the-practice in this domain.
  Objectives: The objective of this Systematic Review is to identify existing approaches for creating and evolving synthetic test data without using real-life raw data.
  Methods: We followed well-known methodologies for conducting systematic literature reviews, including the ones from Kitchenham as well as guidelines for analysing the limitations of our review and its threats to validity.
  Results: A variety of methods and tools exist for creating privacy-preserving test data. Our search found 1,013 publications in IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and SCOPUS. We extracted data from 75 of those publications and identified 37 approaches that answer our research question partly. A common prerequisite for using these methods and tools is direct access to real-life data for data anonymization or synthetic test data generation. Nine existing synthetic test data generation approaches were identified that were closest to answering our research question. Nevertheless, further work would be needed to add the ability to evolve synthetic test data to the existing approaches.
  Conclusions: None of the publications really covered our requirements completely, only partially. Synthetic test data evolution is a field that has not received much attention from researchers but needs to be explored in Digital Government Solutions, especially since new legal regulations are being placed in force in many countries.

Conclusion: Adaptive-CaRe为医疗预测中准确性与因果鲁棒性的权衡提供了简单有效的解决方案，未来可探索更复杂模型与因果框架。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of outcomes is crucial for clinical decision-making and personalized patient care. Supervised machine learning algorithms, which are commonly used for outcome prediction in the medical domain, optimize for predictive accuracy, which can result in models latching onto spurious correlations instead of robust predictors. Causal structure learning methods on the other hand have the potential to provide robust predictors for the target, but can be too conservative because of algorithmic and data assumptions, resulting in loss of diagnostic precision. Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $λ$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings. Therefore, Adaptive-CaRe provides a simple yet effective solution to the long-standing trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness in the medical domain. Future work would involve studying alternate causal structure learning frameworks and complex classification models to provide deeper insights at a larger scale.

Motivation: KL散度仅控制平均差异，无法有效防止罕见但剧烈的概率比波动，而这类波动正是PPO剪裁等启发式方法试图解决的问题

Method: 提出基于Bhattacharyya系数的信任区域方法，推导出BTRPO和BPPO，分别通过二次惩罚和平方根比率剪裁来约束分布重叠

Result: 在相同训练预算下，基于重叠的约束方法在RLiable评估中展现出更优的鲁棒性和综合性能

Conclusion: Bhattacharyya重叠约束为策略优化提供了一种更严谨、实用的KL替代方案，能更有效地控制尾部比率波动

Abstract: Standard trust-region methods constrain policy updates via Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, KL controls only an average divergence and does not directly prevent rare, large likelihood-ratio excursions that destabilize training--precisely the failure mode that motivates heuristics such as PPO's clipping. We propose overlap geometry as an alternative trust region, constraining distributional overlap via the Bhattacharyya coefficient (closely related to the Hellinger/Renyi-1/2 geometry). This objective penalizes separation in the ratio tails, yielding tighter control over likelihood-ratio excursions without relying on total variation bounds that can be loose in tail regimes. We derive Bhattacharyya-TRPO (BTRPO) and Bhattacharyya-PPO (BPPO), enforcing overlap constraints via square-root ratio updates: BPPO clips the square-root ratio q = sqrt(r), and BTRPO applies a quadratic Hellinger/Bhattacharyya penalty. Empirically, overlap-based updates improve robustness and aggregate performance as measured by RLiable under matched training budgets, suggesting overlap constraints as a practical, principled alternative to KL for stable policy optimization.

While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.

Abstract: Pruning at Initialisation methods discover sparse, trainable subnetworks before training, but their theoretical mechanisms remain elusive. Existing analyses are often limited to finite-width statistics, lacking a rigorous characterisation of the global sparsity patterns that emerge as networks grow large. In this work, we connect discrete pruning heuristics to graph limit theory via graphons, establishing the graphon limit of PaI masks. We introduce a Factorised Saliency Model that encompasses popular pruning criteria and prove that, under regularity conditions, the discrete masks generated by these algorithms converge to deterministic bipartite graphons. This limit framework establishes a novel topological taxonomy for sparse networks: while unstructured methods (e.g., Random, Magnitude) converge to homogeneous graphons representing uniform connectivity, data-driven methods (e.g., SNIP, GraSP) converge to heterogeneous graphons that encode implicit feature selection. Leveraging this continuous characterisation, we derive two fundamental theoretical results: (i) a Universal Approximation Theorem for sparse networks that depends only on the intrinsic dimension of active coordinate subspaces; and (ii) a Graphon-NTK generalisation bound demonstrating how the limit graphon modulates the kernel geometry to align with informative features. Our results transform the study of sparse neural networks from combinatorial graph problems into a rigorous framework of continuous operators, offering a new mechanism for analysing expressivity and generalisation in sparse neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结构化剪枝方法依赖重训练或多阶段优化，难以满足post-training部署需求，而Vision Transformer计算成本高，亟需高效剪枝方案。

Method: CORP将结构化剪枝建模为表示恢复问题，通过闭式岭回归求解，将被移除的MLP和注意力子结构的补偿直接融合到权重中，仅需少量无标签校准数据。

Result: 在DeiT-Huge上剪枝50%的MLP和注意力结构后，Top-1准确率仍达82.8%，剪枝耗时不足20分钟，显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: CORP实现了无需重训练的高效结构化剪枝，证明了Vision Transformer中存在大量表示冗余，为轻量化部署提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision Transformers achieve strong accuracy but incur high compute and memory cost. Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.

Conclusion: 记忆机制能有效缓解无记忆闭合的结构缺陷，为扩散/流匹配模型提供更稳定的长时预测框架

Abstract: Autoregressive generative PDE solvers can be accurate one step ahead yet drift over long rollouts, especially in coarse-to-fine regimes where each step must regenerate unresolved fine scales. This is the regime of diffusion and flow-matching generators: although their internal dynamics are Markovian, rollout stability is governed by per-step \emph{conditional law} errors. Using the Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism, we show that eliminating unresolved variables yields an exact resolved evolution with a Markov term, a memory term, and an orthogonal forcing, exposing a structural limitation of memoryless closures. Motivated by this, we introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features. Via disintegration, memory induces a structured conditional tail prior for unresolved scales and reduces the transport needed to populate missing frequencies. We prove Wasserstein stability of the resulting conditional kernel. We then derive discrete Grönwall rollout bounds that separate memory approximation from conditional generation error. Experiments on compressible flows with shocks and multiscale mixing show improved accuracy and markedly more stable long-horizon rollouts, with better fine-scale spectral and statistical fidelity.

Conclusion: NanoQuant 实现了低内存PTQ的新基准，推动大模型在消费硬件上的高效部署。

Abstract: Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware. For example, it compresses Llama2-70B by 25.8$\times$ in just 13 hours on a single H100, enabling a 70B model to operate on a consumer 8 GB GPU.

Abstract: Incorporating group symmetries via equivariance into neural networks has emerged as a robust approach for overcoming the efficiency and data demands of modern deep learning. While most existing approaches, such as group convolutions and averaging-based methods, focus on compact, finite, or low-dimensional groups with linear actions, this work explores how equivariance can be extended to infinite-dimensional groups. We propose a strategy designed to induce diffeomorphism equivariance in pre-trained neural networks via energy-based canonicalisation. Formulating equivariance as an optimisation problem allows us to access the rich toolbox of already established differentiable image registration methods. Empirical results on segmentation and classification tasks confirm that our approach achieves approximate equivariance and generalises to unseen transformations without relying on extensive data augmentation or retraining.

Motivation: 理解Transformer中grokking的机制，尤其是架构和优化如何通过归纳偏差影响学习行为。

Method: 通过调控Layer Normalization位置和优化超参数（如readout scale、学习率、权重衰减），分析特征演化与泛化行为。

Result: LN位置影响shortcut学习与注意力熵；readout scale作为lazy training控制变量可能被其他超参数混淆；特征连续演化，泛化与特征可压缩性正相关。

Conclusion: Groking在Transformer中并非简单的lazy-to-rich转变，而是受多因素归纳偏差共同调控的连续过程，泛化可由特征可压缩性预测。

Abstract: We investigate grokking in transformers through the lens of inductive bias: dispositions arising from architecture or optimization that let the network prefer one solution over another. We first show that architectural choices such as the position of Layer Normalization (LN) strongly modulates grokking speed. This modulation is explained by isolating how LN on specific pathways shapes shortcut-learning and attention entropy. Subsequently, we study how different optimization settings modulate grokking, inducing distinct interpretations of previously proposed controls such as readout scale. Particularly, we find that using readout scale as a control for lazy training can be confounded by learning rate and weight decay in our setting. Accordingly, we show that features evolve continuously throughout training, suggesting grokking in transformers can be more nuanced than a lazy-to-rich transition of the learning regime. Finally, we show how generalization predictably emerges with feature compressibility in grokking, across different modulators of inductive bias. Our code is released at https://tinyurl.com/y52u3cad.

Conclusion: 分词与高效注意力机制的结合为蛋白质从头设计提供了高效且高性能的新范式。

Abstract: Generative models for de novo protein backbone design have achieved remarkable success in creating novel protein structures. However, these diffusion-based approaches remain computationally intensive and slower than desired for large-scale structural exploration. While recent efforts like Proteina have introduced flow-matching to improve sampling efficiency, the potential of tokenization for structural compression and acceleration remains largely unexplored in the protein domain. In this work, we present SaDiT, a novel framework that accelerates protein backbone generation by integrating SaProt Tokenization with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. SaDiT leverages a discrete latent space to represent protein geometry, significantly reducing the complexity of the generation process while maintaining theoretical SE(3) equivalence. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce an IPA Token Cache mechanism that optimizes the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) layers by reusing computed token states during iterative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that SaDiT outperforms state-of-the-art models, including RFDiffusion and Proteina, in both computational speed and structural viability. We evaluate our model across unconditional backbone generation and fold-class conditional generation tasks, where SaDiT shows superior ability to capture complex topological features with high designability.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法如GRPO对所有提示和去噪步骤均匀采样，忽视样本学习价值差异与关键探索时刻的动态性。

Method: 提出AEGPO，利用相对注意力熵ΔEntropy评估样本价值，绝对注意力熵Entropy(t)识别关键去噪时刻，实现全局与局部双层自适应优化。

Result: 在文本到图像生成任务中，AEGPO相比GRPO显著加快收敛速度并提升对齐性能。

Conclusion: 注意力熵可作为高效双信号代理，指导自适应策略优化，是提升RLHF效率的关键路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) shows promise for aligning diffusion and flow models, yet policy optimization methods such as GRPO suffer from inefficient and static sampling strategies. These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments.
  To address this issue, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal attention dynamics during GRPO training and uncover a key insight: attention entropy can serve as a powerful dual-signal proxy. First, across different samples, the relative change in attention entropy (ΔEntropy), which reflects the divergence between the current policy and the base policy, acts as a robust indicator of sample learning value. Second, during the denoising process, the peaks of absolute attention entropy (Entropy(t)), which quantify attention dispersion, effectively identify critical timesteps where high-value exploration occurs.
  Building on this observation, we propose Adaptive Entropy-Guided Policy Optimization (AEGPO), a novel dual-signal, dual-level adaptive optimization strategy. At the global level, AEGPO uses ΔEntropy to dynamically allocate rollout budgets, prioritizing prompts with higher learning value. At the local level, it exploits the peaks of Entropy(t) to guide exploration selectively at critical high-dispersion timesteps rather than uniformly across all denoising steps.
  By focusing computation on the most informative samples and the most critical moments, AEGPO enables more efficient and effective policy optimization. Experiments on text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that AEGPO significantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior alignment performance compared to standard GRPO variants.

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解稀有正确轨迹被忽略问题，提升探索效率，为RLVR提供通用优化框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is commonly based on group sampling to estimate advantages and stabilize policy updates. In practice, large group sizes are not feasible due to computational limits, which biases learning toward trajectories that are already likely. Smaller groups often miss rare-correct trajectories while still containing mixed rewards, concentrating probability on common solutions. We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient, inspired by Focal loss, that down-weights updates on high-success prompts. The lightweight modification can be directly integrated into any group-relative RLVR algorithm such as GRPO, DAPO, and CISPO. On Qwen2.5-7B across in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, our method improves pass@256 from 64.1 $\rightarrow$ 70.3 (GRPO), 69.3 $\rightarrow$ 72.5 (DAPO), and 73.2 $\rightarrow$ 76.8 (CISPO), while preserving or improving pass@1, without increasing group size or computational cost.

Conclusion: 高可塑性（低平滑性）是Transformer迁移学习中的关键特性，为组件选择提供新指导，颠覆了平滑性越优的传统观点。

Abstract: The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers.

Conclusion: 对于多智能体问题，合理的归纳偏置比数据量或参数规模更重要。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a representative multi-agent coordination problem, where multiple agents are required to navigate to their respective goals without collisions. Solving MAPF optimally is known to be NP-hard, leading to the adoption of learning-based approaches to alleviate the online computational burden. Prevailing approaches, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), are typically constrained to pairwise message passing between agents. However, this limitation leads to suboptimal behaviours and critical issues, such as attention dilution, particularly in dense environments where group (i.e. beyond just two agents) coordination is most critical. Despite the importance of such higher-order interactions, existing approaches have not been able to fully explore them. To address this representational bottleneck, we introduce HMAGAT (Hypergraph Multi-Agent Attention Network), a novel architecture that leverages attentional mechanisms over directed hypergraphs to explicitly capture group dynamics. Empirically, HMAGAT establishes a new state-of-the-art among learning-based MAPF solvers: e.g., despite having just 1M parameters and being trained on 100$\times$ less data, it outperforms the current SoTA 85M parameter model. Through detailed analysis of HMAGAT's attention values, we demonstrate how hypergraph representations mitigate the attention dilution inherent in GNNs and capture complex interactions where pairwise methods fail. Our results illustrate that appropriate inductive biases are often more critical than the training data size or sheer parameter count for multi-agent problems.

Conclusion: 该框架为KAN网络提供了高效、可保证的性质验证新范式，兼顾准确性与可扩展性

Abstract: We present a novel approach for verifying properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a class of neural networks characterized by nonlinear, univariate activation functions typically implemented as piecewise polynomial splines or Gaussian processes. Our method creates mathematical ``abstractions'' by replacing each KAN unit with a piecewise affine (PWA) function, providing both local and global error estimates between the original network and its approximation. These abstractions enable property verification by encoding the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), determining whether outputs satisfy specified properties when inputs belong to a given set. A critical challenge lies in balancing the number of pieces in the PWA approximation: too many pieces add binary variables that make verification computationally intractable, while too few pieces create excessive error margins that yield uninformative bounds. Our key contribution is a systematic framework that exploits KAN structure to find optimal abstractions. By combining dynamic programming at the unit level with a knapsack optimization across the network, we minimize the total number of pieces while guaranteeing specified error bounds. This approach determines the optimal approximation strategy for each unit while maintaining overall accuracy requirements. Empirical evaluation across multiple KAN benchmarks demonstrates that the upfront analysis costs of our method are justified by superior verification results.

Abstract: Learning interpretable representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is a major goal of representation learning. The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.

Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) have facilitated the extraction of diverse behaviors from unlabeled, offline data sources. In particular, forward-backward algorithms (FB) can retrieve a family of policies that can approximately solve any standard RL problem (with additive rewards, linear in the occupancy measure), given sufficient capacity. While retaining zero-shot properties, we tackle the greater problem class of RL with general utilities, in which the objective is an arbitrary differentiable function of the occupancy measure. This setting is strictly more expressive, capturing tasks such as distribution matching or pure exploration, which may not be reduced to additive rewards. We show that this additional complexity can be captured by a novel, maximum entropy (soft) variant of the forward-backward algorithm, which recovers a family of stochastic policies from offline data. When coupled with zero-order search over compact policy embeddings, this algorithm can sidestep iterative optimization schemes, and optimizes general utilities directly at test-time. Across both didactic and high-dimensional experiments, we demonstrate that our method retains favorable properties of FB algorithms, while also extending their range to more general RL problems.

Conclusion: AEGIS实现了概念擦除中鲁棒性与保留性的协同优化，突破了现有方法的权衡瓶颈

Abstract: Concept erasure helps stop diffusion models (DMs) from generating harmful content; but current methods face robustness retention trade off. Robustness means the model fine-tuned by concept erasure methods resists reactivation of erased concepts, even under semantically related prompts. Retention means unrelated concepts are preserved so the model's overall utility stays intact. Both are critical for concept erasure in practice, yet addressing them simultaneously is challenging, as existing works typically improve one factor while sacrificing the other. Prior work typically strengthens one while degrading the other, e.g., mapping a single erased prompt to a fixed safe target leaves class level remnants exploitable by prompt attacks, whereas retention-oriented schemes underperform against adaptive adversaries. This paper introduces Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that advances both robustness and retention.

Abstract: Data augmentation can mitigate limited training data in machine-learning automated scoring engines for constructed response items. This study seeks to determine how well three approaches to large language model prompting produce essays that preserve the writing quality of the original essays and produce realistic text for augmenting ASE training datasets. We created simulated versions of student essays, and human raters assigned scores to them and rated the realism of the generated text. The results of the study indicate that the predict next prompting strategy produces the highest level of agreement between human raters regarding simulated essay scores, predict next and sentence strategies best preserve the rated quality of the original essay in the simulated essays, and predict next and 25 examples strategies produce the most realistic text as judged by human raters.

Abstract: Multicalibration gradient boosting has recently emerged as a scalable method that empirically produces approximately multicalibrated predictors and has been deployed at web scale. Despite this empirical success, its convergence properties are not well understood. In this paper, we bridge the gap by providing convergence guarantees for multicalibration gradient boosting in regression with squared-error loss. We show that the magnitude of successive prediction updates decays at $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which implies the same convergence rate bound for the multicalibration error over rounds. Under additional smoothness assumptions on the weak learners, this rate improves to linear convergence. We further analyze adaptive variants, showing local quadratic convergence of the training loss, and we study rescaling schemes that preserve convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets support our theory and clarify the regimes in which the method achieves fast convergence and strong multicalibration.

Motivation: 现有鲁棒PAC学习假设数据与标签是固定的，但实际中可能被对抗选择，需重新建模为在线学习问题。

Method: 定义新维度（类似Littlestone维度）来控制实可实现下的错误界与非实可实现下的后悔界，并推广至多类假设类。

Result: 新维度有效刻画了学习边界，且在未知扰动集但有先验的情况下仍具分析价值。

Conclusion: 该框架为对抗性数据环境下的鲁棒学习提供了新理论工具，扩展了传统PAC学习的适用范围。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning robust classifiers where the classifier will receive a perturbed input. Unlike robust PAC learning studied in prior work, here the clean data and its label are also adversarially chosen. We formulate this setting as an online learning problem and consider both the realizable and agnostic learnability of hypothesis classes. We define a new dimension of classes and show it controls the mistake bounds in the realizable setting and the regret bounds in the agnostic setting. In contrast to the dimension that characterizes learnability in the PAC setting, our dimension is rather simple and resembles the Littlestone dimension. We generalize our dimension to multiclass hypothesis classes and prove similar results in the realizable case. Finally, we study the case where the learner does not know the set of allowed perturbations for each point and only has some prior on them.

Result: 理论证明两种新架构均超越标准超图Weisfeiler-Lehman测试的表达力，实验验证其有效性

Conclusion: 范畴论提供统一视角，可系统推导出表达力更强的超图神经网络架构

Abstract: While lifting map has significantly enhanced the expressivity of graph neural networks, extending this paradigm to hypergraphs remains fragmented. To address this, we introduce the categorical Weisfeiler-Lehman framework, which formalizes lifting as a functorial mapping from an arbitrary data category to the unifying category of graded posets. When applied to hypergraphs, this perspective allows us to systematically derive Hypergraph Isomorphism Networks, a family of neural architectures where the message passing topology is strictly determined by the choice of functor. We introduce two distinct functors from the category of hypergraphs: an incidence functor and a symmetric simplicial complex functor. While the incidence architecture structurally mirrors standard bipartite schemes, our functorial derivation enforces a richer information flow over the resulting poset, capturing complex intersection geometries often missed by existing methods. We theoretically characterize the expressivity of these models, proving that both the incidence-based and symmetric simplicial approaches subsume the expressive power of the standard Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks validate these theoretical findings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出DPO-inducing和displacement-resistant两个新条件，推广了DPO的理论框架，并由此设计出新的SquaredPO损失函数，理论上更强且实践表现相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO方法依赖KL散度和凸函数f，但其凸性并非必需，且存在概率位移问题，需更一般化的理论框架。

Method: 提出DPO-inducing条件以替代凸性，确保问题可解；提出displacement-resistant条件防止概率趋近零；基于此设计新颖的SquaredPO损失函数。

Result: 确定了更广义的可解条件，避免了概率位移，并成功构造出SquaredPO损失，理论保证更强。

Conclusion: SquaredPO在保持DPO优势的同时，具备更强的理论保障，为RLHF优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: DPO and related algorithms align language models by directly optimizing the RLHF objective: find a policy that maximizes the Bradley-Terry reward while staying close to a reference policy through a KL divergence penalty. Previous work showed that this approach could be further generalized: the original problem remains tractable even if the KL divergence is replaced by a family of $f$-divergence with a convex generating function $f$. Our first contribution is to show that convexity of $f$ is not essential. Instead, we identify a more general condition, referred to as DPO-inducing, that precisely characterizes when the RLHF problem remains tractable. Our next contribution is to establish a second condition on $f$ that is necessary to prevent probability displacement, a known empirical phenomenon in which the probabilities of the winner and the loser responses approach zero. We refer to any $f$ that satisfies this condition as displacement-resistant. We finally focus on a specific DPO-inducing and displacement-resistant $f$, leading to our novel SquaredPO loss. Compared to DPO, this new loss offers stronger theoretical guarantees while performing competitively in practice.

Abstract: Being probabilistic models, during inference large language models (LLMs) display rare events: behaviour that is far from typical but highly significant. By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.

Result: 在观测率从3.9%降至0.1%时表现优于强基线，对观测噪声鲁棒，长时序循环同化稳定。

Conclusion: FlowDA为数据驱动的数据同化提供了高效且可扩展的新方向。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a fundamental component of modern weather prediction, yet it remains a major computational bottleneck in machine learning (ML)-based forecasting pipelines due to reliance on traditional variational methods. Recent generative ML-based DA methods offer a promising alternative but typically require many sampling steps and suffer from error accumulation under long-horizon auto-regressive rollouts with cycling assimilation. We propose FlowDA, a low-latency weather-scale generative DA framework based on flow matching. FlowDA conditions on observations through a SetConv-based embedding and fine-tunes the Aurora foundation model to deliver accurate, efficient, and robust analyses. Experiments across observation rates decreasing from $3.9\%$ to $0.1\%$ demonstrate superior performance of FlowDA over strong baselines with similar tunable-parameter size. FlowDA further shows robustness to observational noise and stable performance in long-horizon auto-regressive cycling DA. Overall, FlowDA points to an efficient and scalable direction for data-driven DA.

Method: 将引导形式化为对内部表征的干预，证明其在现实条件下存在大量行为不可区分的等价类，并通过实验验证正交扰动效果相近。

Result: 在无结构假设下，引导向量不可识别；但引入统计独立、稀疏性、多环境验证或跨层一致性等假设后，可恢复可识别性。

Conclusion: 揭示了模型解释性的根本限制，并明确了实现安全关键控制所需的结构假设。

Abstract: Activation steering methods, such as persona vectors, are widely used to control large language model behavior and increasingly interpreted as revealing meaningful internal representations. This interpretation implicitly assumes steering directions are identifiable and uniquely recoverable from input-output behavior. We formalize steering as an intervention on internal representations and prove that, under realistic modeling and data conditions, steering vectors are fundamentally non-identifiable due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions. Empirically, we validate this across multiple models and semantic traits, showing orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes. However, identifiability is recoverable under structural assumptions including statistical independence, sparsity constraints, multi-environment validation or cross-layer consistency. These findings reveal fundamental interpretability limits and clarify structural assumptions required for reliable safety-critical control.

Conclusion: CTAD通过理论保证和实验验证，实现了跨数据集、跨方法的稳定性能提升，是表异常检测的通用增强工具。

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection (TAD) remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of tabular data: features lack natural relationships, vary widely in distribution and scale, and exhibit diverse types. Consequently, each TAD method makes implicit assumptions about anomaly patterns that work well on some datasets but fail on others, and no method consistently outperforms across diverse scenarios. We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection. We prove that OT distance has a lower bound proportional to the test sample's distance from centroids, and establish that anomalies systematically receive higher calibration scores than normals in expectation, explaining why the method generalizes across datasets. Extensive experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors spanning all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, and isolation-based methods) demonstrate that CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance. Remarkably, CTAD enhances even state-of-the-art deep learning methods and shows robust performance across diverse hyperparameter settings, requiring no additional tuning for practical deployment.

Abstract: Hybrid modeling, the combination of machine learning models and scientific mathematical models, enables flexible and robust data-driven prediction with partial interpretability. However, effectively the scientific models may be ignored in prediction due to the flexibility of the machine learning model, making the idea of hybrid modeling pointless. Typically some regularization is applied to hybrid model learning to avoid such a failure case, but the formulation of the regularizer strongly depends on model architectures and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to focus on the flatness of loss minima in learning hybrid models, aiming to make the model as simple as possible. We employ the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and adapt it to the hybrid modeling setting. Numerical experiments show that the SAM-based method works well across different choices of models and datasets.

Conclusion: 熵产率是理解离散扩散逆过程的有效工具，基于物理启发的调度策略可显著提升生成模型效率与性能。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling on sequence data; however, the information-theoretic principles governing their reverse processes remain significantly less understood than those of their continuous counterparts. In this work, we bridge this gap by analyzing the reverse process dynamics through the lens of thermodynamic entropy production. We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed schedules significantly outperform state-of-the-art strategies across diverse application domains, including synthetic data, music notation, vision and language modeling, consistently achieving superior performance at a lower computational budget.

Conclusion: RoBoS-NN损失函数显著提升模型鲁棒性与预测精度，尤其适用于含异常值的复杂数据场景

Abstract: The loss function is crucial to machine learning, especially in supervised learning frameworks. It is a fundamental component that controls the behavior and general efficacy of learning algorithms. However, despite their widespread use, traditional loss functions have significant drawbacks when dealing with high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, which frequently results in reduced performance and slower convergence during training. In this work, we develop a robust, bounded, and smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function to resolve the aforementioned hindrances. The generalization ability of the loss function has also been theoretically analyzed to rigorously justify its robustness. Moreover, we implement RoboS-NN loss in the framework of a neural network (NN) to forecast time series and present a new robust algorithm named $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN. To assess the potential of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets. In addition, we infuse outliers into data sets to evaluate the performance of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN in more challenging scenarios. Numerical results show that $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN outperforms the other benchmark models in terms of accuracy measures.

Conclusion: 几何特性对异常可检测性至关重要，多曲率空间建模可有效提升零样本图异常检测的泛化能力

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify irregular patterns in graph data, and recent works have explored zero-shot generalist GAD to enable generalization to unseen graph datasets. However, existing zero-shot GAD methods largely ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, substantially limiting their cross-domain generalization. In this work, we reveal that anomaly detectability is highly dependent on the underlying geometric properties and that embedding graphs from different domains into a single static curvature space can distort the structural signatures of anomalies. To address the challenge that a single curvature space cannot capture geometry-dependent graph anomaly patterns, we propose GAD-MoRE, a novel framework for zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with a Mixture of Riemannian Experts architecture. Specifically, to ensure that each anomaly pattern is modeled in the Riemannian space where it is most detectable, GAD-MoRE employs a set of specialized Riemannian expert networks, each operating in a distinct curvature space. To align raw node features with curvature-specific anomaly characteristics, we introduce an anomaly-aware multi-curvature feature alignment module that projects inputs into parallel Riemannian spaces, enabling the capture of diverse geometric characteristics. Finally, to facilitate better generalization beyond seen patterns, we design a memory-based dynamic router that adaptively assigns each input to the most compatible expert based on historical reconstruction performance on similar anomalies. Extensive experiments in the zero-shot setting demonstrate that GAD-MoRE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generalist GAD baselines, and even surpasses strong competitors that are few-shot fine-tuned with labeled data from the target domain.

Conclusion: T-STAR可为共享微出行提供高精度、不确定性感知的短时需求预测，支持多模式出行规划与实时运营优化。

Abstract: Reliable short-term demand forecasting is essential for managing shared micro-mobility services and ensuring responsive, user-centered operations. This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining. These results underscore the framework's potential to deliver granular, reliable, and uncertainty-aware short-term demand forecasts, which enable seamless integration to support multimodal trip planning for travelers and enhance real-time operations in shared micro-mobility services.

Motivation: 现有自适应方法如Adam在向量空间有效，但难以直接推广到矩阵谱优化，因实现困难且无法简单迁移Adam的适应机制。

Method: 重构AdaGrad更新，将其分解为方差适应项与尺度不变项，提出DeVA框架，实现从Adam到谱自适应下降的无缝过渡。

Conclusion: DeVA为向量与矩阵优化架起桥梁，兼具实用性与理论优势，是下一代自适应优化器的有力候选。

Abstract: Adaptive methods like Adam have become the $\textit{de facto}$ standard for large-scale vector and Euclidean optimization due to their coordinate-wise adaptation with a second-order nature. More recently, matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024b) show the power of treating weight matrices as matrices rather than long vectors. Linking these is hard because many natural generalizations are not feasible to implement, and we also cannot simply move the Adam adaptation to the matrix spectrum. To address this, we reformulate the AdaGrad update and decompose it into a variance adaptation term and a scale-invariant term. This decoupling produces $\textbf{DeVA}$ ($\textbf{De}$coupled $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{A}$daptation), a framework that bridges between vector-based variance adaptation and matrix spectral optimization, enabling a seamless transition from Adam to adaptive spectral descent. Extensive experiments across language modeling and image classification demonstrate that DeVA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Muon and SOAP (Vyas et al., 2024), reducing token usage by around 6.6\%. Theoretically, we show that the variance adaptation term effectively improves the blockwise smoothness, facilitating faster convergence.

Result: 模型能精准预测全周期力学行为，生成与FEA一致的压容环，且减少对FEA数据的依赖。

Conclusion: CardioGraphFENet实现了高效、高精度的全周期心肌力学仿真，为临床干预规划提供实用工具。

Abstract: Image-based patient-specific simulation of left ventricular (LV) mechanics is valuable for understanding cardiac function and supporting clinical intervention planning, but conventional finite-element analysis (FEA) is computationally intensive. Current graph-based surrogates do not have full-cycle prediction capabilities, and physics-informed neural networks often struggle to converge on complex cardiac geometries. We present CardioGraphFENet (CGFENet), a unified graph-based surrogate for rapid full-cycle estimation of LV myocardial biomechanics, supervised by a large FEA simulation dataset. The proposed model integrates (i) a global--local graph encoder to capture mesh features with weak-form-inspired global coupling, (ii) a gated recurrent unit-based temporal encoder conditioned on the target volume-time signal to model cycle-coherent dynamics, and (iii) a cycle-consistent bidirectional formulation for both loading and inverse unloading within a single framework. These strategies enable high fidelity with respect to traditional FEA ground truths and produce physiologically plausible pressure-volume loops that match FEA results when coupled with a lumped-parameter model. In particular, the cycle-consistency strategy enables a significant reduction in FEA supervision with only minimal loss in accuracy.

Abstract: Recovering a unique causal graph from observational data is an ill-posed problem because multiple generating mechanisms can lead to the same observational distribution. This problem becomes solvable only by exploiting specific structural or distributional assumptions. While recent work has separately utilized time-series dynamics or multi-environment heterogeneity to constrain this problem, we integrate both as complementary sources of heterogeneity. This integration yields unified necessary identifiability conditions and enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical limits of recovery under thin versus heavy-tailed noise. In particular, temporal structure is shown to effectively substitute for missing environmental diversity, possibly achieving identifiability even under insufficient heterogeneity. Extending this analysis to heavy-tailed (Student's t) distributions, we demonstrate that while geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant, the sample complexity diverges significantly from the Gaussian baseline. Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify this cost of robustness, establishing the fundamental limits of covariance-based causal graph recovery methods in realistic non-stationary systems. This work shifts the focus from whether causal structure is identifiable to whether it is statistically recoverable in practice.

Result: 在标准BOED基准上，新方法性能匹配或超越现有最先进方法达22%

Conclusion: SBI与BOED的深度融合显著提升实验设计效率，优化策略是关键突破点

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) seeks to maximize the expected information gain (EIG) of experiments. This requires a likelihood estimate, which in many settings is intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) provides powerful tools for this regime. However, existing work explicitly connecting SBI and BOED is restricted to a single contrastive EIG bound. We show that the EIG admits multiple formulations which can directly leverage modern SBI density estimators, encompassing neural posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation. Building on this perspective, we define a novel EIG estimator using neural likelihood estimation. Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance. With these innovations, our SBI-based BOED methods are able to match or outperform by up to $22\%$ existing state-of-the-art approaches across standard BOED benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的在线凸优化算法，首次实现带时变移动成本的比较器自适应动态遗憾界，并应用于延迟反馈和时变记忆场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准在线凸优化中的移动成本系数通常为常数，但实际场景中可能时变，亟需更通用的理论框架。

Method: 设计一种新算法，通过时变移动成本 $λ_t$ 建立 $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\sum_t λ_t)})$ 的动态遗憾界。

Result: 首次实现比较器自适应的动态遗憾界，且在 $λ_t=0$ 时退化为最优静态/动态 regret，适用于延迟反馈与时间变化记忆问题。

Conclusion: 第一阶移动成本依赖是实现最优自适应 regret 的关键，所提方法为延迟反馈提供了新还原框架，具有独立理论价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we study dynamic regret in unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO) with movement costs. Specifically, we generalize the standard setting by allowing the movement cost coefficients $λ_t$ to vary arbitrarily over time. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm that establishes the first comparator-adaptive dynamic regret bound for this setting, guaranteeing $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\sum_t λ_t)})$ regret, where $P_T$ is the path length of the comparator sequence over $T$ rounds. This recovers the optimal guarantees for both static and dynamic regret in standard OCO as a special case where $λ_t=0$ for all rounds. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we consider two applications: OCO with delayed feedback and OCO with time-varying memory. We show that both problems can be translated into time-varying movement costs, establishing a novel reduction specifically for the delayed feedback setting that is of independent interest. A crucial observation is that the first-order dependence on movement costs in our regret bound plays a key role in enabling optimal comparator-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees in both settings.

Motivation: 传统TMS采用一刀切方式，忽视个体差异；现有EEG-TMS依赖人工预设相位，需改进为用户独立的自适应方法。

Method: 对25名受试者应用EEG-TMS刺激补充运动区-初级运动皮层网络，采用强化学习算法自动识别与高低皮层脊髓兴奋性相关的mu节律相位，并用线性混合效应模型和贝叶斯分析评估运动诱发电位和功能连接变化。

Result: 强化学习成功识别出高低兴奋性对应的mu相位，重复刺激导致目标网络功能连接长期增强或减弱。

Conclusion: 首次证明了人类闭环EEG-TMS的可行性，为脑疾病个性化治疗迈出关键一步。

Abstract: Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful tool to investigate neurophysiology of the human brain and treat brain disorders. Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of closed-loop EEG-TMS in humans, a critical step towards individualized treatment of brain disorders.

Abstract: The recent surge in Time Series Foundation Models has rapidly advanced the field, yet the heterogeneous training setups across studies make it difficult to attribute improvements to architectural innovations versus data engineering. In this work, we investigate the potential of a standard patch Transformer, demonstrating that this generic architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance using a straightforward training protocol. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study that covers model scaling, data composition, and training techniques to isolate the essential ingredients for high performance. Our findings identify the key drivers of performance, while confirming that the generic architecture itself demonstrates excellent scalability. By strictly controlling these variables, we provide comprehensive empirical results on model scaling across multiple dimensions. We release our open-source model and detailed findings to establish a transparent, reproducible baseline for future research.

Conclusion: 简单的架构偏差决定AI是曲线拟合器还是物理学家，为自动化科学发现提供了关键路径。

Abstract: Can general-purpose AI architectures go beyond prediction to discover the physical laws governing the universe? True intelligence relies on "world models" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous "AI Physicist" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively "bake in" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.

Conclusion: LEIA是一种高效、无需群体标签的群体鲁棒性提升方法，在多种实际设置下均表现优异。

Abstract: Deep learning models trained to optimize average accuracy often exhibit systematic failures on particular subpopulations. In real world settings, the subpopulations most affected by such disparities are frequently unlabeled or unknown, thereby motivating the development of methods that are performant on sensitive subgroups without being pre-specified. However, existing group-robust methods typically assume prior knowledge of relevant subgroups, using group annotations for training or model selection. We propose Low-rank Error Informed Adaptation (LEIA), a simple two-stage method that improves group robustness by identifying a low-dimensional subspace in the representation space where model errors concentrate. LEIA restricts adaptation to this error-informed subspace via a low-rank adjustment to the classifier logits, directly targeting latent failure modes without modifying the backbone or requiring group labels. Using five real-world datasets, we analyze group robustness under three settings: (1) truly no knowledge of subgroup relevance, (2) partial knowledge of subgroup relevance, and (3) full knowledge of subgroup relevance. Across all settings, LEIA consistently improves worst-group performance while remaining fast, parameter-efficient, and robust to hyperparameter choice.

Conclusion: 椭圆性是关键结构属性，使带函数逼近的马尔可夫扩散过程强化学习难度等同于监督学习。

Abstract: We study off-policy reinforcement learning for controlling continuous-time Markov diffusion processes with discrete-time observations and actions. We consider model-free algorithms with function approximation that learn value and advantage functions directly from data, without unrealistic structural assumptions on the dynamics.
  Leveraging the ellipticity of the diffusions, we establish a new class of Hilbert-space positive definiteness and boundedness properties for the Bellman operators. Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error. These results identify ellipticity as a key structural property that renders reinforcement learning with function approximation for Markov diffusions no harder than supervised learning.

Motivation: 现有推测解码方法将训练与服务分离，导致部署延迟、反馈滞后和领域漂移问题，影响实际加速效果。

Method: 将推测器训练重构为异步强化学习问题，利用在线推理轨迹提供正负反馈，结合SGLang服务器实现热切换更新。

Conclusion: Aurora 通过训练-服务一体化设计，实现了推测解码的实时自适应，为LLM高效推理提供新范式。

Abstract: Speculative decoding can significantly accelerate LLM serving, yet most deployments today disentangle speculator training from serving, treating speculator training as a standalone offline modeling problem. We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.
  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).

Conclusion: 拓扑视角为非马尔可夫RL提供了新理论工具，Hodge分解揭示了Bellman近似的本质局限，启发了具有理论保障的新算法设计。

Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics are commonly found in real-world environments due to long-range dependencies, partial observability, and memory effects. The Bellman equation that is the central pillar of Reinforcement learning (RL) becomes only approximately valid under Non-Markovian. Existing work often focus on practical algorithm designs and offer limited theoretical treatment to address key questions, such as what dynamics are indeed capturable by the Bellman framework and how to inspire new algorithm classes with optimal approximations. In this paper, we present a novel topological viewpoint on temporal-difference (TD) based RL. We show that TD errors can be viewed as 1-cochain in the topological space of state transitions, while Markov dynamics are then interpreted as topological integrability. This novel view enables us to obtain a Hodge-type decomposition of TD errors into an integrable component and a topological residual, through a Bellman-de Rham projection. We further propose HodgeFlow Policy Search (HFPS) by fitting a potential network to minimize the non-integrable projection residual in RL, achieving stability/sensitivity guarantees. In numerical evaluations, HFPS is shown to significantly improve RL performance under non-Markovian.

Conclusion: EOFlows提供灵活、可调的表示压缩框架，优于固定维度方法

Abstract: Learning unsupervised representations that are both semantically meaningful and stable across runs remains a central challenge in modern representation learning. We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics. We combine likelihood-based training with local Jacobian regularization and noise augmentation into a method that scales well to high-dimensional data such as images. Experiments on the CelebA dataset show that our method uncovers a rich set of semantically interpretable features, allowing for high compression and strong denoising.

Conclusion: ESR是模型内在的自校正机制，既可增强鲁棒性，也可能阻碍安全干预，需被理解与可控引导以实现透明AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.

Abstract: Addressing class imbalance is a central challenge in credit card fraud detection, as it directly impacts predictive reliability in real-world financial systems. To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models. These results highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning and data-driven optimization for advancing trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.

Abstract: Existing approaches for analyzing neural network activations, such as PCA and sparse autoencoders, rely on strong structural assumptions. Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity. We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating "meta-models" that learn the distribution of a network's internal states. We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility. In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases. Moreover, the meta-model's neurons increasingly isolate concepts into individual units, with sparse probing scores that scale as loss decreases. These results suggest generative meta-models offer a scalable path toward interpretability without restrictive structural assumptions. Project page: https://generative-latent-prior.github.io.
