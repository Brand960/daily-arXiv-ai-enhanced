The combination of kinematic, geometric and physics constraints underlying this domain results in challenging nonmonotone problem instances which demand breaking each manipulation action into multiple parts to achieve a desired object rearrangement. Prior work tackles such instances by planning prerelocations, temporary object displacements that enable constraint satisfaction, but deciding where to prerelocate remains difficult due to local minima leading to infeasible or high-cost paths. Our key insight is that these minima can be avoided by steering a prerelocation optimization toward low-cost regions informed by Dubins path classification. These optimized prerelocations are integrated into an object traversability graph that encodes kinematic, geometric, and pushing constraints. Searching this graph in a depth-first fashion results in efficient, feasible rearrangement sequences. Across a series of densely cluttered scenarios with up to 13 objects, our framework, ReloPush-BOSS, exhibits consistently highest success rates and shortest pushing paths compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

A Comparative Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables zero-shot recognition of novel categories through vision-language models, achieving strong performance on natural images. However, transferability to aerial imagery remains unexplored. We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck.

Using a Research through Design (RtD) methodology, we explore plants as metaphoric inspiration for HRI; we conducted iterative cycles of ideation, prototyping, and reflection to investigate what design primitives emerge from plant metaphors and morphologies, and how these primitives can be combined into expressive robotic forms. We present a suite of speculative, open-source prototypes that help probe plant-inspired presence, temporality, form, and gestures. We deepened our learnings from design and prototyping through prototype-centered workshops that explored people's perceptions and imaginaries of plant-inspired robots.

However, most VQA datasets focus on real-world images or simple diagrammatic analysis, with few focused on interpreting complex scientific charts. Indeed, many VQA datasets that analyze charts do not contain the underlying data behind those charts or assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. In reality, charts are transformations (i.e. analysis, simplification, modification) of data. This distinction introduces a reasoning challenge in VQA that the current datasets do not capture. In this paper, we argue for a dedicated VQA benchmark for scientific charts where there is no 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. To do so, we survey existing VQA datasets and highlight limitations of the current field. We then generate synthetic histogram charts based on ground truth data, and ask both humans and a large reasoning model questions where precise answers depend on access to the underlying data.

To address GNSS limitations and the impracticality of camera-based visual positioning, the work proposes a particle filter based fusion of GNSS and inertial data that incorporates spatial priors from maps, such as impassable buildings and unlikely walking areas, functioning as a probabilistic form of map matching. Inertial localization is provided by the RoNIN machine learning method, and fusion with GNSS is achieved by weighting particles based on their consistency with GNSS estimates and uncertainty. The system was evaluated on six challenging walking routes in downtown San Francisco using three metrics related to sidewalk correctness and localization error. Results show that the fused approach (GNSS+RoNIN+PF) significantly outperforms GNSS only localization on most metrics, while inertial-only localization with particle filtering also surpasses GNSS alone for critical measures such as sidewalk assignment and across street error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408GNSS\u3001\u60ef\u6027\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u76f2\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "GNSS\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u51c6\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u89c6\u969c\u7528\u6237\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u76f8\u673a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528RoNIN\u8fdb\u884c\u60ef\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u878d\u5408GNSS\u4e0e\u60ef\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5730\u56fe\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u5982\u5efa\u7b51\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u8d70\u533a\u57df\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u6027\u5730\u56fe\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e7\u91d1\u5c71\u516d\u6761\u590d\u6742\u8def\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGNSS+RoNIN+PF\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eafGNSS\uff0c\u60ef\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d+\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4ea6\u4f18\u4e8eGNSS\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u60ef\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5730\u56fe\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u89c6\u969c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982 sidewalk \u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff09\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002"}}

We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom.

Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 ($0.64$) fall short of classic geometric baselines ($0.97$) and human performance ($0.92$).

This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error.

Code available at : https://github.com/wiskott-lab/single-vs-hier-recon", "summary": "Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u793a\u9884\u7b97\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u7801\u672c\u574d\u7f29\u540e\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53ef\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42VQ-VAE\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5c42VQ-VAE\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u56e0\u5206\u89e3\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ad8\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f4e\u5c42\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u771f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u72ec\u7acb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5339\u914d\u8868\u793a\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u4e0e\u53cc\u5c42VQ-VAE\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ImageNet\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u7f6e\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u8c03\u4f18\u7f13\u89e3\u7801\u672c\u574d\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u5e72\u9884\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u7801\u672c\u574d\u7f29\u540e\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u975e\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u7b49\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a principled framework for strategic interaction, its direct application to humanoid control is hindered by high-dimensional contact dynamics and the absence of strong physical motion priors. We propose RoboStriker, a hierarchical three-stage framework that enables fully autonomous humanoid boxing by decoupling high-level strategic reasoning from low-level physical execution. The framework first learns a comprehensive repertoire of boxing skills by training a single-agent motion tracker on human motion capture data. These skills are subsequently distilled into a structured latent manifold, regularized by projecting the Gaussian-parameterized distribution onto a unit hypersphere. This topological constraint effectively confines exploration to the subspace of physically plausible motions.

Accordingly, we propose VMonarch, a novel attention mechanism for Video DiTs that enables efficient computation over the dynamic sparse patterns with structured Monarch matrices.

To improve efficiency, we train the value network directly in the latent space, avoiding repeated solver calls during policy optimization.

Traditional classical planners, while effective under perfect perception assumptions, are often sensitive to real-world perception constraints and rely on online search procedures that incur high computational costs. In complex surroundings, this renders real-time deployment prohibitive. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for real-time path planning in parking scenarios. In particular, we focus on challenging scenes with tight spaces that require a high number of reversal maneuvers and adjustments. Unlike classical planners, our solution does not require ideal and structured perception, and in principle, could avoid the need for additional modules such as localization and tracking, resulting in a simpler and more practical implementation. Also, at test time, the policy generates actions through a single forward pass at each step, which is lightweight enough for real-time deployment. The task is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem grounded in a bicycle model dynamics, enabling the agent to directly learn navigation policies that respect vehicle kinematics and environmental constraints in the closed-loop setting. A new benchmark is developed to support both training and evaluation, capturing diverse and challenging scenarios. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art success rates and efficiency, surpassing classical planner baselines by +96% in success rate and +52% in efficiency.

We present C2R (Coarse-to-Real), a generative rendering framework that synthesizes real-style urban crowd videos from coarse 3D simulations. Our approach uses coarse 3D renderings to explicitly control scene layout, camera motion, and human trajectories, while a learned neural renderer generates realistic appearance, lighting, and fine-scale dynamics guided by text prompts. To overcome the lack of paired training data between coarse simulations and real videos, we adopt a two-phase mixed CG-real training strategy that learns a strong generative prior from large-scale real footage and introduces controllability through shared implicit spatio-temporal features across domains. The resulting system supports coarse-to-fine control, generalizes across diverse CG and game inputs, and produces temporally consistent, controllable, and realistic urban scene videos from minimal 3D input.

To achieve this, a virtual fixture method is developed, integrated with a continuous, online ergonomic posture assessment framework. Additionally, to improve coordination between the operator and the SRB, which consists of a robotic arm mounted on a floating base, the position of the floating base is adjusted as needed. Experimental results demonstrate the functionality and efficacy of the ergonomics-driven control framework, including two user studies involving practical loco-manipulation tasks with 14 subjects, comparing the proposed framework with a baseline control framework that does not account for human ergonomics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\u7684SRB\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u975e\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u5b66\u59ff\u6001\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u963b\u529b\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u517b\u6210\u6b63\u786e\u59ff\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SRB\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u91c7\u53d6\u4e0d\u8212\u9002\u59ff\u52bf\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u4f7f\u7528\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u635f\u4f24\uff0c\u9700\u5f15\u5bfc ergonomic \u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u865a\u62df\u56fa\u5b9a\u88c5\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6d6e\u52a8\u57fa\u5ea7\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u963b\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc714\u540d\u88ab\u8bd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u59ff\u52bf\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7528\u6237\u957f\u671f\u5f62\u6210\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u5b66\u4e60\u60ef\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning.

However, the clinical implementation and trust of multi-view markerless motion capture (MMMC) require that, in addition to being accurate, these systems produce reliable confidence intervals to indicate how accurate they are for any individual. Building on our prior work utilizing variational inference to estimate joint angle posterior distributions, this study evaluates the calibration and reliability of a probabilistic MMMC method. We analyzed data from 68 participants across two institutions, validating the model against an instrumented walkway and standard marker-based motion capture. We measured the calibration of the confidence intervals using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The model demonstrated reliable calibration, yielding ECE values generally < 0.1 for both step and stride length and bias-corrected gait kinematics. We observed a median step and stride length error of ~16 mm and ~12 mm respectively, with median bias-corrected kinematic errors ranging from 1.5 to 3.8 degrees across lower extremity joints. Consistent with the calibrated ECE, the magnitude of the model's predicted uncertainty correlated strongly with observed error measures.

We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points.

This paper proposes a sample-efficient robust optimal control approach for the determination of assembly motions, which requires significantly less physics simulation steps during planning through the efficient use of derivative information. To this end, a differentiable physics simulation is constructed that provides second-order analytic derivatives to the numerical solver and allows one to traverse seamlessly from informative derivatives to accurate contact simulation. The solution of the physics simulation problem is made differentiable by using smoothing inspired by interior-point methods applied to both the collision detection as well as the contact resolution problem. We propose a modified variant of an optimization-based formulation of collision detection formulated as a linear program and present an efficient implementation for the nominal evaluation and corresponding first- and second-order derivatives. Moreover, a multi-scenario-based trajectory optimization problem that ensures robustness with respect to sim-to-real mismatches is derived. The capability of the considered formulation is illustrated by results where over 99\\% successful executions are achieved in real-world experiments. Thereby, we carefully investigate the effect of smooth approximations of the contact dynamics and robust modeling on the success rates.

Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods. This result highlights a novel path towards mitigating hallucination by unlocking the inherent potential within LVLMs themselves.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u7c97\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e7b\u89c9\u52a0\u5267\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5019\u9009\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u805a\u5408", "result": "\u5728LLaVA-v1.5-7B\u4e0aCHAIRI\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u534765.6%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398LVLM\u81ea\u8eab\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84"}}

Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities.

We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles. Once the semantic intent of the scribble is discerned, we employ globally generated images to extract local texture details, thereby anchoring local semantics and alleviating ambiguities concerning the target semantic locations. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively leverages the strengths of MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art interactive editing performance for scribble-based texture editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faScribbleSense\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u6d82\u9e26\u5f0f3D\u7eb9\u7406\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u76f4\u89c2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6d82\u9e26\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u56e0\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u6790\u6d82\u9e26\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u4ee5\u951a\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d82\u9e26\u5f0f\u7eb9\u7406\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\u6b67\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "ScribbleSense\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d82\u9e26\u4ea4\u4e92\u57283D\u7eb9\u7406\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u51c6\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift.

Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models.

However, standard imitation learning (IL), which most DP methods rely on for training, often inherits sub-optimality and redundancy from expert demonstrations, thereby necessitating a computationally intensive \"generate-then-filter\" pipeline that relies on auxiliary selectors during inference. To address these challenges, we propose Self-Imitated Diffusion Policy (SIDP), a novel framework that learns improved planning by selectively imitating a set of trajectories sampled from itself. Specifically, SIDP introduces a reward-guided self-imitation mechanism that encourages the policy to consistently produce high-quality trajectories efficiently, rather than outputs of inconsistent quality, thereby reducing reliance on extensive sampling and post-filtering. During training, we employ a reward-driven curriculum learning paradigm to mitigate inefficient data utility, and goal-agnostic exploration for trajectory augmentation to improve planning robustness. Extensive evaluations on a comprehensive simulation benchmark show that SIDP significantly outperforms previous methods, with real-world experiments confirming its effectiveness across multiple robotic platforms.

Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold.

While recent advances in 3D-aware visual representations have shown promise, they still suffer from several key limitations, including reliance on multi-view observations during inference which is impractical in single-view restricted scenarios, incomplete scene modeling that fails to capture holistic and fine-grained geometric structures essential for precise manipulation, and lack of effective policy training strategies to retain and exploit the acquired 3D knowledge. To address these challenges, we present MethodName, a unified representation-policy learning framework for view-generalizable robotic manipulation. MethodName introduces a single-view 3D pretraining paradigm that leverages point cloud reconstruction and feed-forward gaussian splatting under multi-view supervision to learn holistic geometric representations. During policy learning, MethodName performs multi-step distillation to preserve the pretrained geometric understanding and effectively transfer it to manipulation skills.

This restricts the deployment scale and requires near-continuous low-latency communication between the operator and the robot. We present MOSAIC: a scalable autonomy framework for multi-robot scientific exploration using a unified mission abstraction based on Points of Interest (POIs) and multiple layers of autonomy, enabling supervision by a single operator. The framework dynamically allocates exploration and measurement tasks based on each robot's capabilities, leveraging team-level redundancy and specialization to enable continuous operation. We validated the framework in a space-analog field experiment emulating a lunar prospecting scenario, involving a heterogeneous team of five robots and a single operator. Despite the complete failure of one robot during the mission, the team completed 82.3% of assigned tasks at an Autonomy Ratio of 86%, while the operator workload remained at only 78.2%. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables robust, scalable multi-robot scientific exploration with limited operator intervention.

A primary limitation of existing approaches is the intrinsic confounding of speaker-specific talking style and semantic content within facial motions, which prevents the faithful transfer of a speaker's unique persona to arbitrary speech. In this paper, we propose MirrorTalk, a generative framework based on a conditional diffusion model, combined with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) that can distill pure style representations from a brief reference video. To effectively utilize this representation, we further introduce a hierarchical modulation strategy within the diffusion process. This mechanism guides the synthesis by dynamically balancing the contributions of audio and style features across distinct facial regions, ensuring both precise lip-sync accuracy and expressive full-face dynamics.

In this work, we revisit RC through the lens of structured operators and state space modeling to address these limitations, introducing Parallel Echo State Network (ParalESN). ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude.

Nevertheless, the potential of Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models, despite their unified architecture and efficient inference, remains underexplored. In this work, we present DreamVAR, a novel framework for subject-driven image synthesis built upon a VAR model that employs next-scale prediction. Technically, multi-scale features of the reference subject are first extracted by a visual tokenizer. Instead of interleaving these conditional features with target image tokens across scales, our DreamVAR pre-fills the full subject feature sequence prior to predicting target image tokens. This design simplifies autoregressive dependencies and mitigates the train-test discrepancy in multi-scale conditioning scenario within the VAR paradigm.

Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is then performed with a hybrid reward that combines diffuse environmental feedback and targeted IRL rewards. A conditional diffusion model, which acts as a safety supervisor, plans safe paths. It stays in its lane, avoids obstacles, and moves smoothly. Then, a learnable adaptive mask (LAM) improves perception. It shifts visual attention based on vehicle speed and nearby hazards. After FSM-based imitation, the policy is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Training is run in the Webots simulator with a two-stage curriculum. A 96\\% success rate is reached, and collisions are reduced to 0.05 per 1k steps, marking a new benchmark for safe navigation.

While prevailing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning of black-box backbones, we propose that forgery detection capability is already encoded within pre-trained models rather than requiring end-to-end retraining. To elicit this intrinsic capability, we propose the discriminative neural anchors (DNA) framework, which employs a coarse-to-fine excavation mechanism. First, by analyzing feature decoupling and attention distribution shifts, we pinpoint critical intermediate layers where the focus of the model logically transitions from global semantics to local anomalies. Subsequently, we introduce a triadic fusion scoring metric paired with a curvature-truncation strategy to strip away semantic redundancy, precisely isolating the forgery-discriminative units (FDUs) inherently imprinted with sensitivity to forgery traces. Moreover, we introduce HIFI-Gen, a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark built upon the very latest models, to address the lag in existing datasets. Experiments demonstrate that by solely relying on these anchors, DNA achieves superior detection performance even under few-shot conditions. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable robustness across diverse architectures and against unseen generative models, validating that waking up latent neurons is more effective than extensive fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDNA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u9ad8\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u4f2a\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5224\u522b\u795e\u7ecf\u951a\u70b9\uff08DNA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bf9\u4f2a\u9020\u654f\u611f\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u5143\u878d\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u66f2\u7387\u622a\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u53d6\u4f2a\u9020\u5224\u522b\u5355\u5143\uff08FDUs\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56DNA\u951a\u70b9\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5524\u9192\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u4f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6bd4\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unstructured environments. We introduce BRACE (Bayesian Reinforcement Assistance with Context Encoding), a novel framework that fine-tunes Bayesian intent inference and context-adaptive assistance through an architecture enabling end-to-end gradient flow between intent inference and assistance arbitration. Our pipeline conditions collaborative control policies on environmental context and complete goal probability distributions. We provide analysis showing (1) optimal assistance levels should decrease with goal uncertainty and increase with environmental constraint severity, and (2) integrating belief information into policy learning yields a quadratic expected regret advantage over sequential approaches. We validated our algorithm against SOTA methods (IDA, DQN) using a three-part evaluation progressively isolating distinct challenges of end-effector control: (1) core human-interaction dynamics in a 2D human-in-the-loop cursor task, (2) non-linear dynamics of a robotic arm, and (3) integrated manipulation under goal ambiguity and environmental constraints. We demonstrate improvements over SOTA, achieving 6.3% higher success rates and 41% increased path efficiency, and 36.3% success rate and 87% path efficiency improvement over unassisted control. Our results confirmed that integrated optimization is most beneficial in complex, goal-ambiguous scenarios, and is generalizable across robotic domains requiring goal-directed assistance, advancing the SOTA for adaptive shared autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "BRACE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6216\u5206\u79bb\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBRACE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f85\u52a9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4fe1\u606f\u5230\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u9879\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cBRACE\u76f8\u8f83SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08IDA\u3001DQN\uff09\u63d0\u53476.3%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e41%\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u65e0\u8f85\u52a9\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u534736.3%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e87%\u8def\u5f84\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u96c6\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u590d\u6742\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5171\u4eab\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684SOTA\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Computer vision approaches have been applied to BCS prediction, with depth images widely used because they capture geometric information independent of coat color and texture. More recently, three-dimensional point cloud data have attracted increasing interest due to their ability to represent richer geometric characteristics of animal morphology, but direct head-to-head comparisons with depth image-based approaches remain limited. In this study, we compared top-view depth image and point cloud data for BCS prediction under four settings: 1) unsegmented raw data, 2) segmented full-body data, 3) segmented hindquarter data, and 4) handcrafted feature data. Prediction models were evaluated using data from 1,020 dairy cows collected on a commercial farm, with cow-level cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Depth image-based models consistently achieved higher accuracy than point cloud-based models when unsegmented raw data and segmented full-body data were used, whereas comparable performance was observed when segmented hindquarter data were used. Both depth image and point cloud approaches showed reduced accuracy when handcrafted feature data were employed compared with the other settings. Overall, point cloud-based predictions were more sensitive to noise and model architecture than depth image-based predictions. Taken together, these results indicate that three-dimensional point clouds do not provide a consistent advantage over depth images for BCS prediction in dairy cattle under the evaluated conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u5728\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u51b5\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5e76\u672a\u6bd4\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u5206\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u4f53\u51b5\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u4e8c\u8005\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u75281020\u5934\u5976\u725b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u672a\u5206\u5272\u3001\u5168\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u540e\u8eaf\u5206\u5272\u548c\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u56db\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e2a\u4f53\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u672a\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5168\u8eab\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u540e\u8eaf\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u4ecd\u662f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f53\u51b5\u8bc4\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u70b9\u4e91\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Although real-world scenes exhibit strong structure, existing methods treat it as an independent pixel-wise prediction, often resulting in structural inconsistencies.

By bidirectional hierarchical reasoning, segment tokens are hierarchically pooled in the encoder and unpooled in the decoder to reverse the hierarchy. The model is supervised only at the final output, allowing the segment hierarchy to emerge without explicit segmentation supervision. SHED improves depth boundary sharpness and segment coherence, while demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization from synthetic to the real-world environments.

We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity.

However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters.

Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations.

In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality. Future work will investigate the relationship between confidence thresholds and recognition performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528ArUco\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5185\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfOpenCV\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528ArUco\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u52a8\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u8bb0\u7684ID\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bad\u7ec3YOLO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u5931\u7126\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u52b3\u52a8\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6807\u6ce8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u7814\u7a76\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u4e0e\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cbe\u51c6\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u9891\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6839\u6e90\u53ca\u5176\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8d1f\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u8fc7\u523b\u610f\u7834\u574f\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u9891\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce FlowSymm, a novel architecture that combines (i) a group-action on divergence-free flows, (ii) a graph-attention encoder to learn feature-conditioned weights over these symmetry-preserving actions, and (iii) a lightweight Tikhonov refinement solved via implicit bilevel optimization. The method first anchors the given observation on a minimum-norm divergence-free completion. We then compute an orthonormal basis for all admissible group actions that leave the observed flows invariant and parameterize the valid solution subspace, which shows an Abelian group structure under vector addition. A stack of GATv2 layers then encodes the graph and its edge features into per-edge embeddings, which are pooled over the missing edges and produce per-basis attention weights. This attention-guided process selects a set of physics-aware group actions that preserve the observed flows. Finally, a scalar Tikhonov penalty refines the missing entries via a convex least-squares solver, with gradients propagated implicitly through Cholesky factorization.

In daily phone use, mobile assistants must track streaming audio-visual inputs and respond at the right time, yet existing benchmarks are often restricted to multiple-choice questions or use shorter videos. In this paper, we introduce PhoStream, the first mobile-centric streaming benchmark that unifies on-screen and off-screen scenarios to evaluate video, audio, and temporal reasoning. PhoStream contains 5,572 open-ended QA pairs from 578 videos across 4 scenarios and 10 capabilities. We build it with an Automated Generative Pipeline backed by rigorous human verification, and evaluate models using a realistic Online Inference Pipeline and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation for open-ended responses. Experiments reveal a temporal asymmetry in LLM-judged scores (0-100): models perform well on Instant and Backward tasks (Gemini 3 Pro exceeds 80), but drop sharply on Forward tasks (16.40), largely due to early responses before the required visual and audio cues appear. This highlights a fundamental limitation: current MLLMs struggle to decide when to speak, not just what to say.

Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u8def\u7531\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8def\u7531\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u6d89\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u800c\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u5316MLP\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316K-means\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u534f\u4f5c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6210\u672c\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u67e5\u8be2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u964d\u4f4e\u8def\u7531\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3aLLM\u8def\u7531\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Angular misalignments of LiDAR sensors can lead to safety-critical issues during autonomous operation. However, current methods primarily focus on correcting sensor-to-sensor errors without considering the miscalibration of individual sensors that cause these errors in the first place. We introduce FlowCalib, the first framework that detects LiDAR-to-vehicle miscalibration using motion cues from the scene flow of static objects. Our approach leverages the systematic bias induced by rotational misalignment in the flow field generated from sequential 3D point clouds, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The architecture integrates a neural scene flow prior for flow estimation and incorporates a dual-branch detection network that fuses learned global flow features with handcrafted geometric descriptors. These combined representations allow the system to perform two complementary binary classification tasks: a global binary decision indicating whether misalignment is present and separate, axis-specific binary decisions indicating whether each rotational axis is misaligned. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate FlowCalib's ability to robustly detect miscalibration, establishing a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle miscalibration detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowCalib\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4bLiDAR\u4e0e\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4fee\u6b63\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5355\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u52173D\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u8f74\u5411\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86FlowCalib\u5bf9LiDAR-\u8f66\u8f86\u6821\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowCalib\u4e3a\u4f20\u611f\u5668-\u8f66\u8f86\u6821\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin.

Recent graph-based models leverage spatial relationships between Wire-less Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Access Points (APs) and devices, offering finer localization granularity, but fall short in quantifying prediction uncertainty, a key requirement for real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Graph Transformer (SAC-GT), a framework for accurate and reliable indoor localization. SAC-GT integrates a Graph Transformer (GT) model that captures network's spatial topology and signal strength dynamics, with a novel Spatially-Adaptive Conformal Prediction (SACP) method that provides region-specific uncertainty estimates. This allows SAC-GT to produce not only precise two-dimensional (2D) location predictions but also statistically valid confidence regions tailored to varying environmental conditions.

To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks.

In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost.

To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement. Then, to further enhance point cloud feature representation, we propose a dynamic channel gating mechanism that leverages learnable channel-wise weighting.

While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets.

We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.\n  Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.\n  We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.\n  Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters).

Under mild conditions, SIS yields unbiased estimators with strict finite-sample mean squared error (MSE) improvements over both importance sampling (IS) and stratified random sampling (SRS). The framework does not rely on optimally defined proposal distributions or strata: even with noisy proxies and sub-optimal stratification, SIS can improve estimator efficiency compared to IS or SRS individually, though extreme proposal mismatch may limit these gains.

Most existing approaches adopt a discrete pipeline: molecules are encoded as sequences, graphs, or point clouds, mapped to fixed-dimensional embeddings, and then used for task-specific prediction. This paradigm treats molecules as discrete objects, despite their intrinsically continuous and field-like physical nature. We argue that molecular learning can instead be formulated as learning in function space. Specifically, we model each molecule as a continuous function over three-dimensional (3D) space and treat this molecular field as the primary object of representation. From this perspective, conventional molecular representations arise as particular sampling schemes of an underlying continuous object. We instantiate this formulation with MolField, a hyper-network-based framework that learns distributions over molecular fields. To ensure physical consistency, these functions are defined over canonicalized coordinates, yielding invariance to global SE(3) transformations. To enable learning directly over functions, we introduce a structured weight tokenization and train a sequence-based hyper-network to model a shared prior over molecular fields. We evaluate MolField on molecular dynamics and property prediction.

Existing methods achieve this attribution goal by training models using annotated pairs of synthetic images and their original training sources. However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment.

At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$.

Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it. Our method relies on noise regeneration using a pseudorandom noise generator, eliminating the need to store past noise. As a result, it requires no additional memory beyond standard DP-SGD.

Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPBO\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3SNN\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56e0\u4f4e\u901a\u7279\u6027\u5ffd\u89c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "SNN\u867d\u5177\u65f6\u95f4\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8fdc\u900a\u4e8eANN\uff0c\u56e0\u6807\u51c6\u8109\u51b2\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e3a\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8fd0\u52a8\u9891\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPass-Bands Optimizer (PBO)\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u901a\u5e26\u4ee5\u805a\u7126\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728UCF101\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u8d8510\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u663e\u8457\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "PBO\u4e3aSNN\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u5e26\u4f18\u5316\u7a81\u7834\u5f53\u524d\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption.\n  Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes.

Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment.

However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference.

This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs.

By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \\emph{not} be the \\(W_2\\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u8861\u91cf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728FID\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5728Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e8c\u6b21Wasserstein\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9525\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u4e0e\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u65af\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5c55\u9ad8\u6548\u968f\u673a\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5747\u5300\u3001\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u7b49\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e0b\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u6bd4Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u65b0\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f18\u4e8e\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0eFID\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT.

In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples. Experiments on vision benchmarks with deep neural networks demonstrate that residual knowledge is prevalent across existing unlearning methods and that our approach effectively prevents residual knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b8b\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1RURK\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f13\u89e3\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRURK\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc6\u522b\u6270\u52a8\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u6291\u5236\u6b8b\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6b8b\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0cRURK\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u8be5\u98ce\u9669\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6b8b\u4f59\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\uff0cRURK\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4fdd\u969c"}}

Existing benchmarks are typically multilingual but text-only, or multimodal but monolingual. Recent multilingual multimodal red-teaming efforts render harmful prompts into images, yet rely heavily on typography-style visuals and lack semantically grounded image-text pairs, limiting coverage of realistic cross-modal interactions. We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks. This underscores the necessity of language- and modality-aware safety alignment beyond mere scaling.To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release our benchmark, model checkpoints, and source code.The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/zsxr15/Lingua-SafetyBench.Warning: this paper contains examples with unsafe content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLingua-SafetyBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001VLLM\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7f29\u653e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5747\u8861\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5b89\u5168\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5355\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6709\u5bb3\u5bf9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30VLLM\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa100,440\u4e2a\u8de810\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3011\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90VLLM\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a7\u5236Qwen\u7cfb\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u7f29\u653e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00ASR\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u867d\u964d\u4f4e\u603b\u4f53ASR\uff0c\u4f46\u52a0\u5267HRL\u4e0eNon-HRL\u95f4\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "VLLM\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u9700\u8003\u8651\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u53cc\u91cd\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u589e\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \\emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times. We argue that sustainable LLM deployment depends not only on model internals, but also on the orchestration of the serving stack.

StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute.

Existing methods rely mainly on raw structural data and struggle to exploit the rich scientific literature. While large language models (LLMs) have been added to these pipelines, they have been confined to narrow roles within structure-centered optimizers. We instead cast biological black-box optimization as a fully agentic, language-based reasoning process. We introduce Purely Agentic BLack-box Optimization (PABLO), a hierarchical agentic system that uses scientific LLMs pretrained on chemistry and biology literature to generate and iteratively refine biological candidates. On both the standard GuacaMol molecular design and antimicrobial peptide optimization tasks, PABLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving sample efficiency and final objective values over established baselines. Compared to prior optimization methods that incorporate LLMs, PABLO achieves competitive token usage per run despite relying on LLMs throughout the optimization loop. Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints.

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faG-Substrate\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5b64\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b64\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5f8b\u91cd\u590d\u6784\u5efa\u800c\u975e\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u793a\u590d\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faG-Substrate\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4ea4\u9519\u89d2\u8272\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u540c\u4e00\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u517c\u5bb9\u5e76\u627f\u62c5\u4e0d\u540c\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cG-Substrate\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b64\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6734\u7d20\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6301\u4e45\u4e14\u53ef\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We first show these approaches have an inherent fidelity-stability dilemma in how they detect anomalies via reconstruction residuals. We then abandon the reconstruction paradigm entirely and propose Retrieval-based Anomaly Detection (RAD). RAD is a training-free approach that stores anomaly-free features in a memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, matching test patches against the memory. Experiments demonstrate that RAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across four established benchmarks (MVTec-AD, VisA, Real-IAD, 3D-ADAM) under both standard and few-shot settings. On MVTec-AD, RAD reaches 96.7\\% Pixel AUROC with just a single anomaly-free image compared to 98.5\\% of RAD's full-data performance. We further prove that retrieval-based scores theoretically upper-bound reconstruction-residual scores. Collectively, these findings overturn the assumption that MUAD requires task-specific training, showing that state-of-the-art anomaly detection is feasible with memory-based retrieval.

On one hand, multi-date approaches using NeRF or Gaussian-splatting jointly model appearance and geometry across many acquisitions, achieving accurate reconstructions on opportunistic imagery with numerous observations. On the other hand, classical stereoscopic reconstruction pipelines deliver robust and scalable results for simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous image pairs. However, when the two images are captured months apart, strong seasonal, illumination, and shadow changes violate standard stereoscopic assumptions, causing existing pipelines to fail. This work presents the first Diachronic Stereo Matching method for satellite imagery, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction from temporally distant pairs. Two advances make this possible: (1) fine-tuning a state-of-the-art deep stereo network that leverages monocular depth priors, and (2) exposing it to a dataset specifically curated to include a diverse set of diachronic image pairs. In particular, we start from a pretrained MonSter model, trained initially on a mix of synthetic and real datasets such as SceneFlow and KITTI, and fine-tune it on a set of stereo pairs derived from the DFC2019 remote sensing challenge. This dataset contains both synchronic and diachronic pairs under diverse seasonal and illumination conditions. Experiments on multi-date WorldView-3 imagery demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses classical pipelines and unadapted deep stereo models on both synchronic and diachronic settings. Fine-tuning on temporally diverse images, together with monocular priors, proves essential for enabling 3D reconstruction from previously incompatible acquisition dates.

In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\\sqrt{d}/(n\u03b5)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes.

Consequently, their reasoning capability is limited when dealing with complex scenes characterized by ambiguity and visual uncertainty. In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FarmMind achieves superior segmentation performance and stronger generalization ability compared with existing methods.

To address this, we propose native visual tokenization, which enforces causal dependencies during tokenization. Building on this idea, we introduce NativeTok, a framework that achieves efficient reconstruction while embedding relational constraints within token sequences. NativeTok consists of: (1) a Meta Image Transformer (MIT) for latent image modeling, and (2) a Mixture of Causal Expert Transformer (MoCET), where each lightweight expert block generates a single token conditioned on prior tokens and latent features.

Specifically, NCT introduces a semantic-enhanced module to take semantic descriptions of garments and utilizes a visual-language encoder to learn aligned features across modalities. The aligned features are served as condition input to the diffusion model to enhance the preservation of the garment's semantics.

Redundancy and Slimmability in Remote Sensing Foundation Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large-scale foundation models (FMs) in remote sensing (RS) are developed based on the paradigms established in computer vision (CV) and have shown promise for various Earth observation applications. However, the direct transfer of scaling assumptions from CV to RS has not been adequately examined. We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models.

Existing incomplete MDL methods either discard missing modalities, risking the loss of valuable task-relevant information, or recover them, potentially introducing irrelevant noise, leading to the discarding-imputation dilemma. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample. Since direct estimation of such information at test time is intractable due to the unknown data distribution, we theoretically establish a connection between information and the task loss, which we compute at inference time as a tractable proxy. Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on diverse natural and medical image datasets show that DyMo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete/dynamic MDL methods across various missing-data scenarios.

Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.\n  To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images).

As forecasting is probabilistic, developing and evaluating AI forecasters requires generating large numbers of diverse and difficult questions, and accurately resolving them. Previous efforts to automate this laborious work relied on recurring data sources (e.g., weather, stocks), limiting diversity and utility. In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform.

This assumption breaks down in many real-world settings, where the same object or action may be normal or anomalous depending on latent contextual factors (e.g., running on a track versus on a highway). We revisit \\emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance. To enable systematic study of this setting, we introduce CAAD-3K, a benchmark that isolates contextual anomalies by controlling subject identity while varying context. We further propose a conditional compatibility learning framework that leverages vision--language representations to model subject--context relationships under limited supervision. Our method substantially outperforms existing approaches on CAAD-3K and achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA, demonstrating that modeling context dependence complements traditional structural anomaly detection.

Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM.

In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable.

Preprint version; the final camera-ready version may differ", "summary": "Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves strong detection and localization performance, interpretability, and robustness under various levels of data contamination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6c61\u67d3\u4e14\u65e0\u5f02\u5e38\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u5408\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u6570\u3001\u71b5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5206\u6570\u548c\u5206\u5272\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u4f8b\u52a0\u6743\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec\u548cVisA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6297\u6c61\u67d3\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c11\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u6807\u7b7e\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6c61\u67d3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate these properties within the setting of the $k$-parity problem (computing the XOR sum of $k$ relevant bits), where neural networks typically exhibit grokking -- a prolonged plateau of chance-level performance followed by sudden generalization. We theoretically decompose the Masked Diffusion (MD) objective into a Signal regime which drives feature learning, and a Noise regime which serves as an implicit regularizer. By training nanoGPT using MD objective on the $k$-parity problem, we demonstrate that MD objective fundamentally alters the learning landscape, enabling rapid and simultaneous generalization without experiencing grokking. Furthermore, we leverage our theoretical insights to optimize the distribution of the mask probability in the MD objective. Our method significantly improves perplexity for 50M-parameter models and achieves superior results across both pre-training from scratch and supervised fine-tuning.

In practice, acquiring these distances depends on labour-intensive manual interpretation of animal observations across large camera trap video corpora. This study introduces and evaluates an only sparsely explored alternative: the integration of computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) pipelines directly into ecological camera trap workflows for great ape conservation. Using a real-world dataset of 220 camera trap videos documenting a wild chimpanzee population, we combine two MDE models, Dense Prediction Transformers and Depth Anything, with multiple distance sampling strategies. These components are used to generate detection distance estimates, from which population density and abundance are inferred. Comparative analysis against manually derived ground-truth distances shows that calibrated DPT consistently outperforms Depth Anything. This advantage is observed in both distance estimation accuracy and downstream density and abundance inference. Nevertheless, both models exhibit systematic biases. We show that, given complex forest environments, they tend to overestimate detection distances and consequently underestimate density and abundance relative to conventional manual approaches. We further find that failures in animal detection across distance ranges are a primary factor limiting estimation accuracy. Overall, this work provides a case study that shows MDE-driven camera trap distance sampling is a viable and practical alternative to manual distance estimation.

However, prevailing methods are predominantly task-centric and rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as short-term dependency modeling, static neighborhood semantics, and retrospective time usage. These constraints hinder the discovery of transferable temporal evolution mechanisms. To address this, we propose the Temporal Graph Pattern Machine (TGPM), a foundation framework that shifts the focus toward directly learning generalized evolving patterns. TGPM conceptualizes each interaction as an interaction patch synthesized via temporally-biased random walks, thereby capturing multi-scale structural semantics and long-range dependencies that extend beyond immediate neighborhoods. These patches are processed by a Transformer-based backbone designed to capture global temporal regularities while adapting to context-specific interaction dynamics. To further empower the model, we introduce a suite of self-supervised pre-training tasks -- specifically masked token modeling and next-time prediction -- to explicitly encode the fundamental laws of network evolution.

Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence.

In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5373\u4f7f\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u6f0f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSLImE\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u4f4e\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\u5373\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSLImE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u672c\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u4e0e\u73b0\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728GEMINI\u3001COHERE\u3001NOMIC\u3001CLIP\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6062\u590d\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u8fde\u8d2f\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u6f0f\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u6784\u6210\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u5cfb\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Guided by this prior, the second stage, Token-Level Budgeting, allocates tokens in two phases: it first secures high-relevance Core Tokens, followed by diverse Context Tokens selected with an efficient batched Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm.

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics.

This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process.

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was designed to improve reasoning, but in fact it worsens this situation through two failure modes: diversity collapse, where training amplifies a single solution strategy while ignoring alternatives of gradient signal, and gradient diminishing, where a large portion of questions yield zero gradients because all rollouts receive identical rewards. We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift.

Conventional slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods are time-consuming and require multiple orthogonal stacks for reconstruction.

To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes.

In this paper, we propose Elastic Spectral State Space Models (ES-SSM), which require only one-time training at full capacity, but can be directly truncated into arbitrary scales for budgeted, runtime inference without retraining. Our ES-SSM builds on Hankel spectral filtering over a state space model (SSM), coupled with a lightweight input-adaptive gate trained under randomized spectral budgets. Using a shared masked normalization rule over the ordered spectral channels, we encourage predictive capability to concentrate in low-index components, while higher-index components act primarily as refinement. We test our algorithm across long-sequence benchmarks spanning text, logic, retrieval, vision, and audio.

Steering offers a lightweight technique to improve model performance. However, steering, whether input-dependent or input-independent, achieves a meaningful trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we observe that steering vectors can generalize across inputs when tasks share aligned semantic intent. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{OSGA} (\\textbf{O}ne-shot \\textbf{S}teering with \\textbf{G}enerative \\textbf{A}nchor), an input-independent framework that improves model performance with a single optimization instance. OSGA first selects an informative sample via a variance-based data selection strategy and learns a single steering vector with a contrastive objective with generative anchor regularization. The resulting vector can be universally applied at a certain layer during inference time without modifying model parameters.

Submitted to ICML. 8 pages, 5 figures (+ appendix)", "summary": "Fine-tuning flow matching models is a central challenge in settings with limited data, evolving distributions, or strict efficiency demands, where unconstrained fine-tuning can erode the accuracy and efficiency gains learned during pretraining. Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning.

Existing paradigms rely on either large-scale retrieval, which requires storing a large number of image embeddings, grid-based classifiers that ignore geographic continuity, or generative models that diffuse over space but struggle with fine detail. We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the current methods in the literature, it reduces mean geodesic error by 19.5\\%, while improving the fine-grained subregion accuracy by 43%.

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment.

In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift. Extensive experiments show that, under such continual drift, DREE effectively learns new tasks, preserves prior knowledge, improves generalization to unseen tasks, and can be applied to diverse existing neural solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDREE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecfVRP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6301\u7eed\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecfVRP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u5145\u8db3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u6f02\u79fb\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u56de\u653e\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u6f02\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\uff0cDREE\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u7528\u9002\u914d\u591a\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "DREE\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecfVRP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning.

However, related studies on event sensors are scarce or narrowly centered on semantic-level understanding. We introduce SEAL, the first Semantic-aware Segment Any Events framework that addresses Open-Vocabulary Event Instance Segmentation (OV-EIS). Given the visual prompt, our model presents a unified framework to support both event segmentation and open-vocabulary mask classification at multiple levels of granularity, including instance-level and part-level. To enable thorough evaluation on OV-EIS, we curate four benchmarks that cover label granularity from coarse to fine class configurations and semantic granularity from instance-level to part-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our SEAL largely outperforms proposed baselines in terms of performance and inference speed with a parameter-efficient architecture. In the Appendix, we further present a simple variant of our SEAL achieving generic spatiotemporal OV-EIS that does not require any visual prompts from users in the inference.

This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods.

Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data.

This paper introduces Med-Scout, a novel framework that \"cures\" this blindness via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that leverages the intrinsic geometric logic latent within unlabeled medical images. Instead of relying on costly expert annotations, Med-Scout derives verifiable supervision signals through three strategic proxy tasks: Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection. To rigorously quantify this deficit, we present Med-Scout-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate geometric perception. Extensive evaluations show that Med-Scout significantly mitigates geometric blindness, outperforming leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs by over 40% on our benchmark.

Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) evolve distribution parameters and naturally support discrete generation. But classical BFNs typically rely on factorized beliefs and independent channels, which limit geometric evidence fusion. We propose Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN), which performs a variational lifting to a tractable joint Gaussian variational belief family governed by structured precisions.

However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability.

Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \\emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \\textbf{REKD} (\\textbf{R}ationale \\textbf{E}xtraction with \\textbf{K}nowledge \\textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \\emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faREKD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f31\u80fd\u529b\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be", "method": "REKD\uff1a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c", "result": "\u5728IMDB\u3001CIFAR10\u548cCIFAR100\u4e0a\uff0cREKD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "REKD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u4efb\u610f\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b"}}

We introduce Video-o3, a novel framework that supports iterative discovery of salient visual clues, fine-grained inspection of key segments, and adaptive termination once sufficient evidence is acquired. Technically, we address two core challenges in interleaved tool invocation. First, to mitigate attention dispersion induced by the heterogeneity of reasoning and tool-calling, we propose Task-Decoupled Attention Masking, which isolates per-step concentration while preserving shared global context. Second, to control context length growth in multi-turn interactions, we introduce a Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward that balances exploration coverage with reasoning efficiency. To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes.

Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5404\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u9886\u57df\u8bba\u6587\u6fc0\u589e\u4f46\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5398\u6e05\u54ea\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u771f\u6b63\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa minimalist \u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5355 rollout\u3001\u65e0\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u3001batch size=32\uff09\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u5e26\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f18\u52bf\u51fd\u6570\u3001rollout \u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u82e5\u5e72\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5806\u53e0\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u56e0\u7d20\u8fdc\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u8d44\u6e90\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u53d8\u91cf\u3002"}}

Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges.

In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples).

TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation.

In this work, we present conserved quantity correction, a model-agnostic technique for incorporation physical conservation criteria within deep learning models.

While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence.

Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge.

Traditional bot mitigation techniques, including IP blacklists and CAPTCHA-based challenges, are increasingly ineffective or intrusive, as modern bots leverage proxies, botnets, and AI-assisted evasion strategies. This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs.

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead.

We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries.

To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLethe\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u4e45\u9057\u5fd8", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ee7\u7eed\u65f6\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u80fd\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9057\u5fd8\u5931\u6548", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Reshape--Rectify--Restore\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u653e\u5927\u68af\u5ea6\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u4fdd\u7559\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "Lethe\u5728\u591a\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u73b0\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e1%", "conclusion": "Lethe\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6301\u4e45\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9057\u5fd8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027"}}

Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization.

However, standard approaches typically rely on single-model confidence thresholds, which are frequently unreliable due to inherent calibration issues. To address this, we introduce SQUAD (Scalable Quorum Adaptive Decisions), the first inference scheme that integrates early-exit mechanisms with distributed ensemble learning, improving uncertainty estimation while reducing the inference time. Unlike traditional methods that depend on individual confidence scores, SQUAD employs a quorum-based stopping criterion on early-exit learners by collecting intermediate predictions incrementally in order of computational complexity until a consensus is reached and halting the computation at that exit if the consensus is statistically significant. To maximize the efficacy of this voting mechanism, we also introduce QUEST (Quorum Search Technique), a Neural Architecture Search method to select early-exit learners with optimized hierarchical diversity, ensuring learners are complementary at every intermediate layer. This consensus-driven approach yields statistically robust early exits, improving the test accuracy up to 5.95% compared to state-of-the-art dynamic solutions with a comparable computational cost and reducing the inference latency up to 70.60% compared to static ensembles while maintaining a good accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "SQUAD\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u8bc6\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u56e0\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "SQUAD\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6b65\u6536\u96c6\u4e2d\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5171\u8bc6\u6295\u7968\u51b3\u5b9a\u63d0\u524d\u9000\u51fa\uff1bQUEST\u7528\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u5177\u6709\u5c42\u6b21\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u53475.95%\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e70.60%\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5171\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9000\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

However, existing methods struggle with difficult reasoning problems for two reasons: raw test questions are often too difficult to yield high-quality pseudo-labels, and the limited size of test sets makes continuous online updates prone to instability. To address these limitations, we propose TTCS, a co-evolving test-time training framework. Specifically, TTCS initializes two policies from the same pretrained model: a question synthesizer and a reasoning solver. These policies evolve through iterative optimization: the synthesizer generates progressively challenging question variants conditioned on the test questions, creating a structured curriculum tailored to the solver's current capability, while the solver updates itself using self-consistency rewards computed from multiple sampled responses on both original test and synthetic questions. Crucially, the solver's feedback guides the synthesizer to generate questions aligned with the model's current capability, and the generated question variants in turn stabilize the solver's test-time training. Experiments show that TTCS consistently strengthens the reasoning ability on challenging mathematical benchmarks and transfers to general-domain tasks across different LLM backbones, highlighting a scalable path towards dynamically constructing test-time curricula for self-evolving.

Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization.

Mainstream solutions such as domain adaptation and meta-learning still rely on large amounts of historical degradation data from equipment that is identical or similar to the target, which imposes significant limitations in practical applications. This study investigates PEFT-MuTS, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, built on cross-domain pre-trained time-series representation models. Contrary to the widely held view that knowledge transfer in RUL prediction can only occur within similar devices, we demonstrate that substantial benefits can be achieved through pre-training process with large-scale cross-domain time series datasets. A independent feature tuning network and a meta-variable-based low rank multivariate fusion mechanism are developed to enable the pre-trained univariate time-series representation backbone model to fully exploit the multivariate relationships in degradation data for downstream RUL prediction task. Additionally, we introduce a zero-initialized regressor that stabilizes the fine-tuning process under few-shot conditions. Experiments on aero-engine and industrial bearing datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve effective RUL prediction even when less than 1\\% of samples of target equipment are used.

However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection.

Distinguished from previous neuro-symbolic methods limited by passive post-hoc validation, our approach actively penalizes intermediate fallacies during the reasoning chain. We operationalize this framework via a novel two-stage training pipeline that synergizes formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization. Extensive evaluation on six benchmarks spanning mathematical, logical, and general reasoning demonstrates that our 7B and 14B models outperform state-of-the-art baselines by average margins of 10.4% and 14.2%, respectively.

While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual.

A core challenge in comparing these two GNN training approaches lies in characterizing their model performance (i.e., convergence and generalization) and computational efficiency. While a batch size has been an effective lens in analyzing such behaviors in deep neural networks (DNNs), GNNs extend this lens by introducing a fan-out size, as full-graph training can be viewed as mini-batch training with the largest possible batch size and fan-out size. However, the impact of the batch and fan-out size for GNNs remains insufficiently explored. To this end, this paper systematically compares full-graph vs. mini-batch training of GNNs through empirical and theoretical analyses from the view points of the batch size and fan-out size. Our key contributions include: 1) We provide a novel generalization analysis using the Wasserstein distance to study the impact of the graph structure, especially the fan-out size. 2) We uncover the non-isotropic effects of the batch size and the fan-out size in GNN convergence and generalization, providing practical guidance for tuning these hyperparameters under resource constraints. Finally, full-graph training does not always yield better model performance or computational efficiency than well-tuned smaller mini-batch settings.

However, current models still exhibit substantial limitations in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared with humans. We investigate this gap through periodicity, one of the basic OOD scenarios. Periodicity captures invariance amid variation. Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity.

Acceptance and effective adoption by clinicians and patients, as well as regulatory approval, require evidence of trustworthiness. A major factor for the development of trustworthy AI is the quantification of data quality for AI model training and testing. We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task. Here, we operationalize this theoretical framework by introducing a collection of data quality metrics - the metric library - for practically measuring data quality dimensions. For each metric, we provide a metric card with the most important information, including definition, applicability, examples, pitfalls and recommendations, to support the understanding and implementation of these metrics. Furthermore, we discuss strategies and provide decision trees for choosing an appropriate set of data quality metrics from the metric library given specific use cases.

Code and live demo available at https://github.com/riteshbhadana/IR-Drop-Predictor", "summary": "IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis.

However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters.

In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLoRDS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5757\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u727a\u7272\u8868\u8fbe\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff1b\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u867d\u6f5c\u529b\u5927\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLoRDS\uff0c\u5c06\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635S=BA\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u7a7a\u95f4\u5757\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0PTQ\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u8054\u5408QAT\u4e0e\u9ad8\u79e9\u4e58\u6cd5PEFT\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728Llama3-8B\u4e0a\uff0c3\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0b\u6bd4NormalFloat\u63d0\u534727.0%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0cRTX 4090\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f1.5\u500d\uff0c4\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0bPEFT\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4QLoRA\u63d0\u53479.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRDS\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u517c\u987e\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we show that models with stronger generalization also align more strongly with human neural activity. Moreover, generalization performance, model--model alignment, and model--brain alignment are all significantly correlated with each other. We further show that these relationships can be explained by a single geometric property of learned representations: the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings. Lower local dimension is consistently associated with stronger model--model alignment, stronger model--brain alignment, and better generalization, whereas global dimension measures fail to capture these effects. Finally, we find that increasing model capacity and training data scale systematically reduces local intrinsic dimension, providing a geometric account of the benefits of scaling.

The effect of an action is usually not identifiable under unobserved confounding, even with an infinite amount of data. Recent work uses neural networks to obtain practical bounds to such causal effects, which is often an intractable problem. However, these approaches may overfit to the dataset and be overconfident in their causal effect estimates. Moreover, there is currently no systematic approach to disentangle how much of the width of causal effect bounds is due to fundamental non-identifiability versus how much is due to finite-sample limitations. We propose a novel framework to address this problem by considering a confidence set around the empirical observational distribution and obtaining the intersection of causal effect bounds for all distributions in this confidence set. This allows us to distinguish the part of the interval that can be reduced by collecting more samples, which we call sample uncertainty, from the part that can only be reduced by observing more variables, such as latent confounders or instrumental variables, but not with more data, which we call non-ID uncertainty. The upper and lower bounds to this intersection are obtained by solving min-max and max-min problems with neural causal models by searching over all distributions that the dataset might have been sampled from, and all SCMs that entail the corresponding distribution. We demonstrate via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets that our algorithm can determine when collecting more samples will not help determine the best action.

A Principled Analysis of Softmax-family Loss", "comment": "34 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "The Softmax loss is one of the most widely employed surrogate objectives for classification and ranking tasks. To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors.

The model outputs both the solution and its scaling structure. We prove identifiability, or unique recovery, and show that, under these conditions, the squared error between learned and true exponents scales as $O(|\u03bc- \u03b1|^2)$. Across experiments, MSN-PINN achieves single-exponent recovery with 1--5% error under noise and sparse sampling. It recovers corner singularity exponents for the two-dimensional Laplace equation with 0.009% error, matches the classical result of Kondrat'ev (1967), and recovers forcing-induced exponents in singular Poisson problems with 0.03% and 0.05% errors. On a 40-configuration wedge benchmark, it reaches a 100% success rate with 0.022% mean error.

However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $\u03b1$-entmax attention with $\u03b1= 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \\to \\infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u7d27\u81f4\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u7531\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u5bfc\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u7684Transformer\u53d8\u4f53Memory Mosaics\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u77e5\u6807\u51c6softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u5e94\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u4f46\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u5c1a\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eReLu\u4e0esparsemax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94Epanechnikov\u6838\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u03b1-entmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0eEpanechnikov\u3001biweight\u3001triweight\u7b49\u6838\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6781\u9650\u60c5\u51b5\u8fd8\u539fsoftmax\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6709\u754c\u652f\u6491\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u6784\u5efa\u7684Memory Mosaics\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u542f\u53d1\u5f0ftop-k\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We introduce EntQuant, the first framework to unite the advantages of these distinct paradigms. By matching the performance of data-dependent methods with the speed and universality of data-free techniques, EntQuant enables practical utility in the extreme compression regime. Our method decouples numerical precision from storage cost via entropy coding, compressing a 70B parameter model in less than 30 minutes.

We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance.

In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes.

However, generating mixed-type features that combine discrete states with an otherwise continuous distribution in a single feature remains challenging. We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features. We formally prove that this cascade tightens the transport cost bound. The results indicate that our model generates significantly more realistic samples and captures distributional details more accurately, for example, the detection score increases by 40%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea7\u8054\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5148\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u503c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u5f15\u5bfc\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u79bb\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u81a8\u80c0\u503c\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u7eaf\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6570\u503c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8026\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u6355\u6349\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u534740%\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7ea7\u8054\u7ed3\u6784\u6536\u7d27\u4e86\u4f20\u8f93\u4ee3\u4ef7\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets.

However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure. For instance, neighbors in the explicit graph structure may be close in one modality but distant in another. Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies.

However, current energy evaluations for SNNs primarily focus on counting accumulate operations, and fail to account for real-world hardware costs such as data movement, which can consume nearly 80% of the total energy. In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs.

Bayesian oblique splits provide uncertainty-aware partitioning of the input space, while GP leaves model local functional behaviour and enable principled extrapolation beyond the observed target range. We present an efficient inference and prediction scheme that combines posterior sampling of split parameters with \\gls{gp} posterior predictions, and a gating mechanism that activates GP-based extrapolation when inputs fall outside the training support of a leaf. Experiments on benchmark regression tasks show improvements in the predictive performance compared to standard variational oblique trees, and substantial performance gains in extrapolation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5916\u63a8\u4e14\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u5dee\uff0c\u53f6\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u8303\u56f4\u5e76\u6613\u8fc7\u81ea\u4fe1", "method": "\u5728VSPYCT\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53f6\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u659c\u5207\u5206\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u56f4\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5916\u63a8", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u5206\u659c\u6811\uff0c\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u659c\u5207\u5206\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53f6\u5b50\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5916\u63a8\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1"}}

Codes in https://github.com/Chongjie-Si/Subspace-Tuning", "summary": "Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable success across diverse domains, yet fully fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT.

Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.", "AI": {"tldr": " perplexity \u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u62e9", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u7b49\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u56fe\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u4e00\u4e00\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u67d0\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e5f\u5fc5\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u5e8f\u5217\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f46\u9884\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u672a\u5fc5\u4f34\u968f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9700\u8c28\u614e\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e94\u7ed3\u5408\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7b49\u76f4\u63a5\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd"}}

In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$.

Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature.

Existing methods ignore, however, that anomalies can arise through two fundamentally different processes: measurement errors, where data was generated normally but one or more values were recorded incorrectly, and mechanism shifts, where the causal process generating the data changed. While measurement errors can often be safely corrected, mechanistic anomalies require careful consideration.

However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.

While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.\n  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faExplainerPFN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1Shapley\u503c\u7684\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfShapley\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eTabPFN\u6784\u5efaExplainerPFN\uff0c\u7528\u968f\u673a\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7cbe\u786e/\u8fd1\u4f3cShapley\u503c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "ExplainerPFN\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4ec5\u75282\u4e2a\u53c2\u8003\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u903c\u8fd1SHAP\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u793a\u4f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "ExplainerPFN\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672cShapley\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u4fc3\u8fdb\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since na\u00efve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions.

Many approaches have been proposed over the years to promote the generalisation ability of neural networks, collectively known as regularisation techniques. These are used as common practice under the assumption that any regularisation added to the pipeline would result in a performance improvement. In this study, we investigate whether this assumption holds in practice. First, we provide a broad review of regularisation techniques, including modern theories such as double descent. We propose a taxonomy of methods under four broad categories, namely: (1) data-based strategies, (2) architecture strategies, (3) training strategies, and (4) loss function strategies. Notably, we highlight the contradictions and correspondences between the approaches in these broad classes. Further, we perform an empirical comparison of the various regularisation techniques on classification tasks for ten numerical and image datasets applied to the multi-layer perceptron and convolutional neural network architectures. Results show that the efficacy of regularisation is dataset-dependent. For example, the use of a regularisation term only improved performance on numeric datasets, whereas batch normalisation improved performance on image datasets only. Generalisation is crucial to machine learning; thus, understanding the effects of applying regularisation techniques, and considering the connections between them is essential to the appropriate use of these methods in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u603b\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4efb\u4f55\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u90fd\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u5047\u8bbe\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u7c7b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6570\u636e\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5341\u7ec4\u6570\u503c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bf9MLP\u548cCNN\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u679c\u5177\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1a\u6570\u503c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4ec5\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4ec5\u6279\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u5404\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u77db\u76fe\u4e0e\u5173\u8054\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e76\u975e\u4e07\u80fd\uff0c\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u771f\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Among RL algorithms, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is the de facto standard, avoiding the need for a critic by using per-prompt baselines and variance normalization. Yet why and when this normalization helps remains unclear. In this work, we provide an explanation through the lens of local curvature of the sequence-level policy gradient: standard deviation normalization implements an adaptive gradient. Theoretically, under mild conditions, GRPO enjoys a strictly improved convergence rate over unnormalized REINFORCE, with gains characterized by the average within-prompt reward standard deviation across prompts and iterations. Empirically, our analysis on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks reveals three distinct training phases governed by the interplay between feature orthogonality and reward variance: (I) an early acceleration phase where high variance and orthogonality favor adaptive scaling; (II) a relatively stable transition phase; and (III) a late-stage regime where the loss of orthogonality limits further gains.

However, IoT systems are vulnerable to clock drift, time-synchronization manipulation, and timestamp discontinuities, such as the Year 2038 (Y2K38) Unix overflow, all of which disrupt temporal ordering. Conventional anomaly-detection models, which assume reliable timestamps, fail to capture temporal inconsistencies. This paper introduces STGAT (Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network), a framework that models both temporal distortion and inter-device consistency in energy IoT systems. STGAT combines drift-aware temporal embeddings and temporal self-attention to capture corrupted time evolution at individual devices, and uses graph attention to model spatial propagation of timing errors. A curvature-regularized latent representation geometrically separates normal clock evolution from anomalies caused by drift, synchronization offsets, and overflow events. Experimental results on energy IoT telemetry with controlled timing perturbations show that STGAT achieves 95.7% accuracy, outperforming recurrent, transformer, and graph-based baselines with significant improvements (d > 1.8, p < 0.001).

This trend has inspired practical and academic interest in model editing, that is, in adjusting the weights of the model to modify its likely outputs for queries relating to a specific fact or set of facts. This may be done either to amend a fact or set of facts, for instance, to fix a frequent error in the training data, or to suppress a fact or set of facts entirely, for instance, in case of dangerous knowledge. Multiple methods have been proposed to do such edits. However, at the same time, it has been shown that such model editing can be brittle and incomplete. Moreover the effectiveness of any model editing method necessarily depends on the data on which the model is trained, and, therefore, a good understanding of the interaction of the training data distribution and the way it is stored in the network is necessary and helpful to reliably perform model editing. However, working with large language models trained on real-world data does not allow us to understand this relationship or fully measure the effects of model editing. We therefore propose Behemoth, a fully synthetic data generation framework. To demonstrate the practical insights from the framework, we explore model editing in the context of simple tabular data, demonstrating surprising findings that, in some cases, echo real-world results, for instance, that in some cases restricting the update rank results in a more effective update.

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6839\u636e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u5316ICU\u9547\u75db\u7528\u836f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u75bc\u75db\u7f13\u89e3\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ICU\u9547\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5ffd\u89c6\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cbb\u7597\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d47,144\u4f8bICU\u4f4f\u9662\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u8054\u5408\u964d\u4f4e\u75bc\u75db\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u8bad\u7ec3\u7528\u836f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u75bc\u75db\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u7528\u836f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728ICU\u9547\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4ee5\u77ed\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u4e3b\uff0c\u4e5f\u9700\u7eb3\u5165\u957f\u671f\u751f\u5b58\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6709\u5bb3\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

In practice, however, we identify alleviating gradient conflicts, misalignment between per-sample gradients, is a key factor that slows down the decay of marginal log-determinant information gains, thereby preventing significant loss of information. We formalize this via an $\\varepsilon$-decomposition that quantifies the deviation from ideal submodularity as a function of conflict statistics, yielding data-dependent approximation factors that tighten as conflicts diminish. Guided by this analysis, we propose SPICE, a conflict-aware selector that maximizes information while penalizing misalignment, and that supports early stopping and proxy models for efficiency. Empirically, SPICE selects subsets with higher log-determinant information than original criteria, and these informational gains translate into performance improvements: across 8 benchmarks with LLaMA2-7B and Qwen2-7B, SPICE uses only 10% of the data, yet matches or exceeds 6 methods including full-data tuning.

While recent approaches have sought to segment trajectories into reusable skills or options, most rely on action labels, rewards, or handcrafted annotations, limiting their applicability. We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u6280\u80fd\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u590d\u7528\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u65e0\u9700\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u6280\u80fd\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u4f4e\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u50cf\u7d20\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982Craftax\u548c\u672a\u4fee\u6539\u7684Minecraft\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\u3001\u590d\u7528\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bed\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6280\u80fd\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u622a\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4fe1\u5fc3\u968f\u63a8\u7406token\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u7531\u5185\u5bb9\u800c\u975e\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2d\u95f4\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u5426\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8d8a\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6309\u56fa\u5b9atoken\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u622a\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u6982\u7387\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b54\u6848\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4fe1\u5fc3\u968f\u63a8\u7406token\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u5185\u5bb9\u800c\u975e\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u98ce\u683c\uff1b\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4fee\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f46\u521d\u59cb\u56de\u7b54\u4ecd\u53d7\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2d\u95f4token\u662f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions. Using Partial Least Squares Regression, we predict pollution levels based on these newly defined traffic intensities.

Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule.

This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale.\n  In seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL).

Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner.

In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks.

Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u8026\u6269\u6563\u9006\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08DDIS\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9006PDE\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7cfb\u6570\u4e0e\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u5f15\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DDIS\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u524d\u5411PDE\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u9000\u706b\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\uff08DAPS\uff09\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\uff0cDDIS\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e11% L2\u8bef\u5dee\u548c54%\u9891\u8c31\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u4ec51%\u65f6\uff0cL2\u8bef\u5dee\u4ecd\u6bd4\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u4f4e40%\u3002", "conclusion": "DDIS\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}
