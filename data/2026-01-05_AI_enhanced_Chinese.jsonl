An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8614\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5065\u5eb7\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6545\u969c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u7403\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff082D\u548c10D\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u73870.05%-20%\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c1000-10000\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf914\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e3a40000\u3002", "result": "\u5c11\u4e8e20\u4e2a\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08kNN/LOF\uff09\u6700\u4f18\uff1b30-50\u4e2a\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\uff08XGBOD\uff09\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SVM/CatBoost\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u589e\u81f310\u65f6\uff0c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u589e\u52a0\u5065\u5eb7\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u786e\u4fdd\u8db3\u591f\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u76f2\u76ee\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u9700\u6839\u636e\u6545\u969c\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) offers a formal and expressive framework for specifying such time-bounded requirements; however, integrating MITL with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to stochastic dynamics and partial observability. This paper presents a unified automata-based RL framework for synthesizing policies in both Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) under MITL specifications. MITL formulas are translated into Timed Limit-Deterministic Generalized B\u00fcchi Automata (Timed-LDGBA) and synchronized with the underlying decision process to construct product timed models suitable for Q-learning. A simple yet expressive reward structure enforces temporal correctness while allowing additional performance objectives. The approach is validated in three simulation studies: a $5 \\times 5$ grid-world formulated as an MDP, a $10 \\times 10$ grid-world formulated as a POMDP, and an office-like service-robot scenario. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently learns policies that satisfy strict time-bounded requirements under stochastic transitions, scales to larger state spaces, and remains effective in partially observable environments, highlighting its potential for reliable robotic planning in time-critical and uncertain settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728MDP\u548cPOMDP\u4e2d\u6ee1\u8db3MITL\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u878d\u5408MITL\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6", "method": "\u5c06MITL\u516c\u5f0f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aTimed-LDGBA\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u4e0eMDP/POMDP\u6784\u5efa\u4e58\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfcQ\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u5e8f\u8981\u6c42", "result": "\u57285x5 MDP\u300110x10 POMDP\u548c\u529e\u516c\u670d\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5927\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

This compositional paradigm spans diverse domains, from multi-step manipulation planning to panoramic image synthesis to long video generation. However, compositional generative models face a critical challenge: when local distributions are multimodal, existing composition methods average incompatible modes, producing plans that are neither locally feasible nor globally coherent. We propose Compositional Diffusion with Guided Search (CDGS), which addresses this \\emph{mode averaging} problem by embedding search directly within the diffusion denoising process. Our method explores diverse combinations of local modes through population-based sampling, prunes infeasible candidates using likelihood-based filtering, and enforces global consistency through iterative resampling between overlapping segments. CDGS matches oracle performance on seven robot manipulation tasks, outperforming baselines that lack compositionality or require long-horizon training data. The approach generalizes across domains, enabling coherent text-guided panoramic images and long videos through effective local-to-global message passing.

A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single \"breaker token\" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

However, in many applications, such areas of interest are unknown and should be identified online during exploration. Thus, this paper considers the problem of simultaneous exploration, inspection of unknown environments and then real-time communication to a mobile ground control station to report the findings. The heterogeneous robots are equipped with different sensors, e.g., long-range lidars for fast exploration and close-range cameras for detailed inspection. Furthermore, global communication is often unavailable in such environments, where the robots can only communicate with each other via ad-hoc wireless networks when they are in close proximity and free of obstruction. This work proposes a novel planning and coordination framework (SLEI3D) that integrates the online strategies for collaborative 3D exploration, adaptive inspection and timely communication (via the intermit-tent or proactive protocols). To account for uncertainties w.r.t. the number and location of features, a multi-layer and multi-rate planning mechanism is developed for inter-and-intra robot subgroups, to actively meet and coordinate their local plans. The proposed framework is validated extensively via high-fidelity simulations of numerous large-scale missions with up to 48 robots and 384 thousand cubic meters.

Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges.\n  Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions.

Previous efforts for perching on vertical surfaces have predominantly focused on lightweight mechanical design solutions with relatively scant system-level integration.

This work presents the preliminary investigation of a perching approach suitable for larger drones that both gently perches on vertical tree trunks and reacts and recovers from perch failures. The system in this work, called SLAP, consists of vision-based perch site detector, an IMU (inertial-measurement-unit)-based perch failure detector, an attitude controller for soft perching, an optical close-range detection system, and a fast active elastic gripper with microspines made from commercially-available slapbands. We validated this approach on a modified 1.2 kg commercial quadrotor with component and system analysis.

While recent video generation models have demonstrated impressive visual quality, they remain limited in real-time interaction, long-horizon consistency, and persistent memory of dynamic scenes, hindering their evolution into practical world models. In this report, we present TeleWorld, a real-time multimodal 4D world modeling framework that unifies video generation, dynamic scene reconstruction, and long-term world memory within a closed-loop system. TeleWorld introduces a novel generation-reconstruction-guidance paradigm, where generated video streams are continuously reconstructed into a dynamic 4D spatio-temporal representation, which in turn guides subsequent generation to maintain spatial, temporal, and physical consistency. To support long-horizon generation with low latency, we employ an autoregressive diffusion-based video model enhanced with Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)--a hierarchical planning method that reduces error accumulation from frame-level to segment-level-alongside efficient Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), enabling real-time synthesis under practical computational budgets. Our approach achieves seamless integration of dynamic object modeling and static scene representation within a unified 4D framework, advancing world models toward practical, interactive, and computationally accessible systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeleWorld achieves strong performance in both static and dynamic world understanding, long-term consistency, and real-time generation efficiency, positioning it as a practical step toward interactive, memory-enabled world models for multimodal generation and embodied intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "TeleWorld\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u60014D\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210-\u91cd\u5efa-\u5f15\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b8f\u5fae\u89c2\u89c4\u5212\uff08MMPL\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u84b8\u998f\uff08DMD\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5b9e\u65f64D\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "TeleWorld\u5728\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "TeleWorld\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u5b9e\u7528\u3001\u5e26\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u662f\u8fc8\u5411\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances.

Designing paint paths for these robotic arms, which involves assigning car body areas to arms and determining paint sequences for each arm, remains a time-consuming manual task for engineers, indicating the demand for automation and design time reduction. The unique constraints of the painting process hinder the direct application of conventional robotic path planning techniques, such as those used in welding. Therefore, this paper formulates the design of paint paths as a hierarchical optimization problem, where the upper-layer subproblem resembles a vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the lower-layer subproblem involves detailed path planning. This approach allows the use of different optimization algorithms at each layer, and permits flexible handling of constraints specific to the vehicle painting process through the design of variable representation, constraints, repair operators, and an initialization process at the upper and lower layers.

To that end, we derive a three-stage framework, each with a dedicated extended Kalman filter. This framework utilizes the benefits of each location (wheel/body) during the estimation process. To evaluate our proposed approach, we employed a dataset with five inertial measurement units with a total recording time of 228.6 minutes. We compare our approach with four other inertial baselines and demonstrate an average position error of 11.4m, which is $2.4\\%$ of the average traveled distance, using two wheels and one body inertial measurement units. As a consequence, our proposed method enables robust navigation in challenging environments and helps bridge the pure-inertial performance gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWiCHINS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f6e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5e95\u76d8IMU\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728GNSS\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u5dee\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u56e0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bef\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u8f6e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5e95\u76d8\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5b89\u88c5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f18\u52bf\u8fdb\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728228.6\u5206\u949f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u8f6e\u4e00\u5e95\u76d8IMU\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a11.4\u7c73\uff0c\u5360\u5e73\u5747\u884c\u9a76\u8ddd\u79bb\u76842.4%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u56db\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WiCHINS\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

We systematically organize these tasks into six cognitive categories: object understanding, scene understanding, spatial relationship understanding, spatiotemporal relationship understanding, spatial reasoning and spatiotemporal reasoning. Spatial4D-Bench thereby offers a structured and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the spatial cognition abilities of MLLMs, covering a broad spectrum of tasks that parallel the versatility of human spatial intelligence. We benchmark various state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs on Spatial4D-Bench and reveal their substantial limitations in a wide variety of 4D spatial reasoning aspects, such as route plan, action recognition, and physical plausibility reasoning.

A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping.

In particular, during the response stage, when timely and accurate information is important, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are primarily employed to produce water extent maps. Recently, leveraging the complementary characteristics of SAR and MSI data through a multimodal approach has emerged as a promising strategy for advancing water extent mapping using deep learning models. This approach is particularly beneficial when timely post-flood observations, acquired during or shortly after the flood peak, are limited, as it enables the use of all available imagery for more accurate post-flood water extent mapping. However, the adaptive integration of partially available MSI data into the SAR-based post-flood water extent mapping process remains underexplored. To bridge this research gap, we propose the Spatially Masked Adaptive Gated Network (SMAGNet), a multimodal deep learning model that utilizes SAR data as the primary input for post-flood water extent mapping and integrates complementary MSI data through feature fusion. In experiments on the C2S-MS Floods dataset, SMAGNet consistently outperformed other multimodal deep learning models in prediction performance across varying levels of MSI data availability. Furthermore, we found that even when MSI data were completely missing, the performance of SMAGNet remained statistically comparable to that of a U-Net model trained solely on SAR data. These findings indicate that SMAGNet enhances the model robustness to missing data as well as the applicability of multimodal deep learning in real-world flood management scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSMAGNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u878d\u5408SAR\u4e0eMSI\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6d2a\u6c34\u6df9\u6ca1\u5236\u56fe\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7fMSI\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u7528MSI\u6570\u636e\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u5230SAR\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u5236\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpatially Masked Adaptive Gated Network (SMAGNet)\uff0c\u4ee5SAR\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6574\u5408MSI\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u90e8\u5206\u7f3a\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728C2S-MS Floods\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSMAGNet\u5728\u4e0d\u540cMSI\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5373\u4f7fMSI\u5b8c\u5168\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u4e0e\u7eafSAR\u7684U-Net\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "SMAGNet\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6d2a\u6c34\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets.

Hybrid Factor Graphs give us a mathematical framework to model these types of problems, however existing approaches for solving them are based on approximations. In this work, we propose an efficient Hybrid Factor Graph framework alongwith a variable elimination algorithm to produce a hybrid Bayes network, which can then be used for exact Maximum A Posteriori estimation and marginalization over both sets of variables. Our approach first develops a novel hybrid Gaussian factor which can connect to both discrete and continuous variables, and a hybrid conditional which can represent multiple continuous hypotheses conditioned on the discrete variables. Using these representations, we derive the process of hybrid variable elimination under the Conditional Linear Gaussian scheme, giving us exact posteriors as hybrid Bayes network. To bound the number of discrete hypotheses, we use a tree-structured representation of the factors coupled with a simple pruning and probabilistic assignment scheme, which allows for tractable inference.

However, extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients remains largely unexplored, as existing approaches continue to rely heavily on supervised sequence-modeling objectives during online finetuning. We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions.

Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models.

Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems.

In Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP), the objective is typically to minimize the makespan by generating non-overlapping paths for full-area coverage. However, most existing methods assume uniform importance across regions, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios where some zones require faster attention. We introduce the Priority-Aware MCPP (PA-MCPP) problem, where a subset of the environment is designated as prioritized zones with associated weights. The goal is to minimize, in lexicographic order, the total priority-weighted latency of zone coverage and the overall makespan. To address this, we propose a scalable two-phase framework combining (1) greedy zone assignment with local search, spanning-tree-based path planning, and (2) Steiner-tree-guided residual coverage. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces priority-weighted latency compared to standard MCPP baselines, while maintaining competitive makespan. Sensitivity analyses further show that the method scales well with the number of robots and that zone coverage behavior can be effectively controlled by adjusting priority weights.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5148\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8986\u76d6\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff08PA-MCPP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u52a0\u6743\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u533a\u57df\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u9700\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3a\u8d2a\u5fc3\u533a\u57df\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6811\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3aSteiner\u6811\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6b8b\u4f59\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4f18\u5148\u52a0\u6743\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u968f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\u8986\u76d6\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "PA-MCPP\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f18\u5148\u533a\u57df\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

To achieve this capability, we construct a new multi-attribute description dataset for arbitrarily selected face regions, providing rich region-level annotations and natural language descriptions. Further, we propose a fine-tuned vision-language model based on Qwen2.5-VL, called Focal-RegionFace for facial state analysis, which incrementally refines its focus on localized facial features through multiple progressively fine-tuning stages, resulting in interpretable age estimation, FAU and emotion detection.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4.

In this study, we present DichroGAN, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) designed for this purpose.

Next, a third generator receives as input the generated scene radiance containing the features of each spectral band, while a fourth generator estimates the underwater light transmission. These generators work together to remove the effects of light absorption and scattering, restoring the in-air colours of seafloor based on the underwater image formation equation.

We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u590d\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u7f16\u7801\uff08\u5982LDPC\u3001Reed-Solomon\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4f4e\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u4fe1\u8bed\u4e49\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u771f\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u6309\u7ef4\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u590d\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u57281 dB SNR\u4e0b\uff0cchrF\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u53476.8%\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f53\u4fdd\u7559\u7387\u63d0\u9ad89.3%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5747\u5300\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u901a\u4fe1\u9700\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u8bed\u4e49\u7f51\u7edc\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We present MorphAny3D, a training-free framework that leverages Structured Latent (SLAT) representations for high-quality 3D morphing. Our key insight is that intelligently blending source and target SLAT features within the attention mechanisms of 3D generators naturally produces plausible morphing sequences. To this end, we introduce Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA), which fuses source and target information for structural coherence, and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA), which enhances temporal consistency by incorporating features from preceding frames. An orientation correction strategy further mitigates the pose ambiguity within the morphing steps. Extensive experiments show that our method generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for challenging cross-category cases. MorphAny3D further supports advanced applications such as decoupled morphing and 3D style transfer, and can be generalized to other SLAT-based generative models.

Manual classification of their neuronal spike patterns is very labor-intensive and expensive. Most available deep learning solutions require fully labeled spike datasets and highly preprocessed neuronal signals. This reduces the feasibility of mass adoption in actual field scenarios. To address the scarcity of labeled data problems, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that we call the Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN (SSI-GAN). The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level.

Beksi"], "title": "CropNeRF: A Neural Radiance Field-Based Framework for Crop Counting", "comment": "8 pages, 10 figures, and 2 tables", "summary": "Rigorous crop counting is crucial for effective agricultural management and informed intervention strategies. However, in outdoor field environments, partial occlusions combined with inherent ambiguity in distinguishing clustered crops from individual viewpoints poses an immense challenge for image-based segmentation methods. To address these problems, we introduce a novel crop counting framework designed for exact enumeration via 3D instance segmentation. Our approach utilizes 2D images captured from multiple viewpoints and associates independent instance masks for neural radiance field (NeRF) view synthesis. We introduce crop visibility and mask consistency scores, which are incorporated alongside 3D information from a NeRF model. This results in an effective segmentation of crop instances in 3D and highly-accurate crop counts. Furthermore, our method eliminates the dependence on crop-specific parameter tuning.

This hybrid feature space, combining wavelet decompositions and graph-theoretic descriptors, is then refined using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling interpretable, ultra-lightweight linear classifiers.

In real-world robotic domains, obtaining such rewards typically requires either labor-intensive human labeling or brittle, handcrafted objectives. Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic reward models, yet their effectiveness on real robot tasks is poorly understood. In this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing (1) \\textbf{RoboReward}, a robotics reward dataset and benchmark built on large-scale real-robot corpora from Open X-Embodiment (OXE) and RoboArena, and (2) vision-language reward models trained on this dataset (RoboReward 4B/8B).

Using this framework, we produce an extensive training and evaluation dataset that spans diverse tasks and embodiments and enables systematic evaluation of whether state-of-the-art VLMs can reliably provide rewards for robotics. Our evaluation of leading open-weight and proprietary VLMs reveals that no model excels across all tasks, underscoring substantial room for improvement. We then train general-purpose 4B- and 8B-parameter models that outperform much larger VLMs in assigning rewards for short-horizon robotic tasks. Finally, we deploy the 8B-parameter reward VLM in real-robot reinforcement learning and find that it improves policy learning over Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a frontier physical reasoning VLM trained on robotics data, by a large margin, while substantially narrowing the gap to RL training with human-provided rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRoboReward\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cVLM\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u5206\u914d\uff0c8B\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u578bVLM\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u5956\u52b1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u624b\u5de5\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaRoboReward\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u91cd\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u88c1\u526a\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec34B/8B\u53c2\u6570\u7684VLM\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u65f6\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21VLM\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eGemini Robotics-ER 1.5\uff0c\u903c\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u5956\u52b1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u4e2d\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Prior studies mainly focus on the domain shift between the source and target domains, whereas the intra-domain variability remains under-explored. To address the latter, an effective strategy is to diversify the styles of the synthetic target domain data during image translation. However, previous methods typically require intra-domain variations to be pre-specified for style synthesis, which may be impractical. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based style synthesis method named IntraStyler, which can capture diverse intra-domain styles without any prior knowledge. Specifically, IntraStyler uses an exemplar image to guide the style synthesis such that the output style matches the exemplar style. To extract the style-only features, we introduce a style encoder to learn styles discriminatively based on contrastive learning. We evaluate the proposed method on the largest public dataset for cross-modality domain adaptation, CrossMoDA 2023.

Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high.

Submitted to RA-L", "summary": "Deformable scenes violate the rigidity assumptions underpinning classical visual-inertial odometry (VIO), often leading to over-fitting to local non-rigid motion or severe drift when deformation dominates visual parallax. We introduce DefVINS, a visual-inertial odometry framework that explicitly separates a rigid, IMU-anchored state from a non--rigid warp represented by an embedded deformation graph. The system is initialized using a standard VIO procedure that fixes gravity, velocity, and IMU biases, after which non-rigid degrees of freedom are activated progressively as the estimation becomes well conditioned. An observability analysis is included to characterize how inertial measurements constrain the rigid motion and render otherwise unobservable modes identifiable in the presence of deformation. This analysis motivates the use of IMU anchoring and informs a conditioning-based activation strategy that prevents ill-posed updates under poor excitation.

However, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generate reasoning that lacks integration of visual information.

We show that visual perception is the key bottleneck in such tasks: converting images into textual descriptions significantly improves performance, yielding gains of 26.7% for Claude 3.5 and 23.6% for Claude 3.7.\n  To address this, we investigate reward-driven RL as a mechanism to unlock long visual reasoning in open-source MLLMs without requiring costly supervision. We design and evaluate six reward functions targeting different reasoning aspects, including image understanding, thinking steps, and answer accuracy. Using group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly incentivizes longer, structured reasoning and mitigates bypassing of visual information.

Our AGP has two key aspects. First, we propose the general problem formulation of AGP as a min-max optimization problem and develop an alternating optimization scheme to solve it. For inner maximization, we propose Joint Projected Gradient Descent (JointPGD) algorithm to generate strong adversarial noise. For outer minimization, we employ a simple yet effective module to learn the optimal node prompts to counteract the adversarial noise. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed AGP can theoretically address both graph topology and node noise. This confirms the versatility and robustness of our AGP fine-tuning method across various graph noise. Note that, the proposed AGP is a general method that can be integrated with various pre-trained GNN models to enhance their robustness on the downstream tasks.

While prior research has examined adult reactions to successive robot errors, children's responses remain largely unexplored. In this study, we explore children's reactions to robot social errors and performance errors. For the latter, this study reproduces the successive robot failure paradigm of Liu et al. with child participants (N=59, ages 8-10) to examine how young users respond to repeated robot conversational errors. Participants interacted with a robot that failed to understand their prompts three times in succession, with their behavioral responses video-recorded and analyzed. We found both similarities and differences compared to adult responses from the original study. Like adults, children adjusted their prompts, modified their verbal tone, and exhibited increasingly emotional non-verbal responses throughout successive errors. However, children demonstrated more disengagement behaviors, including temporarily ignoring the robot or actively seeking an adult. Errors did not affect participants' perception of the robot, suggesting more flexible conversational expectations in children.

As the diversity and complexity of data and models continue to increase, there is an urgent need for high-capacity, yet more compact VQ methods. This paper aims to reconcile this conflict by presenting a new approach called LooC, which utilizes an effective Low-dimensional codebook for Compositional vector quantization. Firstly, LooC introduces a parameter-efficient codebook by reframing the relationship between codevectors and feature vectors, significantly expanding its solution space. Instead of individually matching codevectors with feature vectors, LooC treats them as lower-dimensional compositional units within feature vectors and combines them, resulting in a more compact codebook with improved performance. Secondly, LooC incorporates a parameter-free extrapolation-by-interpolation mechanism to enhance and smooth features during the VQ process, which allows for better preservation of details and fidelity in feature approximation. The design of LooC leads to full codebook usage, effectively utilizing the compact codebook while avoiding the problem of collapse. Thirdly, LooC can serve as a plug-and-play module for existing methods for different downstream tasks based on VQ. Finally, extensive evaluations on different tasks, datasets, and architectures demonstrate that LooC outperforms existing VQ methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a significantly smaller codebook.", "AI": {"tldr": "LooC\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u7801\u672c\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0e\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "LooC\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7801\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ec4\u5408\u5355\u5143\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u63d2\u503c\u5916\u63a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u7801\u672c\u574d\u584c\u3002", "result": "LooC\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u7801\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LooC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u7684VQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

We introduce GRIT, a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure that preserves the LoRA parameterization but: (1) preconditions gradients in rank space using K-FAC as a natural-gradient proxy; (2) periodically reprojects the low-rank basis onto dominant Fisher eigendirections to suppress drift; and (3) adapts the effective rank from the spectrum so capacity concentrates where signal resides. Across instruction-following, comprehension, and reasoning benchmarks on LLaMA backbones, GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average (25--80% across tasks), without practical quality loss across prompt styles and data mixes.

While synthetic data offers a promising solution, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often show limited generalization ability. In this work, we make a key observation that representations learned from synthetic datasets often exhibit a discrete and clustered pattern that hinders regression performance: features of high-quality images cluster around reference images, while those of low-quality images cluster based on distortion types. Our analysis reveals that this issue stems from the distribution of synthetic data rather than model architecture. Consequently, we introduce a novel framework SynDR-IQA, which reshapes synthetic data distribution to enhance BIQA generalization. Based on theoretical derivations of sample diversity and redundancy's impact on generalization error, SynDR-IQA employs two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling, which enhances visual diversity while preserving content distribution, and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling, which balances samples by reducing the density of densely clustered areas. Extensive experiments across three cross-dataset settings (synthetic-to-authentic, synthetic-to-algorithmic, and synthetic-to-synthetic) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Traditional pest management methods depend heavily on manual field inspections and the use of chemical pesticides. These approaches are often costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and can have a negative impact on the environment. To overcome these challenges, this study presents a lightweight framework for pest detection and pesticide recommendation, designed for low-resource devices such as smartphones and drones, making it suitable for use by small and marginal farmers.\n  The proposed framework includes two main components. The first is a Pest Detection Module that uses a compact, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with prototypical meta-learning to accurately identify pests even when only a few training samples are available. The second is a Pesticide Recommendation Module that incorporates environmental factors like crop type and growth stage to suggest safe and eco-friendly pesticide recommendations. To train and evaluate our framework, a comprehensive pest image dataset was developed by combining multiple publicly available datasets. The final dataset contains samples with different viewing angles, pest sizes, and background conditions to ensure strong generalization.\n  Experimental results show that the proposed lightweight CNN achieves high accuracy, comparable to state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing computational complexity.

We introduce Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a NISQ-scale benchmark derived from chess tactical positions that provides 5,000 structured instances with one-hot constraints, spatial locality, and 10--40 qubit scale. The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit. Intrinsic validation shows QAOA outperforms greedy heuristics by 12.6\\% and random selection by 80.1\\%.

In this paper, we propose DVEFormer - an efficient RGB-D Transformer-based approach that predicts dense text-aligned visual embeddings (DVE) via knowledge distillation. Instead of directly performing classical semantic segmentation with fixed predefined classes, our method uses teacher embeddings from Alpha-CLIP to guide our efficient student model DVEFormer in learning fine-grained pixel-wise embeddings. While this approach still enables classical semantic segmentation, e.g., via linear probing, it further enables flexible text-based querying and other applications, such as creating comprehensive 3D maps. Evaluations on common indoor datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance while meeting real-time requirements, operating at 26.3 FPS for the full model and 77.0 FPS for a smaller variant on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

In zero-shot organ-wise lesion classification tasks, the proposed model achieved higher F1 scores in 83% (5/6) of organs compared to CT-CLIP and 64% (9/14) of organs compared to Merlin. These results suggest that the proposed model exhibits high generalization performance in a clinical evaluation setting using actual radiology report sentences. Furthermore, in zero-shot finding-wise lesion classification tasks, our model achieved a higher AUROC in 83% (25/30) of finding categories compared to Merlin.

However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9006\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65ad\u4ee3\u7406\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u9006\u535a\u5f08\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c4\u5212\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u4e8e\u81ea\u4fe1\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7eb3\u4ec0\u535a\u5f08\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u9006\u535a\u5f08\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%. Using a normal Central Processing Unit (CPU), H-ELM's training time takes 445 seconds.

Existing concept erasure methods address these risks by removing sensitive concepts from pre-trained models, but most of them rely on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning, which poses a critical limitation. To overcome these challenges, inspired by the observation that the model's activations are predominantly composed of generic concepts, with only a minimal component can represent the target concept, we propose a novel training-free method (ActErase) for efficient concept erasure. Specifically, the proposed method operates by identifying activation difference regions via prompt-pair analysis, extracting target activations and dynamically replacing input activations during forward passes. Comprehensive evaluations across three critical erasure tasks (nudity, artistic style, and object removal) demonstrates that our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) erasure performance, while effectively preserving the model's overall generative capability. Our approach also exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, establishing a new plug-and-play paradigm for lightweight yet effective concept manipulation in diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08ActErase\uff09\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6e05\u9664\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u66f4\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u5f02\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u76ee\u6807\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e76\u5728\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u6362\u8f93\u5165\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u88f8\u4f53\u3001\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u79fb\u9664\u4e09\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u64e6\u9664\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ActErase\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6982\u5ff5\u64cd\u63a7\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\\mathbf{k}(\\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $\u03b2(\\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $\u03b2(\\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDeep Delta Learning (DDL)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u6cdb\u5316\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u52a0\u6027\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Delta\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u4f4d\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u79e9-1\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7531\u53cd\u5c04\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u95e8\u63a7\u6807\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6052\u7b49\u3001\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63d2\u503c\u3002", "result": "DDL\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8c31\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u590d\u6742\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "DDL\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u8c03\u5236\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u52a0\u6027\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding.

This growing reliance has raised increasing concerns regarding model interpretability and accountability, particularly as legal and regulatory frameworks place tighter constraints on using black-box models in critical applications. Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.\n  To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f3016\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u5728216\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9ed1\u7bb1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u95ee\u8d23\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u56fa\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5728216\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f3016\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6309\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "EBM\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff1bSR\u548cIGANN\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff1bGOSDT\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u6743\u8861\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Standard approaches for dynamic object reconstruction require dense coverage in both the viewing space and the temporal dimension, typically relying on multi-view videos captured at each time step. However, such setups are only possible in constrained environments. In real-world scenarios, observations are often sparse over time and captured sparsely from diverse viewpoints (e.g., from security cameras), making dynamic reconstruction highly ill-posed. We present SV-GS, a framework that simultaneously estimates a deformation model and the object's motion over time under sparse observations. To initialize SV-GS, we leverage a rough skeleton graph and an initial static reconstruction as inputs to guide motion estimation. (Later, we show that this input requirement can be relaxed.) Our method optimizes a skeleton-driven deformation field composed of a coarse skeleton joint pose estimator and a module for fine-grained deformations. By making only the joint pose estimator time-dependent, our model enables smooth motion interpolation while preserving learned geometric details. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches under sparse observations by up to 34% in PSNR, and achieves comparable performance to dense monocular video methods on real-world datasets despite using significantly fewer frames. Moreover, we demonstrate that the input initial static reconstruction can be replaced by a diffusion-based generative prior, making our method more practical for real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "SV-GS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u66ff\u6362\u521d\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u76d1\u63a7\u6444\u50cf\u5934\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSV-GS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9aa8\u67b6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5173\u8282\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u66ff\u4ee3\u521d\u59cb\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0aPSNR\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe34%\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4ee5\u6781\u5c11\u5e27\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SV-GS\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most previous studies focused on static scenarios where the data and concepts are assumed to be fixed and clean. In real-world applications, deployed models require continuous maintenance: we often need to remove erroneous or sensitive data (unlearning), correct mislabeled concepts, or incorporate newly acquired samples (incremental learning) to adapt to evolving environments. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs).

However, prevailing data augmentation strategies for videos remain largely perturbation-driven, often introducing uncontrolled variations that amplify non-discriminative factors, which finally weaken intra-class distributional structure and representation drift with inconsistent gains across temporal scales. To address these problems, we propose Representation-aware Mixing Augmentation (ReMA), a plug-and-play augmentation strategy that formulates mixing as a controlled replacement process to expand representations while preserving class-conditional stability. ReMA integrates two complementary mechanisms. Firstly, the Representation Alignment Mechanism (RAM) performs structured intra-class mixing under distributional alignment constraints, suppressing irrelevant intra-class drift while enhancing statistical reliability. Then, the Dynamic Selection Mechanism (DSM) generates motion-aware spatiotemporal masks to localize perturbations, guiding them away from discrimination-sensitive regions and promoting temporal coherence. By jointly controlling how and where mixing is applied, ReMA improves representation robustness without additional supervision or trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on diverse video behavior benchmarks demonstrate that ReMA consistently enhances generalization and robustness across different spatiotemporal granularities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5ReMA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u66ff\u6362\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u5f81\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u6270\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u7c7b\u5185\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u589e\u76ca\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4", "method": "ReMA\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff08RAM\uff09\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u5185\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u65e0\u5173\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff08DSM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6270\u52a8\u907f\u5f00\u654f\u611f\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u76d1\u7763", "conclusion": "ReMA\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def"}}

We introduce a principled joint penalty for the collection of user reward functions $\\{f_u\\}$, combining a graph smoothness term based on RKHS distances with an individual roughness penalty. Our central contribution is proving that this penalty is equivalent to the squared norm within a single, unified \\emph{multi-user RKHS}. We explicitly derive its reproducing kernel, which elegantly fuses the graph Laplacian with the base arm kernel. This unification allows us to reframe the problem as learning a single ''lifted'' function, enabling the design of principled algorithms, \\texttt{LK-GP-UCB} and \\texttt{LK-GP-TS}, that leverage Gaussian Process posteriors over this new kernel for exploration. We provide high-probability regret bounds that scale with an \\emph{effective dimension} of the multi-user kernel, replacing dependencies on user count or ambient dimension. Empirically, our methods outperform strong linear and non-graph-aware baselines in non-linear settings and remain competitive even when the true rewards are linear.

Existing studies typically resort to decoupled pipelines for geometry estimation and appearance synthesis, often hindering unified reconstruction and causing inconsistencies. This paper introduces \\textbf{JGA-LBD}, a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and appearance into a joint latent representation and formulates the generation process as bridge diffusion. Observing that directly integrating heterogeneous input conditions (e.g., depth maps, SMPL models) leads to substantial training difficulties, we unify all conditions into the 3D Gaussian representations, which can be further compressed into a unified latent space through a shared sparse variational autoencoder (VAE). Subsequently, the specialized form of bridge diffusion enables to start with a partial observation of the target latent code and solely focuses on inferring the missing components. Finally, a dedicated decoding module extracts the complete 3D human geometric structure and renders novel views from the inferred latent representation. Experiments demonstrate that JGA-LBD outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both geometry fidelity and appearance quality, including challenging in-the-wild scenarios.

A comparative analysis of the numerical solution of the (viscid and inviscid) Burgers and Eikonal equations via standard numerical discretization (also cast in terms of neural chains) and via PINN's learning is presented and commented on. It is found that standard numerical discretization and PINN learning provide two different paths to acquire essentially the same knowledge about the dynamics of the system. PINN learning proceeds through random matrices which bear no direct relation to the highly structured matrices associated with finite-difference (FD) procedures. Random matrices leading to acceptable solutions are far more numerous than the unique tridiagonal form in matrix space, which explains why the PINN search typically lands on the random ensemble. The price is a much larger number of parameters, causing lack of physical transparency (explainability) as well as large training costs with no counterpart in the FD procedure.

We reveal a critical reliability crisis: 50-69\\% of correct answers from these models contain fundamentally flawed reasoning -- a ``Right-for-Wrong-Reasons'' phenomenon invisible to standard accuracy metrics. Through analysis of 10,734 reasoning traces across three models and diverse tasks, we introduce the Reasoning Integrity Score (RIS), a process-based metric validated with substantial inter-rater agreement ($\u03ba=0.657$). Conventional practices are challenged by our findings: while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) significantly improves reasoning integrity (Cohen's $d=0.23$--$0.93$), meta-cognitive interventions like self-critique often harm performance ($d=-0.14$ to $-0.33$) in small models on the evaluated tasks.

However, VTL still suffers from modality discrepancies between VIS and TAC images, as well as domain gaps caused by non-standardized tactile sensors and inconsistent data collection procedures. We formulate these challenges as a new task, termed single domain generalization for multimodal VTL (SDG-VTL). In this paper, we propose an OmniVaT framework that, for the first time, successfully addresses this task. On the one hand, OmniVaT integrates a multimodal fractional Fourier adapter (MFFA) to map VIS and TAC embeddings into a unified embedding-frequency space, thereby effectively mitigating the modality gap without multi-domain training data or careful cross-modal fusion strategies. On the other hand, it also incorporates a discrete tree generation (DTG) module that obtains diverse and reliable multimodal fractional representations through a hierarchical tree structure, thereby enhancing its adaptivity to fluctuating domain shifts in unseen domains.

While multimodal data provide complementary information, many existing computational models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, or effective fusion of high-dimensional imaging and tabular clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose the Class-Weighted Sparse-Attention Fusion Network (SAFN), an interpretable deep learning framework for robust multimodal profiling. SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations. A sparsity-constrained attention-gating fusion layer dynamically prioritises informative modalities, while a class-balanced focal loss (beta = 0.999, gamma = 1.5) mitigates dataset imbalance without synthetic oversampling. Evaluated on 703 participants (570 PD, 133 healthy controls) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation, SAFN achieves an accuracy of 0.98 plus or minus 0.02 and a PR-AUC of 1.00 plus or minus 0.00, outperforming established machine learning and deep learning baselines. Interpretability analysis shows a clinically coherent decision process, with approximately 60 percent of predictive weight assigned to clinical assessments, consistent with Movement Disorder Society diagnostic principles.

The pipeline separates damage localization from reconstruction. In the first stage, a 2D convolutional network predicts damage masks on RGB slices extracted from a voxelized object, and these predictions are aggregated into a volumetric mask. In the second stage, a diffusion-based 3D U-Net performs mask-conditioned inpainting directly on voxel grids, reconstructing geometry and color while preserving observed regions. The model jointly predicts occupancy and color using a composite objective that combines occupancy reconstruction with masked color reconstruction and perceptual regularization. We evaluate the approach on a curated set of textured artifacts with synthetically generated damage using standard geometric and color metrics.

Experiments show that lowering the number of hidden LSTM units to 64 maintains the same level of accuracy while also improving it. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranges from 23.6% for the full 128-unit model to 12.4% for the 64-unit model. The optimized model is 73% smaller (from 280KB to 76KB) and 47% more accurate.

This paper introduces a cloud-native architecture using diffusion models to automatically generate store-specific planograms. Unlike conventional optimization methods that reorganize existing layouts, our system learns from successful shelf arrangements across multiple retail locations to create new planogram configurations. The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function.

Existing vision datasets for litter detection focus on street-level still images, aerial scenes or aquatic environments, and do not reflect the unique characteristics of dashcam footage, where litter appears extremely small, sparse and embedded in cluttered road-verge backgrounds. We introduce RoLID-11K, the first large-scale dataset for roadside litter detection from dashcams, comprising over 11k annotated images spanning diverse UK driving conditions and exhibiting pronounced long-tail and small-object distributions. We benchmark a broad spectrum of modern detectors, from accuracy-oriented transformer architectures to real-time YOLO models, and analyse their strengths and limitations on this challenging task. Our results show that while CO-DETR and related transformers achieve the best localisation accuracy, real-time models remain constrained by coarse feature hierarchies. RoLID-11K establishes a challenging benchmark for extreme small-object detection in dynamic driving scenes and aims to support the development of scalable, low-cost systems for roadside-litter monitoring.

In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse.

However, this theory overlooks adversarial samples that do not directly utilize these features. In this work, we advocate that these two kinds of samples - those which use use brittle but predictive features and those that do not - comprise two types of adversarial weaknesses and should be differentiated when evaluating adversarial robustness. For this purpose, we propose an ensemble-based metric to measure the manipulation of non-robust features by adversarial perturbations and use this metric to analyze the makeup of adversarial samples generated by attackers.

In particular, the automatic monitoring of product assembly progress is crucial for improving operational efficiency, minimizing the cost of discarded parts, and maximizing factory productivity. However, in cases where assembly tasks are performed manually over multiple days, implementing smart factory systems remains a challenge. Previous work has proposed Anomaly Triplet-Net, which estimates assembly progress by applying deep metric learning to the visual features of products. Nevertheless, when visual changes between consecutive tasks are subtle, misclassification often occurs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust system for estimating assembly progress, even in cases of occlusion or minimal visual change, using a small-scale dataset.

CPPO addresses this problem by detecting perception tokens via entropy shifts in the model outputs under perturbed input images.

Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions.

Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts.

But extending this task to videos faces unique challenges. Existing approaches primarily focus on frame-wise degradation variation, overlooking the temporal continuity that naturally exists in real-world degradation processes. In practice, degradation types and intensities evolve smoothly over time, and multiple degradations may coexist or transition gradually. In this paper, we introduce the Smoothly Evolving Unknown Degradations (SEUD) scenario, where both the active degradation set and degradation intensity change continuously over time. To support this scenario, we design a flexible synthesis pipeline that generates temporally coherent videos with single, compound, and evolving degradations. To address the challenges in the SEUD scenario, we propose an all-in-One Recurrent Conditional and Adaptive prompting Network (ORCANet). First, a Coarse Intensity Estimation Dehazing (CIED) module estimates haze intensity using physical priors and provides coarse dehazed features as initialization. Second, a Flow Prompt Generation (FPG) module extracts degradation features. FPG generates both static prompts that capture segment-level degradation types and dynamic prompts that adapt to frame-level intensity variations. Furthermore, a label-aware supervision mechanism improves the discriminability of static prompt representations under different degradations. Extensive experiments show that ORCANet achieves superior restoration quality, temporal consistency, and robustness over image and video-based baselines.

Conventional taxi hotspot prediction models often rely solely on historical demand, overlooking dynamic influences such as traffic congestion, road incidents, and public events. This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection.

For \\emph{what to write}, we introduce Spectral-Modulated Glyph Injection (SGMI), which injects a noise-aligned glyph prior with frequency-domain band-pass modulation to strengthen glyph structure and suppress semantic leakage (rendering the concept instead of the word).

Nevertheless, its performance is challenged when dealing with what we refer to as visually non-salient scenarios, where there is low contrast between the foreground and background. In these cases, existing methods often cannot capture accurate contours and fail to produce promising segmentation results. In this paper, we propose Visually Non-Salient SAM (VNS-SAM), aiming to enhance SAM's perception of visually non-salient scenarios while preserving its original zero-shot generalizability. We achieve this by effectively exploiting SAM's low-level features through two designs: Mask-Edge Token Interactive decoder and Non-Salient Feature Mining module. These designs help the SAM decoder gain a deeper understanding of non-salient characteristics with only marginal parameter increments and computational requirements. The additional parameters of VNS-SAM can be optimized within 4 hours, demonstrating its feasibility and practicality. In terms of data, we established VNS-SEG, a unified dataset for various VNS scenarios, with more than 35K images, in contrast to previous single-task adaptations. It is designed to make the model learn more robust VNS features and comprehensively benchmark the model's segmentation performance and generalizability on VNS scenarios. Extensive experiments across various VNS segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VNS-SAM, particularly under zero-shot settings, highlighting its potential for broad real-world applications.

Each item consists of a single-turn prompt, a curated minimal-sufficient baseline answer, and a category label. Our primary metric, YapScore, measures excess response length beyond the baseline in characters, enabling comparisons across models without relying on any specific tokenizer. We summarize model performance via the YapIndex, a uniformly weighted average of category-level median YapScores.\n  YapBench contains over three hundred English prompts spanning three common brevity-ideal settings: (A) minimal or ambiguous inputs where the ideal behavior is a short clarification, (B) closed-form factual questions with short stable answers, and (C) one-line coding tasks where a single command or snippet suffices. Evaluating 76 assistant LLMs, we observe an order-of-magnitude spread in median excess length and distinct category-specific failure modes, including vacuum-filling on ambiguous inputs and explanation or formatting overhead on one-line technical requests.

Most previous methods follow move-and-track framework, in which miss tracking and ambiguous tracking are unavoidable challenging issues. Other methods under different frameworks suffer from various problems like the huge gap between source image and target edited image as well as unreasonable intermediate point which can lead to low editability. To avoid these problems, we propose DynaDrag, the first dragging method under predict-and-move framework. In DynaDrag, Motion Prediction and Motion Supervision are performed iteratively.

To address the challenges of limited space and high costs, irregular geometric transducer arrays that conform to specific imaging regions are promising for achieving high-quality 3D PAI with fewer transducers. However, traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms struggle with irregular array configurations, suffering from high computational complexity, substantial memory requirements, and lengthy reconstruction times. In this work, we introduce SlingBAG Pro, an advanced reconstruction algorithm based on the point cloud iteration concept of the Sliding ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) method, while extending its compatibility to arbitrary array geometries. SlingBAG Pro maintains high reconstruction quality, reduces the number of required transducers, and employs a hierarchical optimization strategy that combines zero-gradient filtering with progressively increased temporal sampling rates during iteration. This strategy rapidly removes redundant spatial point clouds, accelerates convergence, and significantly shortens overall reconstruction time. Compared to the original SlingBAG algorithm, SlingBAG Pro achieves up to a 2.2-fold speed improvement in point cloud-based 3D PA reconstruction under irregular array geometries.

However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAvatar Forcing\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u60c5\u611f\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8868\u8fbe\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u8feb\uff08diffusion forcing\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u5931\u8d25\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8868\u8fbe\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f4e\u81f3500ms\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53476.8\u500d\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7387\u8fbe80%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "Avatar Forcing\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u865a\u62df\u4ea4\u6d41\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u4e92\u52a8\u3002"}}

However, widely used pairwise GRMs create a computational bottleneck when integrated with RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO. By generating a pointwise score for each response, IRPO enables efficient evaluation of arbitrarily many candidates during RL training while preserving interpretability and fine-grained reward signals. Experimental results demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among pointwise GRMs across multiple benchmarks, with performance comparable to that of current leading pairwise GRMs. Furthermore, we show that IRPO significantly outperforms pairwise GRMs in post-training evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "IRPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u70b9\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u6210\u5bf9GRMs\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6210\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728RL\u4e2d\u56e0O(n\u00b2)\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u91cd\u590d\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Bradley-Terry\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f6c\u4e3a\u70b9\u5f0f\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u5019\u9009\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "IRPO\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u70b9\u5f0fGRMs\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u5148\u6210\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u6210\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "IRPO\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662fGRM\u4e0eRL\u878d\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly.

The primary challenge in this setting lies in the mismatch in semantic granularity between textual queries and visual content. Previous studies in ZVMR have attempted to achieve alignment by leveraging high-quality pre-trained knowledge that represents video and language in a joint space. However, these approaches failed to balance the semantic granularity between the pre-trained knowledge provided by each modality for a given scene. As a result, despite the high quality of each modality's representations, the mismatch in granularity led to inaccurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, called Granularity-Aware Alignment (GranAlign), that bridges this gap between coarse and fine semantic representations. Our approach introduces two complementary techniques: granularity-based query rewriting to generate varied semantic granularities, and query-aware caption generation to embed query intent into video content. By pairing multi-level queries with both query-agnostic and query-aware captions, we effectively resolve semantic mismatches.

Safety concerns in T2M methods have been raised in recent years; existing methods replace discrete VQ-VAE codebook entries to steer the model away from unsafe behaviors. However, discrete codebook replacement-based methods have two critical flaws: firstly, replacing codebook entries which are reused by benign prompts leads to drifts on everyday tasks, degrading the model's benign performance; secondly, discrete token-based methods introduce quantization and smoothness loss, resulting in artifacts and jerky transitions. Moreover, existing text-to-motion datasets naturally contain unsafe intents and corresponding motions, making them unsuitable for safety-driven machine learning. To address these challenges, we propose SafeMo, a trustworthy motion generative framework integrating Minimal Motion Unlearning (MMU), a two-stage machine unlearning strategy, enabling safe human motion generation in continuous space, preserving continuous kinematics without codebook loss and delivering strong safety-utility trade-offs compared to current baselines. Additionally, we present the first safe text-to-motion dataset SafeMoVAE-29K integrating rewritten safe text prompts and continuous refined motion for trustworthy human motion unlearning. Built upon DiP, SafeMo efficiently generates safe human motions with natural transitions. Experiments demonstrate effective unlearning performance of SafeMo by showing strengthened forgetting on unsafe prompts, reaching 2.5x and 14.4x higher forget-set FID on HumanML3D and Motion-X respectively, compared to the previous SOTA human motion unlearning method LCR, with benign performance on safe prompts being better or comparable.

This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization.

Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited.

To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games.

In this study, images and corresponding weight data were collected over a 200-day period under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Leveraging powerful pre-trained architectures of ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT), we designed two specialized models: (1) a high-precision binary classifier for sprout detection, and (2) an advanced multi-class predictor to estimate weight loss and forecast remaining shelf-life with remarkable accuracy. DenseNet achieved exceptional performance, with 98.03% accuracy in sprout detection. Shelf-life prediction models performed best with coarse class divisions (2-5 classes), achieving over 89.83% accuracy, while accuracy declined for finer divisions (6-8 classes) due to subtle visual differences and limited data per class. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating image-based models into automated sorting and inventory systems, enabling early identification of sprouted potatoes and dynamic categorization based on storage stage. Practical implications include improved inventory management, differential pricing strategies, and reduced food waste across supply chains. While predicting exact shelf-life intervals remains challenging, focusing on broader class divisions ensures robust performance. Future research should aim to develop generalized models trained on diverse potato varieties and storage conditions to enhance adaptability and scalability.

However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

Spaceborne SAR tomography (TomoSAR) provides weather-independent, side-looking observations that capture facade-level structure, offering a promising alternative to conventional optical methods. However, TomoSAR point clouds often suffer from noise, anisotropic point distributions, and data voids on incoherent surfaces, all of which hinder accurate height reconstruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a learning-based framework for converting raw TomoSAR points into high-resolution building height maps. Our dual-topology network alternates between a point branch that models irregular scatterer features and a grid branch that enforces spatial consistency. By jointly processing these representations, the network denoises the input points and inpaints missing regions to produce continuous height estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of concept for large-scale urban height mapping directly from TomoSAR point clouds. Extensive experiments on data from Munich and Berlin validate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that our framework can be extended to incorporate optical satellite imagery, further enhancing reconstruction quality.

Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur. A common strategy is to build hallucinated models by completely or partially removing visual tokens and contrasting them with the original model. Yet, this alone proves insufficient, since visual information still propagates into generated text. Building on this insight, we propose a novel hallucinated model that captures hallucination effects by selectively removing key text tokens. We further introduce Generalized Contrastive Decoding, which integrates multiple hallucinated models to represent diverse hallucination sources. Together, these ideas form CRoPS, a training-free hallucination mitigation framework that improves CHAIR scores by 20% and achieves consistent gains across six benchmarks and three LVLM families, outperforming state-of-the-art training-free methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCRoPS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5220\u9664\u6587\u672c\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u6765\u6e90\u5047\u8bbe\u72ed\u7a84\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u751f\u6210\u540e\u671f\u6548\u679c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u4ec5\u79fb\u9664\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u963b\u6b62\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5220\u9664\u5173\u952e\u6587\u672c\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5e7f\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5e7b\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "result": "CRoPS\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2aLVLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0cCHAIR\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad820%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CRoPS\u4e3a\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e7b\u89c9\u6291\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u4ee4\u724c\u64cd\u63a7\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We propose FedHypeVAE, a differentially private, hypernetwork-driven framework for synthesizing embedding-level data across decentralized clients. Building on a conditional VAE backbone, we replace the single global decoder and fixed latent prior with client-aware decoders and class-conditional priors generated by a shared hypernetwork from private, trainable client codes. This bi-level design personalizes the generative layerrather than the downstream modelwhile decoupling local data from communicated parameters. The shared hypernetwork is optimized under differential privacy, ensuring that only noise-perturbed, clipped gradients are aggregated across clients. A local MMD alignment between real and synthetic embeddings and a Lipschitz regularizer on hypernetwork outputs further enhance stability and distributional coherence under non-IID conditions. After training, a neutral meta-code enables domain agnostic synthesis, while mixtures of meta-codes provide controllable multi-domain coverage.

Williamson", "Paul Henderson"], "title": "Pixel-to-4D: Camera-Controlled Image-to-Video Generation with Dynamic 3D Gaussians", "comment": null, "summary": "Humans excel at forecasting the future dynamics of a scene given just a single image. Video generation models that can mimic this ability are an essential component for intelligent systems. Recent approaches have improved temporal coherence and 3D consistency in single-image-conditioned video generation. However, these methods often lack robust user controllability, such as modifying the camera path, limiting their applicability in real-world applications. Most existing camera-controlled image-to-video models struggle with accurately modeling camera motion, maintaining temporal consistency, and preserving geometric integrity. Leveraging explicit intermediate 3D representations offers a promising solution by enabling coherent video generation aligned with a given camera trajectory. Although these methods often use 3D point clouds to render scenes and introduce object motion in a later stage, this two-step process still falls short in achieving full temporal consistency, despite allowing precise control over camera movement. We propose a novel framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian scene representation and samples plausible object motion, given a single image in a single forward pass. This enables fast, camera-guided video generation without the need for iterative denoising to inject object motion into render frames. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, Waymo, RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art video quality and inference efficiency.

By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures.

To be published at WVAQ Workshop at WACV", "summary": "In digital imaging, image demosaicing is a crucial first step which recovers the RGB information from a color filter array (CFA). Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u63d0\u5347 isotropic \u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86 JD3Net \u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4fc3\u4f7f\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f20\u7edf\u53bb\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u907f\u514d\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e DeepMAD \u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5e26\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5168\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7f51\u7edc JD3Net \u5728\u53bb\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u53bb\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u53bb\u566a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a isotropic \u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u53bb\u9a6c\u8d5b\u514b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, after deployment, their performance may deteriorate when the input data distribution shifts from that observed during development. Detecting such performance degradation is essential for clinical reliability, yet remains challenging for large pre-trained VLMs operating without labeled data. In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift.

We present an end-to-end workflow for grading scanned handwritten engineering quizzes with multimodal large language models (LLMs) that preserves the standard exam process (A4 paper, unconstrained student handwriting). The lecturer provides only a handwritten reference solution (100%) and a short set of grading rules; the reference is converted into a text-only summary that conditions grading without exposing the reference scan. Reliability is achieved through a multi-stage design with a format/presence check to prevent grading blank answers, an ensemble of independent graders, supervisor aggregation, and rigid templates with deterministic validation to produce auditable, machine-parseable reports.

In this work, we propose two novel deep learning architectures called LNU-Net and IBU-Net for left ventricle segmentation from short-axis cine MRI images.

The architectures of LNU-Net and IBU-Net have a down-sampling path for feature extraction and an up-sampling path for precise localization. We use the original U-Net as the basic segmentation approach and compared it with our proposed architectures. Both LNU-Net and IBU-Net have left ventricle segmentation methods: LNU-Net applies layer normalization in each convolutional block, while IBU-Net incorporates instance and batch normalization together in the first convolutional block and passes its result to the next layer. Our method incorporates affine transformations and elastic deformations for image data processing.

Instead of following the prevailing cascade, we rethink how primitives and points should interact, and find it more effective to decode primitives in a dedicated pathway that attends to shared shape features. Following this principle, we present UniCo, which in a single feed-forward pass predicts a set of primitives with complete geometry, semantics, and inlier membership. To drive this unified representation, we introduce primitive proxies, learnable queries that are contextualized to produce assembly-ready outputs. To ensure consistent optimization, our training strategy couples primitives and points with online target updates. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks with four independent assembly solvers, UniCo consistently outperforms recent baselines, lowering Chamfer distance by up to 50% and improving normal consistency by up to 7%.

Existing methods using single Gaussian primitives are limited by their low-pass filtering nature, while standard Gabor functions introduce energy instability. Moreover, lack of temporal continuity constraints often leads to motion artifacts during interpolation. We propose AdaGaR, a unified framework addressing both frequency adaptivity and temporal continuity in explicit dynamic scene modeling. We introduce Adaptive Gabor Representation, extending Gaussians through learnable frequency weights and adaptive energy compensation to balance detail capture and stability. For temporal continuity, we employ Cubic Hermite Splines with Temporal Curvature Regularization to ensure smooth motion evolution. An Adaptive Initialization mechanism combining depth estimation, point tracking, and foreground masks establishes stable point cloud distributions in early training. Experiments on Tap-Vid DAVIS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (PSNR 35.49, SSIM 0.9433, LPIPS 0.0723) and strong generalization across frame interpolation, depth consistency, video editing, and stereo view synthesis.
