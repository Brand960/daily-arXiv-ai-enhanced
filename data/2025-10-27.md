TL;DR: 通过在训练时引入辅助模块承载干扰因素，使适配器只学习目标属性，提升生成质量与提示一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统适配器因输入图像包含混杂因素而出现属性纠缠，导致泛化性差和提示偏离

Method: Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training：训练时用ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块承接姿势、光照等干扰因素，适配器仅学习目标身份；推理时移除辅助模块

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入任务中显著提升生成质量、多样性和提示遵循性

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，要获得解耦表示，最有效的方法可能是为‘不应学习’的内容显式建立捷径

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

### [2] [Video-As-Prompt: Unified Semantic Control for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20888)
*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAP提出一种新的视频生成范式，使用参考视频作为语义提示，实现通用、无工件的语义控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因强制不合适的像素级先验或依赖特定条件微调而产生伪影，缺乏通用性

Method: 引入Video-As-Prompt（VAP），利用冻结的Video DiT结合可插拔的MoT专家，通过时间偏差位置嵌入实现上下文检索

Result: 在VAP-Data（超10万配对视频）上达到38.7%用户偏好率，开源SOTA，零样本泛化强劲

Conclusion: VAP为通用可控视频生成提供了统一框架，显著推动该领域发展

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

### [3] [Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20933)
*Moin Safdar,Shahzaib Iqbal,Mehwish Mehmood,Mubeen Ghafoor,Tariq M. Khan,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-BFF-Net，融合CNN与Transformer，通过焦点调制和双向特征融合提升医学图像分割精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN局部感受野难以捕捉全局上下文和长程依赖，影响复杂边界和多尺度结构的分割效果

Method: 提出FM-BFF-Net，结合卷积与Transformer，引入焦点调制注意力机制和双向特征融合模块，增强跨尺度特征交互

Result: 在8个公开医学数据集上，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上均超越现有SOTA方法

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net能有效提升分割边界精度与对病灶尺寸、形状、对比度变化的鲁棒性，适用于多样医学影像场景

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

### [4] [Generative Point Tracking with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20951)
*Mattie Tesfaldet,Adam W. Harley,Konstantinos G. Derpanis,Derek Nowrouzezahrai,Christopher Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出生成式点跟踪模型GenPT，通过流动匹配捕捉多模态轨迹，显著提升遮挡场景下的跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别模型在不确定性下仅回归均值或众数，无法捕捉轨迹的多模态特性，导致遮挡场景性能受限。

Method: GenPT采用流动匹配框架，融合判别跟踪的迭代优化、窗口依赖先验和点坐标专用方差调度，并通过最佳优先搜索利用生成样本提升推理精度。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准上达到SOTA，尤其在新增遮挡的TAP-Vid变体上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GenPT成功建模轨迹多模态性，在保持可见点跟踪性能的同时，大幅提升遮挡点跟踪精度。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

### [5] [3DReasonKnee: Advancing Grounded Reasoning in Medical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20967)
*Sraavya Sambara,Sung Eun Kim,Xiaoman Zhang,Luyang Luo,Shreya Johri,Mohammed Baharoon,Du Hyun Ro,Pranav Rajpurkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个3D医学图像-grounded推理数据集3DReasonKnee，支持解剖区域定位与临床推理，助力AI与医生协同诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型无法在3D医学图像中精准定位解剖区域并进行逐步临床推理，影响其在真实诊断流程中的可信应用。

Method: 构建3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970例膝关节MRI，生成49.4万组五元组，涵盖3D体积、诊断问题、3D标注框、医生推理链和严重度评估，由专家耗时450+小时标注验证。

Result: 建立ReasonKnee-Bench评估基准，测试5个SOTA视觉语言模型，提供基线性能，验证模型在3D定位与诊断推理上的能力。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为首个含专家推理路径的3D医学推理数据集，为推进面向临床的多模态AI系统提供关键资源与评测标准。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受光照和材料特性影响，难以重建透明、半透明及异质物体的精细形状。

Method: 建立热偏振观测的一般理论，利用多视角长波红外偏振图像进行3D形状恢复。

Result: 在透明、半透明和异质物体上实现高精度细节重建，性能超越现有技术。

Conclusion: 热偏振成像可消除可见光偏振的歧义性，为复杂材质的3D重建提供新途径。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

### [7] [VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for Visual Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20994)
*Jesimon Barreto,Carlos Caetano,André Araujo,William Robson Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VESSA方法，通过无需标注的多视角物体中心视频实现视觉基础模型的自监督微调，显著提升在分布偏移和标签稀缺场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺场景下依赖监督微调效果差，而自监督适应在视觉编码器上效果不佳，亟需新的无监督适应方法。

Method: VESSA提出基于自蒸馏的自监督微调框架，利用物体中心视频的多视角观测，结合参数高效适配与预测头优化，避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上，VESSA在下游分类任务中一致超越基线模型和先前适应方法。

Conclusion: VESSA证明了仅用无标注多视角视频即可有效适配视觉基础模型，为低标注场景提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于基础模型的插件式2D检测管道，提升工业环境下未知物体的检测精度，从而改善6D位姿估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流水线在杂乱、低光和复杂背景条件下检测性能下降，检测成为主要瓶颈。

Method: 通过低光图像增强和基于基础模型的开放词汇检测引导的背景去除，抑制SAM输出的误检，提升检测可靠性。

Result: 在BOP工业拾取基准上显著提升检测精度，且推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效且实用，为工业场景中的未知物体6D位姿估计提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

*Abdullah Turer,Yongsheng Bai,Halil Sezen,Alper Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用深度学习方法基于地震后图像自动检测混凝土结构中裸露钢筋，实现快速损伤评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地震后快速评估结构完整性对公共安全和应急响应至关重要，传统人工检查效率低，需自动化方法。

Method: 构建基于2023年土耳其地震图像的新数据集，采用YOLOv11模型检测裂缝与剥落，微调YOLO模型分类损伤等级，结合分类框架形成混合深度学习系统。

Result: 成功实现对建筑物内外结构组件的自动分类及损伤等级识别，模型在多样化损伤场景下表现可靠。

Conclusion: 图像数据结合深度学习可有效实现灾害后结构损伤的快速自动化检测，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

*Pranav Saxena,Jimmy Chiun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZING-3D提出了一种无需任务特定训练的零样本3D场景图生成框架，结合视觉语言模型与深度信息，实现开放词汇识别、3D几何定位和增量更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法局限于单视图、无法增量更新、缺乏明确的3D几何约束，难以满足具身智能需求。

Method: 利用预训练VLM生成2D场景图，通过深度信息将其几何定位到3D空间，节点包含对象、3D位置和语义特征，边表示空间与语义关系及距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上验证了ZING-3D在无任务训练下有效捕捉空间与关系知识。

Conclusion: ZING-3D为机器人应用提供了无需微调、支持增量与3D接地的开放词汇场景理解方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

*Guoan Xu,Yang Xiao,Wenjing Jia,Guangwei Gao,Guo-Jun Qi,Chia-Wen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出WaveSeg解码器，结合小波域频率先验与Mamba注意力，提升语义分割的边界细节与语义完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义分割网络依赖强大编码器但解码器简单，导致语义上下文与细节保留之间的权衡不佳。

Method: WaveSeg联合优化空间域与小波域特征细化，引入高频频率先验、Dual Domain Operation (DDO)、Spectrum Decomposition Attention (SDA) 和重参数化卷积，最后通过残差引导融合输出高分辨率特征图。

Result: 在标准基准上显著超越现有SOTA方法，实现更精确高效的分割。

Conclusion: 小波域频率先验与Mamba注意力结合能有效提升分割精度与结构细节保留。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型作为黑箱缺乏临床可解释性，无法模拟医生决策过程。

Method: 利用大语言模型生成专家文本提示，通过QuiltNet编码并与视觉特征对齐，构建基于对比语言-图像预训练的多模态模型。

Result: 模型准确率83.9%、精确率86.6%、特异性87.6%，全面优于VGG-19、ResNet-18和ResNet-50。

Conclusion: 多模态学习融合专家知识可提升组织病理学分析的临床相关性与可解释性。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于直方图的Retinex模型HistRetinex，显著加速低光图像增强并提升效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于空域的Retinex方法处理大图像耗时高，亟需高效算法

Method: 将Retinex模型扩展至直方图域，定义直方图位置矩阵与计数矩阵，构建两级优化模型，通过迭代求解照明与反射率直方图，最终通过直方图匹配增强图像

Result: HistRetinex在可见性和评价指标上优于现有方法，处理1000×664图像仅需1.86秒，最少节省6.67秒

Conclusion: 直方图域Retinex模型有效实现高速高质低光增强，具有实用价值

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出主动视觉推理（AVR）任务与CLEVR-AVR基准，构建AVR-152k数据集和PhysVLM-AVR模型，提升多模态大模型在部分可观测环境中的主动推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大模型仅能在静态、完全可观测场景中进行视觉推理，难以应对真实世界中信息不全的问题；人类则通过主动探索交互获取信息，因此需赋予模型主动推理能力。

Method: 设计AVR任务，构建CLEVR-AVR仿真基准和AVR-152k数据集（含Chain-of-Thought标注），提出PhysVLM-AVR模型，支持序贯动作、多步推理与动态决策。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是提升MLLM真实环境适应性的关键方向，未来需强化模型的交互式信息获取与长期推理能力。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出一种面向对象、感知不确定性的城市级LiDAR变化检测方法，显著提升精度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度和视角不匹配敏感，且缺乏对象身份和不确定性建模；现有神经模型内存消耗大、对预对齐要求高、难以处理分裂/合并问题。

Method: 采用多分辨率NDT与点到平面ICP对齐，结合高度归一化和局部检测水平校准；通过几何-语义联合关联与类约束二分匹配处理分裂/合并，使用分块处理降低内存，融合3D重叠、法向位移、高程与体积差异进行实例级决策。

Result: 在15个Subiaco街区达到95.2%准确率、90.4% mF1和82.6% mIoU，优于Triplet KPConv，尤其在“减少”类上mIoU提升7.6个百分点至74.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决传统方法的局限性，在保持内存效率的同时实现高精度、类一致且鲁棒的城市尺度LiDAR变化检测。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE通过动态先验机制有效平衡了模型性能与微调效率，为大模型高效适配提供新范式。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

Method: 利用图像编辑模型生成反事实图像对，仅修改影响安全标签的细微特征，构建涵盖9类安全主题的3020+图像对基准

Result: 构建首个系统性精细图像安全评估基准，揭示视觉-语言模型在细微差异判断上的弱点，并提升轻量级安全模型的训练样本效率

Conclusion: SafetyPairs为细粒度图像安全研究提供了首个系统性资源，兼具评估与数据增强双重价值

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

Motivation: 现有RL框架在提升多模态大模型通用CoT推理时泛化能力差，难以超出训练分布。

Method: 1. 注入高斯噪声的视觉探索策略；2. 将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推断问题，利用噪声水平作为先验、轨迹奖励作为似然。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过噪声驱动探索与贝叶斯优势建模，有效增强多模态大模型的推理泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTPA依赖碘对比剂，存在肾毒性和过敏风险，尤其对高危患者不友好，亟需无对比剂替代方案。

Method: 使用级联CycleGAN模型，从无对比剂CT（NCCT）生成数字对比剂CTPA（DCCTPA），在410对扫描数据上训练与验证。

Result: DCCTPA在定量指标（MAE、PSNR、SSIM）和视觉质量上优于SOTA方法；肺血管分割Dice达0.70-0.73，血管体积ICC达0.81，显著优于NCCT。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成高质量DCCTPA，实现接近真实CTPA的血管增强效果，可作为无对比剂诊断的可靠替代方案。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

Motivation: 现有方法用文本提示和VQA评分代理视觉空间智能（VSI），忽视几何结构、易受语言捷径影响，无法真实评估空间能力。

Method: 引入SIG——一种基于网格的结构化表征，编码物体布局、关系和物理先验；基于SIG设计评估指标，分离空间能力与语言偏见；在多模态LLM中进行少样本上下文学习验证。

Result: SIG在所有VSI指标上显著优于VQA-only方法，表现更稳定、全面；发布SIGBench基准，含1.4K驾驶帧带真值SIG标签和人眼注视数据。

Conclusion: SIG是学习与评估视觉空间智能的有效数据标注与训练框架，为自动驾驶等场景提供更真实的空间推理能力评估手段。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的信号特征，且推理成本高

Method: 将生成轨迹划分为多个时间片段，每个片段由专用的小型速度块建模；引入语义特征引导模块和轻量级特征残差近似策略

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上显著优于现有方法，推理加速2.1-4.9倍，生成质量相当

Conclusion: BFM通过分块建模与语义引导有效提升生成效率与质量，为Flow Matching提供了新的高效范式

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

Method: TokenCLIP将视觉token动态分配到正交文本子空间组合，借助最优运输问题实现语义相似性引导的自适应对齐，并通过top-k掩码稀疏化分配

Result: 在未见对象异常检测任务上显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 动态文本子空间对齐能有效提升零样本异常检测的细粒度建模能力

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

Result: KBE有效缓解数据污染与饱和，实现可调控难度的全面评估

Conclusion: KBE为多模态大模型提供了更可靠、动态且可扩展的评估新范式

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Conclusion: MATrack为夜间搜救、边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供了高效、稳定的夜间无人机跟踪解决方案。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

Conclusion: iSM使快捷模型成为可行且有竞争力的生成模型

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

TL;DR: TSSR是一种基于离散扩散模型的并行3D网格生成方法，能高效生成高分辨率、艺术家风格的复杂网格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服自回归方法的序列生成瓶颈，实现并行生成并提升token预测精度。

Method: 采用解耦训练与混合推理、改进的雾霾架构（含RoPE位置编码）和新型连接损失函数，分别优化拓扑与形状生成。

Result: 在复杂数据集上生成高达10,000面片、分辨率达1024³的高质量艺术风格3D网格。

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成与拓扑约束显著提升3D网格质量，为艺术风格建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

Method: 引入对象中心语义 grounding 与物理感知执行联合，构建SAGE-3D框架，并发布InteriorGS数据集与SAGE-Bench基准

Result: 在VLN-CE Unseen任务上基线性能提升31%，3DGS数据收敛更难但泛化性强

Conclusion: SAGE-3D为3DGS注入语义与物理能力，显著推动其在导航任务中的实用性与通用性

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

TL;DR: 提出FineRS框架，通过两阶段强化学习提升MLLM在高分辨率图像中细小物体的定位与分割性能

Motivation: 现有MLLM因输入分辨率受限，难以精确理解高分辨率图像中的极小物体，尤其在复杂背景中

Method: 采用粗到细两阶段框架：Global Semantic Exploration（GSE）生成文本响应与粗略区域，Localized Perceptual Refinement（LPR）精化为精确边界框和分割掩码，并引入定位引导的回顾奖励耦合两阶段

Result: 在新构建的FineRS-4k数据集及公开数据集上，性能显著优于现有MLLM方法，兼顾指令引导分割与视觉推理

Conclusion: FineRS有效解决了高分辨率下细小物体的细粒度理解问题，为MLLM的视觉细节建模提供了新思路

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 视觉-语言表示对齐的可解释性不足，因难以将多模态表示映射到统一概念集。

Method: 设计VL-SAE，使用基于距离的编码器和模态特异性解码器，通过余弦相似性对齐表示，并鼓励语义相似表示在隐藏层中具有一致的神经元激活。

Conclusion: VL-SAE为视觉-语言对齐提供了可解释且可增强的框架，推动多模态模型的透明化与性能优化。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

Motivation: 现有计算模型局限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞在扰动下的复杂三维形态变化，制约了虚拟细胞模型的准确性。

Method: FORM 包含一个多通道VQGAN形态编码器和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块，基于65,000+个三维细胞体积数据集训练，支持无条件生成与条件模拟。

Result: FORM 能预测下游信号、模拟组合扰动、推断未见扰动的形态动态，并通过新基准MorphoEval在结构、统计和生物学维度上验证性能。

Conclusion: FORM 与 MorphoEval 共同推动高分辨率三维虚拟细胞模型的发展，实现了形态、扰动与功能之间的关联预测。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Motivation: 传统多尺度特征融合方法忽视局部与全局特征关系，且易受复杂背景干扰，难以应对苹果叶病表型异质性和少样本识别挑战。

Method: 采用CNN提取局部病斑细节，Vision Transformer捕捉全局结构，引入自适应特征融合模块（AFFM）动态融合，并利用预训练CLIP实现视觉与语义文本对齐。

Result: 在公开与自建数据集上分别达到97.38%和96.12%的准确率，优于多种基线方法。

Conclusion: CT-CLIP有效解决病害形态多样性与复杂环境干扰问题，为农业智能识别提供高效实用方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Result: 在多个无人机跟踪数据集上取得有竞争力的性能，且提供多种模型变体以适配不同计算资源。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效提升了无人机跟踪的语义感知能力与实际部署灵活性。

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Motivation: 眼动信号能有效反映注意力与意图，但现有方法多依赖视觉输入或在推理时使用眼动，未充分挖掘其训练时的潜力。

Method: 引入 gaze-regularized 注意力机制，在训练阶段对齐模型注意力与人类眼动，模块化设计可适配多种 VLM 架构。

Result: 未来事件预测提升最高11分，当前活动理解提升约7分，显著优于无眼动正则化基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为利用人类眼动提升 VLM 在实际场景（如辅助机器人）中的预测能力奠定基础。

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

Motivation: 解决合成CT生成中注册偏差导致的性能虚高问题，提升模型解剖一致性与泛化能力。

Method: 采用2.5D U-Net++（ResNet-34编码器），联合训练多解剖区域，使用L1+IMPACT-Synth感知损失，结合IMPACT和Elastix两种注册策略，测试时增强与五折集成。

Result: IMPACT注册在本地测试集上降低MAE、提升结构真实性；但在公测集上Elastix表现更好，揭示注册偏差对评估的干扰。

Conclusion: 注册策略直接影响模型性能评估，IMPACT有助于缓解偏差，促进更鲁棒、解剖一致的sCT生成模型发展。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

Result: 相比朴素早期停止，显著提升带宽适应生成的视觉保真度

Conclusion: 该方法仅需微小架构改动，为带宽受限环境下的高效图像传输提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Conclusion: TerraGen为遥感多任务学习提供了统一、高效的生成式数据增强新范式，推动地理空间信息与视觉任务的深度融合。

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: 深度一致性约束与软缝扩散机制可显著提升复杂场景下的图像拼接性能，且计算高效。

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is

TL;DR: ArtiLatent是一种生成框架，通过联合建模部件几何与关节动力学，实现高保真可动3D物体的合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时生成具有精细几何、准确关节和真实外观的可动3D物体，尤其在关节变化时出现纹理失真和结构不一致问题。

Method: 采用变分自编码器将稀疏体素几何与关节属性编码至统一潜在空间，结合潜在扩散模型进行采样，并提出关节感知高斯解码器，根据关节状态动态分配纹理。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility和ACD数据集上，ArtiLatent在几何一致性与外观保真度上超越现有方法，能自然还原隐藏区域的纹理。

Conclusion: ArtiLatent为可动3D物体的生成与操控提供了可扩展、高真实感的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出各向异性池化方法替代平均池化，提升LUT实现CNN图像恢复的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT-CNN方法使用平均池化融合不同方向的像素块，但不适用于各向异性信号结构，限制了性能

Method: 引入广义中值池化，并进一步学习数据依赖的各向异性池化系数，自适应加权不同方向的像素块

Result: 在多个图像恢复基准上，方法在感知和数值指标上均优于现有LUT-CNN方法

Conclusion: 各向异性池化能有效提升LUT-CNN的恢复质量，为高效图像恢复提供新思路

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么推理代价高，要么依赖预定义离散层级，难以适应真实世界复杂结构

Method: 提出OpenHype，利用双曲几何的连续潜在空间编码多尺度层次关系，并通过测地线实现层次遍历

Result: 在标准基准上超越现有方法，展现出更高的效率和更强的适应性

Conclusion: 双曲空间为隐式表示中的层次建模提供了新范式，适用于自治代理的3D场景理解

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线视频异常检测因实时性和计算开销限制研究较少，而离线方法受益于大模型进展，亟需一种无需训练的高效在线解决方案

Method: MoniTor通过流式输入驱动预训练VLM，引入类LSTM预测机制建模时序依赖，并设计得分队列与异常先验动态存储历史评分，指导大模型时序异常判别

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence数据集上超越现有SOTA方法，性能媲美弱监督训练方法且无需训练

Conclusion: MoniTor首次实现高效无训练在线VAD，证明大模型在实时异常检测中潜力，为未来在线视频理解提供新范式

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

TL;DR: VidSplice通过解耦视频修复为图像修复和运动传播两步，引入空帧先验和协同传播机制，显著提升视频修复的时空一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在严重内容退化下难以保证时空稳定性，尤其对视频后半部分控制不足。

Method: 提出VidSplice框架，包含CoSpliced模块实现首帧传播与拼接，以及上下文控制器编码先验并注入I2V生成骨干。

Result: 在多种视频修复场景中表现优异，显著提升前景对齐与运动稳定性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 解耦策略与空帧先验有效增强视频修复的时空一致性，为复杂场景提供更可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: CXR-LanIC是一种新型可解释性框架，通过任务对齐的模式发现，在保持高诊断准确率的同时提供临床可验证的视觉模式解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在胸片诊断中准确率高，但黑箱特性阻碍临床信任，需透明、可验证的解释来识别模型失效模式。

Method: 基于BiomedCLIP诊断分类器训练100个transcoder稀疏自编码器，从MIMIC-CXR的多模态嵌入中提取约5000个单语义视觉模式，每个模式对应特定放射学特征，预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式并配以激活图库。

Result: 在五项关键诊断任务上达到竞争性准确率，发现的模式覆盖心脏、肺、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影类别，支持自然语言解释生成。

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC通过从诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征，实现了高精度与高可解释性的统一，推动医疗AI的临床安全部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理基础模型忽视细胞级特征建模，限制了癌症亚型分类等细粒度任务的性能。

Method: 双流架构 + 受容加权键值聚合模型 + 双向组织-细胞交互模块，实现线性复杂度的细胞依赖建模与双向注意力机制。

Result: 在四个病理亚型分类基准上超越现有模型，验证细胞聚合与组织-细胞交互的重要性。

Conclusion: 细胞级特征与组织环境的协同建模对细粒度计算病理至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly
available.

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in
precision-recall curves, confidence scores, and occlusion scenarios. Combining
high accuracy with real-time processing, this model provides a reliable
solution for computer-aided diagnosis of placental abruption, holding
significant clinical application value.

Conclusion: 细粒度区域感知与语义对齐是提升MLLM视觉能力的关键，GranViT为未来视觉编码器设计提供新范式。

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

TL;DR: 提出Foresight Guidance（FSG），通过多步长迭代改进Classifier-Free Guidance，提升生成质量与效率


<details>

Motivation: 现有CFG方法理论分歧大，设计空间受限，且单步迭代效率低

Method: 将条件引导重新定义为不动点迭代，提出FSG在早期扩散阶段求解长区间子问题，增加迭代次数

Result: 在多样数据集和模型上，FSG在图像质量和计算效率上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: FSG提供了条件引导的新视角，激活了自适应设计的潜力

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

Conclusion: 注意力层具有可解释且可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单有效的方法。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

Conclusion: Foley Control为视频驱动音效生成提供高效、模块化、可扩展的解决方案，框架可推广至其他音频模态。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

Motivation: 现有GRPO存在优势分配不准确和忽视生成时间动态的问题

Method: 将优化粒度从步级提升为块级（chunk），将连续步骤聚合成具有时间一致性的块，并引入加权采样策略

Result: 在偏好对齐和图像质量上显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: 块级优化为GRPO类方法提供了更有效的新范式

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

TL;DR: TIGER提出一种文本优先的超分辨率框架，突破图像质量与文本可读性的权衡，实现同时提升两者性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本，导致图像质量与文本可读性之间存在根本性权衡。

Method: TIGER采用两阶段“文本优先、图像后续”范式，先重建文本字形结构，再利用其引导全图超分辨率，实现字形与图像的协同优化。

Result: 提出首个极端放大（×14.29）场景文本数据集UltraZoom-ST，实验表明TIGER在文本可读性与图像质量上均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: TIGER通过解耦文本与图像重建过程，有效解决了超分辨率中的文本失真问题，为图文联合增强提供了新范式。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用深度学习模型在仅有单专家标注的MEG数据中自动检测间歇性尖波，提出CNN和ANN模型，性能超越现有方法，并引入交互式机器学习提升标注质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动检测MEG中的间歇性尖波费时且准确率低，现有自动化方法依赖大量标注数据或在非典型数据上鲁棒性差，难以应用于临床。

Method: 提出CNN和ANN两种模型，在59例患者数据上训练，结合交互式机器学习迭代优化标注质量，使用10例留存患者数据验证性能。

Result: CNN和ANN模型F1分数分别为0.46和0.44，优于现有最先进模型；交互式学习证明模型对标注噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的深度学习模型在复杂且标注不完美数据中表现 robust，交互式学习显著提升标注效率，为临床自动化检测提供实用工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过大规模合成数据和模糊感知架构，显著提升显著性目标检测的泛化能力，仅用合成数据训练即可减少20-50%误差，并在DIS和HR-SOD上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著性目标检测依赖昂贵的像素级标注，导致不同子任务（如DIS和HR-SOD）需独立训练，泛化能力差。

Method: 提出S3OD数据集（13.9万张高分辨率图），通过多模态扩散管道与DINO-v3特征自动生成标签，并用迭代框架聚焦难样本；设计多掩码解码器，自然处理检测中的模糊性。

Result: 仅用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化上误差减少20-50%，微调后在DIS和HR-SOD上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 合成数据+模糊感知架构可有效突破标注瓶颈，实现高效通用的显著性检测。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Modest-Align，一种轻量级跨模态对齐框架，在数据稀缺时显著提升鲁棒性，仅需CLIP万分之一数据和千分之一算力即可超越SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在低质量或稀疏数据下易因模糊匹配导致过自信，性能下降。

Method: 引入随机扰动模拟不确定性，并通过嵌入平滑校准相似度分布，联合提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上超越SOTA，仅用CLIP 1/100数据和1/600算力达到竞争力结果。

Conclusion: Modest-Align为资源受限场景下的跨模态对齐提供了高效、实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

TL;DR: 通过引入对极几何约束，提升视频扩散模型的几何一致性与运动稳定性，无需端到端可微分即可实现高质量视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影方面表现不佳，难以实现真正的3D一致性。

Method: 利用成对对极几何约束，通过基于偏好的优化方法对扩散模型进行几何对齐，无需端到端可微分。

Result: 模型在静态场景训练后能泛化至动态内容，几何稳定性显著提升，优于现代学习型指标。

Conclusion: 结合数据驱动深度学习与经典几何视觉，提出一种实用且高质量的3D一致视频生成方法。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

TL;DR: 提出DAP-MAE，通过域自适应机制提升跨域点云自监督预训练效果，在多个3D任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域点云数据量有限，现有混合域预训练方法因领域知识不匹配导致下游任务性能下降。

Method: 设计域自适应点云掩码自编码器（DAP-MAE），包含异构域适配器（预训练适应模式+微调融合模式）和域特征生成器，实现跨域知识自适应整合。

Result: 仅需一次预训练，在ScanObjectNN分类达95.18%，Bosphorus表情识别达88.45%，在四个点云任务上均表现卓越。

Conclusion: DAP-MAE有效解决了跨域预训练的领域不匹配问题，显著提升点云分析任务的泛化性和性能。

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

TL;DR: 提出Gompertz-CNN动态知识蒸馏框架，基于Gompertz生长曲线动态调整蒸馏损失，提升学生模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉学生模型认知能力的动态变化，导致知识迁移不充分

Method: 引入Gompertz生长曲线动态调节蒸馏损失权重，结合Wasserstein距离和梯度匹配，构建多损失联合优化目标

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上相比传统方法分别提升8%和4%准确率

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN有效建模学生学习过程，显著提升知识蒸馏效率与性能

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Result: 提出GIP-DB首个IMU+UWB双人数据集，在合成与真实数据中超越现有方法

Conclusion: IMU+UWB融合方法在无环境依赖场景下实现高精度多人运动捕捉，具有广泛应用前景

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human
motion capture in the wild. Code, models, dataset:

Motivation: NACTI数据集存在严重长尾类不平衡，传统方法性能受限，亟需系统研究长尾识别技术在野生动物图像识别中的应用。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统评估多种长尾损失函数与正则化方法，优化调度策略，并构建Reduced-Bias Test集评估域外泛化。

Result: 最优配置达到99.40% Top-1准确率，超越基线（95.51%）和MLWIC2先前最优（96.8%）；在跨域测试中达到52.55%准确率，优于WCE损失的51.20%。

Conclusion: 长尾增强方法显著提升性能，尤其在联合最优损失与调度器时效果突出，但仍无法完全解决尾部类别在严重域偏移下的崩溃问题。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North
America Camera Trap Images (NACTI) dataset shows severe long-tailed class
imbalance, noting that the largest 'Head' class alone covers >50% of the 3.7M
images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

Motivation: 传统监督方法需人工标注样本，而本研究希望避免先验标签，自动发现突触类型。

Method: 利用邻近突触在同神经元内更相似的假设，通过无监督聚类方法对突触进行分类。

Result: 成功应用于果蝇数据，无需预设类别数即可有效分离突触类型。

Conclusion: 该方法为突触结构分类提供了无需先验标签的 principled 解决方案，有利于发现多样化的突触结构。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

Motivation: 皮肤病理全切片图像（WSI）生成速度加快，亟需自动化方法实现高效准确分类。

Method: 采用UNI和Virchow2提取patch级嵌入，使用均值聚合生成slide级特征，结合逻辑回归、梯度提升树和随机森林分类器，评估精确率、召回率、AUROC等指标，并探索数据增强与图像归一化策略。

Conclusion: 基础模型在皮肤病理WSI分类中具有应用潜力，为自动化诊断提供了可扩展、高效的解决方案，并推动slide级表征学习的未来发展。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

Conclusion: WorldGrow为构建大规模虚拟环境和未来世界模型提供了新范式，具备强大的可扩展性与真实感生成能力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

Result: 无需额外训练，BachVid在生成多视频时实现前景与背景的 robust 一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种高效、无训练、无参考图像的统一一致性视频生成新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

TL;DR: CESAR通过奖励推理过程而非结果，解决音频大模型在推理时性能下降的问题，实现推理性能提升并达到近人水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频大模型在推理时出现测试时逆扩展现象，即推理链越长性能越差，传统方法仅验证输出结果不足以改善这一问题。

Method: 提出CESAR框架，采用在线强化学习与组相对策略优化，设计多维度奖励机制，鼓励推理的一致性、结构性、因果性、领域知识整合与合理深度。

Result: 在MMAU Test-mini上超越Gemini 2.5 Pro和GPT-4o Audio，MMSU任务近人类水平，同时提升多模态感知与推理能力。

Conclusion: CESAR为音频大模型建立了一种系统性、可扩展的推理优化方法，证明推理过程本身可成为性能提升的核心驱动力。

Abstract: The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely
underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than
improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse
scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We
demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning
itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the
reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that
accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we
introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting
from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online
reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization
with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and
format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning,
domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves
test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains
while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots", where performance
peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU
Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and
near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge
evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and
qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced
reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal
reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled
method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于固定拓扑的图方法无法适应不同危机机制（如信贷传染、疫情、通胀）下的动态相关性变化，导致资产配置失效。

Method: 采用GCN编码空间关系，BiLSTM+自注意力建模时间动态，结合多头图注意力机制自动学习稀疏且危机敏感的资产关联结构，过滤92.5%噪声连接。

Result: 在2005–2021数据训练后，CRISP在2022–2024通胀危机中表现优异，夏普比率3.76，较等权基线提升707%，较静态图方法提升94%；注意力权重可解释地识别危机 regimes。

Conclusion: CRISP通过学习而非假设的方式自适应捕获危机相关性，实现鲁棒的资产配置，为金融预测提供可解释、高容错的新范式。

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting faces a fundamental challenge: predicting
optimal asset allocations requires understanding regime-dependent correlation
structures that transform during crisis periods. Existing graph-based
spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph
topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt
when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit
contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs.
  We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal
Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes
spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics
via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through
multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP
discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms,
filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant
dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions.
  Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP
demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a
fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate
correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that
maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707%
improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph
methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with
defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31%
market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing
assumptions.

Conclusion: MOBO-OSD通过正交搜索方向与前沿估计有效提升了多目标优化的效率与质量，是处理昂贵黑盒多目标问题的强有力工具。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing expensive
black-box objective functions. While extensive research has been conducted on
the single-objective optimization problem, the multi-objective optimization
problem remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MOBO-OSD, a
multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm designed to generate a diverse
set of Pareto optimal solutions by solving multiple constrained optimization
problems, referred to as MOBO-OSD subproblems, along orthogonal search
directions (OSDs) defined with respect to an approximated convex hull of
individual objective minima. By employing a well-distributed set of OSDs,
MOBO-OSD ensures broad coverage of the objective space, enhancing both solution
diversity and hypervolume performance. To further improve the density of the
set of Pareto optimal candidate solutions without requiring an excessive number
of subproblems, we leverage a Pareto Front Estimation technique to generate
additional solutions in the neighborhood of existing solutions. Additionally,
MOBO-OSD supports batch optimization, enabling parallel function evaluations to
accelerate the optimization process when resources are available. Through
extensive experiments and analysis on a variety of synthetic and real-world
benchmark functions with two to six objectives, we demonstrate that MOBO-OSD
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code
implementation can be found at https://github.com/LamNgo1/mobo-osd.

Motivation: 传统方法强制弱模态与主导模态对齐（正向学习），导致弱模态独特信息被抑制，难以应对模态不平衡和噪声干扰。

Method: 引入多模态负向学习（MNL）框架，通过动态引导机制使主导模态指导弱模态抑制非目标类，提升单模态置信边界（UCoM），理论上保证鲁棒性提升。

Conclusion: 负向学习为多模态学习提供了新视角，能有效保留弱模态独特信息，提升系统鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality
imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering
the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak
modalities to align with dominant ones in "Learning to be (the same)" (Positive
Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak
modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:
"Learning Not to be" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'
target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak
modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and
preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve
unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal
learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal
Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance
mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the
robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal
Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities,
particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
approach against competing methods. The code will be available at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves model output accuracy by
leveraging external knowledge bases, serving as an effective solution to
address hallucination issues and knowledge-update delays in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents
RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory
consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by
precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them
on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV
chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware
RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical
distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision
compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead.
Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes
storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data
access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with
TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum
speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.

Motivation: 传统SGD理论无法解释其在复杂损失景观中优于局部收敛的泛化能力，需从全局动力学角度解析。

Method: 基于Wang和Rhee(2023)的大偏差与亚稳态分析，构建重尾SGD的全局动力学理论框架，并引入梯度裁剪。

Result: 理论与实验表明，重尾SGD+梯度裁剪能更有效避开尖锐极小值，找到更平坦的局部极小值，显著提升测试集泛化性能。

Conclusion: 重尾噪声与梯度裁剪的结合为提升SGD泛化能力提供了新视角，挑战了传统局部收敛分析范式。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants enable modern artificial
intelligence. However, theoretical understanding lags far behind their
empirical success. It is widely believed that SGD has a curious ability to
avoid sharp local minima in the loss landscape, which are associated with poor
generalization. To unravel this mystery and further enhance such capability of
SGDs, it is imperative to go beyond the traditional local convergence analysis
and obtain a comprehensive understanding of SGDs' global dynamics. In this
paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large
deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp
characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we
reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then
truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost
completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for
the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical
prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with
a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.

Abstract: We study the problem of regression with interval targets, where only upper
and lower bounds on target values are available in the form of intervals. This
problem arises when the exact target label is expensive or impossible to
obtain, due to inherent uncertainties. In the absence of exact targets,
traditional regression loss functions cannot be used. First, we study the
methodology of using a loss functions compatible with interval targets, for
which we establish non-asymptotic generalization bounds based on smoothness of
the hypothesis class that significantly relaxing prior assumptions of
realizability and small ambiguity degree. Second, we propose a novel min-max
learning formulation: minimize against the worst-case (maximized) target labels
within the provided intervals. The maximization problem in the latter is
non-convex, but we show that good performance can be achieved with the
incorporation of smoothness constraints. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on real-world datasets and show that our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: 该工作系统性地将元学习应用于蛋白质突变分析，提出高效的突变编码方法，为蛋白质工程中的跨领域泛化提供了变革性框架

Abstract: Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making
accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein
engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning
protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with
cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and
limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first
application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property
prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens
to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon
transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation
to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning
dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical
limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown
tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse
protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and
solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.
In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better
accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better
accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains
consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it
particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein
design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic
application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an
effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for
cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.

Conclusion: LBS首次统一LLM与SSM，为多模态时间推理提供了新基础，兼具灵活性、不确定性量化与泛化能力。

Abstract: Forecasting in the real world requires integrating structured time-series
data with unstructured textual information, but existing methods are
architecturally limited by fixed input/output horizons and are unable to model
or quantify uncertainty. We address this challenge by introducing
LLM-integrated Bayesian State space models (LBS), a novel probabilistic
framework for multimodal temporal forecasting. At a high level, LBS consists of
two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the
temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual
observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that
is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode
textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables
flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification,
and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias
of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus
benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20%
while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast. Our work is the
first to unify LLMs and SSMs for joint numerical and textual prediction,
offering a novel foundation for multimodal temporal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有安全保证方法依赖对安全规范的详细知识，而许多安全问题难以显式描述，更适合用不变性表征。

Method: 利用模型预测路径积分控制在训练中检验学习策略提出的动作安全性，仅需查询黑箱动力学系统。

Result: 所提算法能成功阻止所有不安全动作，同时训练进度与允许违禁的PPO基线相当。

Conclusion: 可逆性作为安全保障机制有效且实用，适用于未知动力学与复杂安全约束的场景。

Abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning approaches are promising for control but
typically lack formal safety guarantees. Existing methods to shield or
otherwise provide these guarantees often rely on detailed knowledge of the
safety specifications. Instead, this work's insight is that many
difficult-to-specify safety issues are best characterized by invariance.
Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing
these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses
model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action
proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this
approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics,
not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all
unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a
baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.

Abstract: Falls among elderly and disabled individuals remain a leading cause of injury
and mortality worldwide, necessitating robust, accurate, and privacy-aware fall
detection systems. Traditional fall detection approaches, whether centralized
or point-wise, often struggle with key challenges such as limited
generalizability, data privacy concerns, and variability in individual movement
behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized
Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized
modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL
leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while
preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training.
Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local
training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and
adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark
fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving
a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly
outperforming both centralized and baseline models. This work presents a
scalable, secure, and accurate solution for real-world fall detection in
healthcare settings, with strong potential for continuous improvement via its
adaptive feedback mechanism.

provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection.
However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the
debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it
leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting
the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and
underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new
collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum
game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other
in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each
other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based
on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly
outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements
over single-agent methods in error detection.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于向量copula理论的互信息估计方法，在复杂性和容量间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有互信息估计器要么依赖复杂模型（如神经网络）需大量数据，要么使用过于简化的模型（如高斯Copula）无法捕捉复杂分布。

Method: 利用向量copula理论，在复杂模型与简化模型之间进行有原则的插值。

Result: 在合成基准和真实多模态数据上验证了该估计器的优越性能。

Conclusion: 所提方法在数据效率和建模能力上优于传统方法。

Abstract: Estimating mutual information (MI) is a fundamental task in data science and
machine learning. Existing estimators mainly rely on either highly flexible
models (e.g., neural networks), which require large amounts of data, or overly
simplified models (e.g., Gaussian copula), which fail to capture complex
distributions. Drawing upon recent vector copula theory, we propose a
principled interpolation between these two extremes to achieve a better
trade-off between complexity and capacity. Experiments on state-of-the-art
synthetic benchmarks and real-world data with diverse modalities demonstrate
the advantages of the proposed estimator.

TL;DR: INRs在血流动力学和心血管解剖建模中实现高效压缩与高精度表示，SIREN、MFN-Gabor和MHE表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管INRs具有分辨率无关和内存高效的优势，但在医学领域如血流动力学和解剖建模中的准确性尚未充分评估。

Method: 采用多种策略缓解频谱偏差，包括特殊激活函数、固定和可训练的位置编码、非线性核线性组合，评估其在胸主动脉血流场和解剖结构上的性能。

Result: 在血流场压缩中达到约230倍压缩比，压力误差1 mmHg、速度误差5-10 cm/s；解剖建模平均误差<0.5 mm，最大误差<1.6 mm；SIREN、MFN-Gabor、MHE表现最优。

Conclusion: INRs在医学成像和模拟中具有巨大潜力，无需复杂超参调优即可实现高精度与高效率的表示。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs, also known as neural fields) have
recently emerged as a powerful framework for knowledge representation,
synthesis, and compression. By encoding fields as continuous functions within
the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or
mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both
resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in
domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work,
we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic
fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular
anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to
mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed
and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear
kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the
thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to
approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10
cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic
aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies
were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively. Overall, the SIREN, MFN-Gabor, and
MHE architectures demonstrated the best performance. Source code and data is

Motivation: 传统语言模型难以处理MOFs等复杂材料的三维结构与拓扑规则，依赖人类专家经验，缺乏可编码的文本信息。

Method: L2M3OF融合预训练晶体编码器与轻量投影层，将结构信息转化为语言标记，联合处理结构、文本与知识模态，并构建专属结构-性质-知识数据库进行训练与评估。

Result: L2M3OF在属性预测和知识生成任务中超越GPT-5、Gemini-2.5-Pro和DeepSeek-R1等先进文本模型，且参数量更少。

Conclusion: 多模态方法对多孔材料理解至关重要，L2M3OF为下一代材料发现AI系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities
across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in
scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical
phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A
compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical
for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage.
Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based
representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous
possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of
coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in
LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains
heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information
alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM
for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language
understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly.
L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection
layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient
alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we
curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and
benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5,
Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms
leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge
generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight
the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and
establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials
discovery.

Motivation: 设备端神经网络训练受限于内存约束，难以适配预训练模型到下游任务。

Method: 提出MeDyate框架，包含LaRa（层重要性排序）和动态通道采样策略，根据通道重要性分布随时间稳定性，在训练周期间动态重采样通道。

Result: 在多种任务和架构上实现SOTA性能，显著优于静态与动态方法，内存占用低至数百kB且计算高效。

Conclusion: MeDyate为设备端高效学习提供关键突破，支持在极低内存下实现有效微调。

Abstract: On-device neural network training faces critical memory constraints that
limit the adaptation of pre-trained models to downstream tasks. We present
MeDyate, a theoretically-grounded framework for memory-constrained dynamic
subnetwork adaptation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: LaRa (Layer
Ranking), an improved layer importance metric that enables principled layer
pre-selection, and a dynamic channel sampling strategy that exploits the
temporal stability of channel importance distributions during fine-tuning.
MeDyate dynamically resamples channels between epochs according to
importance-weighted probabilities, ensuring comprehensive parameter space
exploration while respecting strict memory budgets. Extensive evaluation across
a large panel of tasks and architectures demonstrates that MeDyate achieves
state-of-the-art performance under extreme memory constraints, consistently
outperforming existing static and dynamic approaches while maintaining high
computational efficiency. Our method represents a significant step towards
enabling efficient on-device learning by demonstrating effective fine-tuning
with memory budgets as low as a few hundred kB of RAM.

TL;DR: ESCORT是一种基于粒子的框架，通过Stein变分和切片一致性优化，准确捕捉高维多模态信念分布，显著提升POMDP中的决策质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有信念近似方法难以准确表示高维、多模态的复杂不确定性结构，导致估计误差和次优行为。

Method: ESCORT在SVGD基础上引入相关性感知投影和时间一致性约束，动态适应信念分布复杂性，避免重采样和参数假设。

Result: 在多个POMDP域和合成多模态分布上，ESCORT在信念逼近精度和下游决策质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ESCORT提供了一种灵活、高效且准确的信念表示方法，适用于复杂部分可观测环境中的不确定性建模。

Abstract: In Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), maintaining and
updating belief distributions over possible underlying states provides a
principled way to summarize action-observation history for effective
decision-making under uncertainty. As environments grow more realistic, belief
distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot
accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining
representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic
modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately
represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal
belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal
agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient
Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal
beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal
distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two
key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between
state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates
while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's
attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of
intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or
parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically
adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive
distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through
extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal
distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and
downstream decision quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀量化在低比特下性能下降明显，需更高效量化方法以降低LLM推理资源需求

Method: 引入分组格向量量化（GLVQ），为每组权重学习定制格码本，采用Babai舍入解决不可导问题，推理时仅需矩阵向量乘法

Result: 在多个基准上优于现有PTQ方法，实现更优的模型大小与精度权衡

Conclusion: GLVQ为资源受限场景下的大模型部署提供高效实用的量化方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but
typically require extensive computational resources and memory for inference.
Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by
storing weights in lower bit-width formats. However, standard uniform
quantization often leads to notable performance degradation, particularly in
low-bit scenarios. In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector
Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized
lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the
non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to
approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable
optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a
simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical
quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our
approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared
to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its
effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

Abstract: In response to the increasingly critical demand for accurate prediction of
GPU memory resources in deep learning tasks, this paper deeply analyzes the
current research status and innovatively proposes a deep learning model that
integrates bidirectional gated recurrent units (BiGRU) to optimize the
Transformer architecture, aiming to improve the accuracy of memory demand
prediction. To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed
comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic
machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as
benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer
optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in
key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean
square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison
models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual
values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination
(R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and
stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark
machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on
bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in
this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction
tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been
significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This
research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for
optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and
improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.

Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations,
Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained

mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal

convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions,
and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its
effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架在不依赖领域特化的情况下实现高性能、低功耗、小参数的通用脉冲神经网络分类，适用于资源受限的实时监测场景。

Abstract: We present a general framework for training spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
perform binary classification on multivariate time series, with a focus on
step-wise prediction and high precision at low false alarm rates. The approach
uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to
evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and
parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by
thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple
voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness.
  To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific
optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive
sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49
neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false
alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%)
baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same
false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform
demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency.
  We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without
domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An
ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent
deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.

Conclusion: DD2显著推动了一步AR生成的发展，实现高速高质的生成新可能。

Abstract: Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of
visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from
slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required.
Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step
sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance
degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that
limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled
Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for
image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined
mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the
ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token
position. Based on this, we propose a novel \emph{conditional score
distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a
separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution
and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous
tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image
AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256.
Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the
one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\times$
training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal
of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and
high-quality AR modeling. Code is available at

Abstract: Representation learning is increasingly applied to generate representations
that generalize well across multiple downstream tasks. Ensuring fairness
guarantees in representation learning is crucial to prevent unfairness toward
specific demographic groups in downstream tasks. In this work, we formally
introduce the task of learning representations that achieve high-confidence
fairness. We aim to guarantee that demographic disparity in every downstream
prediction remains bounded by a *user-defined* error threshold $\epsilon$, with
*controllable* high probability. To this end, we propose the ***F**air
**R**epresentation learning with high-confidence **G**uarantees (FRG)*
framework, which provides these high-confidence fairness guarantees by
leveraging an optimized adversarial model. We empirically evaluate FRG on three
real-world datasets, comparing its performance to six state-of-the-art fair
representation learning methods. Our results demonstrate that FRG consistently
bounds unfairness across a range of downstream models and tasks.

Method: 理论分析与实验验证零阶优化导致更平坦的损失曲面，从而减少遗忘；提出ZO-FC，仅对适配器模块使用零阶优化，分类器仍用一阶优化。

Result: 零阶优化增强稳定性但削弱可塑性，尤其在可学习分类器下；ZO-FC在保持内存低开销下实现稳定性与可塑性的平衡。

Conclusion: ZO-FC是一种实用且内存高效的设备端持续学习方案，通过结构化设计有效缓解三难问题。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Conclusion: 学习率的选择与算法设计同样重要，对统计与计算效率有决定性影响。

Abstract: To understand feature learning dynamics in neural networks, recent
theoretical works have focused on gradient-based learning of Gaussian
single-index models, where the label is a nonlinear function of a latent
one-dimensional projection of the input. While the sample complexity of online
SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent
works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample
with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule --
and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent.
However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently
large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s)
and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that
encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate
that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an "information
exponent regime" with small learning rate to a "generative exponent regime"
with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD
and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training
algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning
rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing
samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study
demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of
the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Labeling or classifying time series is a persistent challenge in the physical
sciences, where expert annotations are scarce, costly, and often inconsistent.
Yet robust labeling is essential to enable machine learning models for
understanding, prediction, and forecasting. We present the \textit{Clustering
and Indexation Pipeline with Human Evaluation for Recognition} (CIPHER), a
framework designed to accelerate large-scale labeling of complex time series in
physics. CIPHER integrates \textit{indexable Symbolic Aggregate approXimation}
(iSAX) for interpretable compression and indexing, density-based clustering
(HDBSCAN) to group recurring phenomena, and a human-in-the-loop step for
efficient expert validation. Representative samples are labeled by domain

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法忽视物理定律且无法量化预测不确定性，限制了长期时空预测的准确性与可靠性

Method: 引入物理一致神经算子（PCNO），通过傅里叶空间投影强制守恒定律；进一步提出DiffPCNO，结合一致性扩散模型量化并降低不确定性

Result: PCNO与DiffPCNO在湍流、洪水和大气预报等多场景中实现高保真、物理一致且 uncertainty-aware 的预测

Conclusion: 所提两阶段框架为准确、物理可信且考虑不确定性的时空预测提供了通用 robust 方法

Abstract: Accurate long-term forecasting of spatiotemporal dynamics remains a
fundamental challenge across scientific and engineering domains. Existing
machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to
quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these
challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that
enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto
function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection
layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in
Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a
diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model
to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and
reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity
spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and
uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from
turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our
two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate,
physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出关键词检测（KWS）作为脑机接口的实用中间任务，基于LibriBrain数据集和新评估指标，实现可复现、低资源训练的脑内文本识别基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑机接口基准任务过于简单，无法支撑实际应用（如脑到文本），亟需更贴近真实场景的中间任务。

Method: 构建52小时内被试的LibriBrain数据集，采用AUPRC和FA/h评估指标，提出轻量级1D Conv/ResNet模型并开源pnpl库与教程。

Result: 参考模型在保留会话上达到置换基线13倍的AUPRC，发现性能随训练时长对数增长，词频与持续时长显著影响检测效果。

Conclusion: KWS任务为脑机接口提供了可行的应用过渡路径，数据集与工具开源将推动领域标准化与可复现研究。

Abstract: Non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beginning to benefit from
large, public benchmarks. However, current benchmarks target relatively simple,
foundational tasks like Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification, while
application-ready results on tasks like Brain-to-Text remain elusive. We
propose Keyword Spotting (KWS) as a practically applicable, privacy-aware
intermediate task. Using the deep 52-hour, within-subject LibriBrain corpus, we
provide standardized train/validation/test splits for reproducible
benchmarking, and adopt an evaluation protocol tailored to extreme class
imbalance. Concretely, we use area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) as
a robust evaluation metric, complemented by false alarms per hour (FA/h) at
fixed recall to capture user-facing trade-offs. To simplify deployment and
further experimentation within the research community, we are releasing an
updated version of the pnpl library with word-level dataloaders and Colab-ready
tutorials. As an initial reference model, we present a compact 1-D Conv/ResNet
baseline with focal loss and top-k pooling that is trainable on a single
consumer-class GPU. The reference model achieves approximately 13x the
permutation baseline AUPRC on held-out sessions, demonstrating the viability of
the task. Exploratory analyses reveal: (i) predictable within-subject scaling -
performance improves log-linearly with more training hours - and (ii) the
existence of word-level factors (frequency and duration) that systematically
modulate detectability.

TL;DR: 提出A-GPS框架，通过生成模型在线逼近帕累托集，结合用户偏好与非主导性估计，无需显式计算超体积。


<details>

Motivation: 现有多目标优化方法在离散黑箱场景下样本效率低，且难以灵活融合用户偏好。

Method: 采用类概率估计器(CPE)预测非主导关系，构建生成模型，引入偏好方向向量指导采样，联合优化帕累托成员与偏好对齐。

Result: 在合成基准和蛋白质设计任务中，A-GPS实现高样本效率与高质量帕累托集逼近，避免超体积计算并有效捕捉偏好。

Conclusion: A-GPS是一种简单而强大的在线多目标优化框架，能高效生成符合用户偏好的帕累托集。

Abstract: We introduce active generation of Pareto sets (A-GPS), a new framework for
online discrete black-box multi-objective optimization (MOO). A-GPS learns a
generative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on
user preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to
predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward
high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this
non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume
improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces
preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in
objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto
membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an
amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without
retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves
high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume
computation, and flexibly captures user preferences. Empirical results on
synthetic benchmarks and protein design tasks demonstrate strong sample
efficiency and effective preference incorporation.

Result: 算法在保持公平性的同时，实现与分数解相同的期望性能，且学习增强版本能更好权衡公平与效率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多类在线公平分配的挑战，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the online multi-class selection problem with group fairness
guarantees, where limited resources must be allocated to sequentially arriving
agents. Our work addresses two key limitations in the existing literature.
First, we introduce a novel lossless rounding scheme that ensures the integral
algorithm achieves the same expected performance as any fractional solution.
Second, we explicitly address the challenges introduced by agents who belong to
multiple classes. To this end, we develop a randomized algorithm based on a
relax-and-round framework. The algorithm first computes a fractional solution
using a resource reservation approach -- referred to as the set-aside mechanism
-- to enforce fairness across classes. The subsequent rounding step preserves
these fairness guarantees without degrading performance. Additionally, we
propose a learning-augmented variant that incorporates untrusted
machine-learned predictions to better balance fairness and efficiency in
practical settings.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) is a cornerstone of modern reinforcement learning
(RL), with diverse applications spanning robotics, healthcare, and large
language model training. The increasing deployment of PO in sensitive domains,
however, raises significant privacy concerns. In this paper, we initiate a
theoretical study of differentially private policy optimization, focusing
explicitly on its sample complexity. We first formalize an appropriate
definition of differential privacy (DP) tailored to PO, addressing the inherent
challenges arising from on-policy learning dynamics and the subtlety involved
in defining the unit of privacy. We then systematically analyze the sample
complexity of widely-used PO algorithms, including policy gradient (PG),
natural policy gradient (NPG) and more, under DP constraints and various
settings, via a unified framework. Our theoretical results demonstrate that
privacy costs can often manifest as lower-order terms in the sample complexity,
while also highlighting subtle yet important observations in private PO
settings. These offer valuable practical insights for privacy-preserving PO
algorithms.

Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning framework for analyzing Parker Solar
Probe (PSP) solar wind data using distributed processing and the
quantum-inspired Kernel Density Matrices (KDM) method. The PSP dataset
(2018--2024) exceeds 150 GB, challenging conventional analysis approaches. Our
framework leverages Dask for large-scale statistical computations and KDM to
estimate univariate and bivariate distributions of key solar wind parameters,
including solar wind speed, proton density, and proton thermal speed, as well
as anomaly thresholds for each parameter. We reveal characteristic trends in
the inner heliosphere, including increasing solar wind speed with distance from
the Sun, decreasing proton density, and the inverse relationship between speed
and density. Solar wind structures play a critical role in enhancing and
mediating extreme space weather phenomena and can trigger geomagnetic storms;
our analyses provide quantitative insights into these processes. This approach
offers a tractable, interpretable, and distributed methodology for exploring
complex physical datasets and facilitates reproducible analysis of large-scale
in situ measurements. Processed data products and analysis tools are made
publicly available to advance future studies of solar wind dynamics and space
weather forecasting. The code and configuration files used in this study are

Conclusion: 最短答案启发式是一种帕累托改进，简单、高效、通用，为推理模型优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning models represent a significant advance in LLM capabilities,
particularly for complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding.
Previous studies confirm that parallel test-time compute-sampling multiple
solutions and selecting the best one-can further enhance the predictive
performance of LLMs. However, strategies in this area often require complex
scoring, thus increasing computational cost and complexity. In this work, we
demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the
shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness
stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident
conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by
uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking
regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the
heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that
this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency
across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational
overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over
self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well
defined.

Motivation: 现有理论多假设最后一层特征为自由变量，但忽略了数据结构和非线性激活的影响，本文旨在更真实地建模网络训练过程。

Method: 分析梯度流在两层ReLU网络上对正交可分数据的动态行为，证明其收敛至NC。

Result: 首次在有约束特征和非线性激活下，理论证明梯度流会自然引发NC，揭示训练动态的隐式偏差是关键因素。

Conclusion: NC的出现不仅源于优化目标，更受数据结构与训练动力学隐式偏置共同驱动。

Abstract: Among many mysteries behind the success of deep networks lies the exceptional
discriminative power of their learned representations as manifested by the
intriguing Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, where simple feature structures
emerge at the last layer of a trained neural network. Prior works on the
theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization
landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer
features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their
global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a
two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably
exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the
assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and
nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of
the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了协同执行中的同步与预测难题，显著提升移动端DNN推理效率，接近理论最优性能。

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on mobile devices is increasingly important
but remains challenging due to limited computing resources. On the other hand,
their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU
performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning
tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution
are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial
results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to
CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism
level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight
synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory
(SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times.
Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels
and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile
platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution
strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup
for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and
1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).

Conclusion: DictPFL首次证明HE基联邦学习可实际部署，实现隐私与效率的平衡

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
institutions without sharing raw data. However, gradient sharing still risks
privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption
(HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and
communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes:
encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting
gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL,
a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal
overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping
non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation.
It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which
decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup
table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary
remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and
Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to
minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments
show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\times$ and accelerates
training by 28-65$\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming
state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\times$ in overhead and
4-19$\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\times$ of
plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated
learning is practical for real-world deployment. The code is publicly available

Result: 在五个标准小样本分子性质预测基准上，该方法持续优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 集成全局模体知识与细粒度局部上下文，能有效提升小样本分子性质预测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a cornerstone of drug discovery and
materials science, yet conventional deep learning approaches depend on large
labeled datasets that are often unavailable. Few-shot Molecular property
prediction (FSMPP) addresses this scarcity by incorporating relational
inductive bias through a context graph that links molecule nodes to property
nodes, but such molecule-property graphs offer limited structural guidance. We
propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for
few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information
at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful
motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional
groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph,
yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range
compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with
common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the
molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's
attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments
on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. These results underscore the
effectiveness of integrating global motif knowledge with fine-grained local
context to advance robust few-shot molecular property prediction.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting limited features to observe such that
models trained on them can perform well simultaneously across multiple
subpopulations. This problem has applications in settings where collecting each
feature is costly, e.g. requiring adding survey questions or physical sensors,
and we must be able to use the selected features to create high-quality
downstream models for different populations. Our method frames the problem as a
continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising
mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.
By optimizing over the variance of a Bayes-optimal predictor, we develop a
model-agnostic framework that balances overall performance of downstream
prediction across populations. We validate our approach through experiments on
both synthetic datasets and real-world data.

Conclusion: SolarBoost为分布式光伏功率预测提供了新范式，具备实际应用价值，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents SolarBoost, a novel approach for forecasting power output
in distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems. While existing centralized
photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due
to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs
face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed
capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes
these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output
from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output
function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous
unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient
algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome
computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of
grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has
been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly
reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of
power grids. The code for this work is available at

Result: 实验表明，随着工作流复杂度增加，该框架性能优于基线，凸显其学习长期策略的能力。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效应对复杂大规模MIoT调度场景，具备良好的扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) demands stringent end-to-end latency
guarantees for sequential healthcare workflows deployed over heterogeneous
cloud-fog-edge infrastructures. Scheduling these sequential workflows to
minimize makespan is an NP-hard problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Two-tier DDPG-based scheduling framework that decomposes the scheduling
decision into a hierarchical process: a global controller performs layer
selection (edge, fog, or cloud), while specialized local controllers handle
node assignment within the chosen layer. The primary optimization objective is
the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our
approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as
workflow complexity rises. This trend highlights the frameworks ability to
learn effective long-term strategies, which is critical for complex,
large-scale MIoT scheduling scenarios.

Abstract: Designing de novo 3D molecules with desirable properties remains a
fundamental challenge in drug discovery and molecular engineering. While
diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality 3D molecular structures, they often struggle to effectively
control complex multi-objective constraints critical for real-world
applications. In this study, we propose an uncertainty-aware Reinforcement
Learning (RL) framework to guide the optimization of 3D molecular diffusion
models toward multiple property objectives while enhancing the overall quality
of the generated molecules. Our method leverages surrogate models with
predictive uncertainty estimation to dynamically shape reward functions,
facilitating balance across multiple optimization objectives. We
comprehensively evaluate our framework across three benchmark datasets and
multiple diffusion model architectures, consistently outperforming baselines
for molecular quality and property optimization. Additionally, Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations and ADMET profiling of top generated candidates
indicate promising drug-like behavior and binding stability, comparable to
known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. Our results
demonstrate the strong potential of RL-guided generative diffusion models for
advancing automated molecular design.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified matrix factorization framework for classical
and robust clustering. We begin by revisiting the well-known equivalence
between crisp k-means clustering and matrix factorization, following and
rigorously rederiving an unpublished formulation by Bauckhage. Extending this
framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy
c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously
formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be
expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling
principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers,
we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing
the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean
norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms
for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust
counterparts. All algorithms are theoretically proven to converge to a local
minimum.

Abstract: The Meteorology is a field where huge amounts of data are generated, mainly
collected by sensors at weather stations, where different variables can be
measured. Those data have some particularities such as high volume and
dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and
the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial
to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and
extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict
weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is
designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user
analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables
(temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads
them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal
and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using
univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training
data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The
system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance,
obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an
overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated
positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except
graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary
results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep
working on this area.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种无需闭式解的通用算法框架，用于主Agent合同设计中的双层优化，基于隐式微分与共轭梯度法，适用于复杂非线性场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性二次模型虽有解析解，但现实场景中非线性效用、随机动态或高维动作导致闭式解不可得，亟需通用计算工具。

Method: 采用隐式微分结合共轭梯度（CG）计算超梯度，避免构造或求逆Hessian矩阵，实现矩阵自由、方差降低、与问题无关的优化。

Result: 在CARA-Normal基准环境中恢复已知解析最优解，并能可靠收敛；可扩展至sigmoid薪酬、竞赛激励、多任务合约、CARA-Poisson模型等复杂非线性场景。

Conclusion: 该框架为原本解析不可解的合同设计问题提供了新型计算工具，推动了契约理论在现实复杂环境中的系统性研究。

Abstract: We study a bilevel \emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent
contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility
while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral
hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design
to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive
compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr"om-Milgrom admit
closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities,
stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not.
  We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on
closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel
optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) --
to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without
ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute
Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the
approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random
initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and
problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear
contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage
schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with
common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous
noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\mathbb{E}[X\mid a]=e^{a}$. This
provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic
study of models that have remained analytically intractable.

*Stephen Zhao,Aidan Li,Rob Brekelmans,Roger Grosse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe通过增强RL损失，降低低奖励输出的概率，在维持平均奖励的同时提升对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RL方法优化平均奖励，但难以有效减少不良输出；现有降低不良输出的方法常牺牲平均性能。

Method: RePULSe在标准RL损失基础上，引入基于学习提议的附加损失，引导采样并降低低奖励输出的概率。

Result: RePULSe在预期奖励与不良输出概率之间取得更优权衡，且对抗鲁棒性优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RePULSe是一个有效改善RL对齐中性能-安全权衡的训练方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

TL;DR: PLAN是一种基于LoRA的主动低秩分配框架，用于持续学习中高效且减少干扰的微调大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习需要模型在适应新任务时避免遗忘旧知识，现有方法在参数分配和干扰控制上存在不足。

Method: PLAN通过为每个任务引入正交基向量，并采用扰动策略优化以最小化与已有参数的冲突，同时设计敏感性选择机制来降低知识退化风险。

Result: 在标准持续学习基准上，PLAN consistently优于现有方法，达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: PLAN实现了高效、低干扰的持续微调，为大模型的持续学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) requires models to continuously adapt to new tasks
without forgetting past knowledge. In this work, we propose
\underline{P}roactive \underline{L}ow-rank \underline{A}llocatio\underline{N}
(PLAN), a framework that extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient
and interference-aware fine-tuning of large pre-trained models in CL settings.
PLAN proactively manages the allocation of task-specific subspaces by
introducing orthogonal basis vectors for each task and optimizing them through
a perturbation-based strategy that minimizes conflicts with previously learned
parameters. Furthermore, PLAN incorporates a novel selection mechanism that
identifies and assigns basis vectors with minimal sensitivity to interference,
reducing the risk of degrading past knowledge while maintaining efficient
adaptation to new tasks. Empirical results on standard CL benchmarks
demonstrate that PLAN consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a
new state-of-the-art for continual learning with foundation models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出GenReview数据集，包含8.1万条LLM生成的审稿意见，用于研究LLM在学术评审中的应用与影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM已被隐性或显性用于学术评审，但缺乏大规模标注数据来系统研究其效用与风险。

Method: 构建GenReview数据集，基于ICLR 2018–2025所有投稿，使用三种提示（负面、正面、中立）生成LLM审稿意见，并关联原始论文与人工审稿意见。

Result: 发现LLM审稿存在偏见、可被检测、不总遵循指令，且其评分仅对接受论文与决策一致。

Conclusion: GenReview为研究LLM在学术评审中的角色提供了关键资源，揭示其潜力与隐患，亟需规范使用。

Abstract: How does the progressive embracement of Large Language Models (LLMs) affect
scientific peer reviewing? This multifaceted question is fundamental to the
effectiveness -- as well as to the integrity -- of the scientific process.
Recent evidence suggests that LLMs may have already been tacitly used in peer
reviewing, e.g., at the 2024 International Conference of Learning
Representations (ICLR). Furthermore, some efforts have been undertaken in an
attempt to explicitly integrate LLMs in peer reviewing by various editorial
boards (including that of ICLR'25). To fully understand the utility and the
implications of LLMs' deployment for scientific reviewing, a comprehensive
relevant dataset is strongly desirable. Despite some previous research on this
topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting
GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our
dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025
editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a
negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the
respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of
investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of
intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they
do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can);
if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether
LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection
(holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the
following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.

*JunRu Luo,Difei Cheng,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于二阶统计量的新型替代损失函数，有效优化在线AUC，实现更优的收敛界和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AUC优化面临非凸、不连续的成对0/1损失及高内存开销的挑战，现有方法难以高效应用于大规模场景。

Method: 引入基于成对铰链损失的二阶替代损失，利用训练数据的一阶和二阶统计量直接替代聚合成对损失，并设计在线算法，扩展至核方法处理非线性情况。

Result: 理论证明达到O(ln T)的更紧后悔界，实验表明在多个基准数据集上效率与效果均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为在线AUC优化提供了更高效、可扩展的新范式，兼具理论保证与实用价值。

Abstract: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is an important performance metric for
classification tasks, particularly in class-imbalanced scenarios. However,
minimizing the AUC presents significant challenges due to the non-convex and
discontinuous nature of pairwise 0/1 losses, which are difficult to optimize,
as well as the substantial memory cost of instance-wise storage, which creates
bottlenecks in large-scale applications. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,
and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that
approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise
surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly
substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function
constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data.
Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically
achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter
$\mathcal{O}(\ln T)$ bound. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to
nonlinear settings through a kernel-based formulation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed second-order surrogate loss in optimizing online
AUC performance.

TL;DR: Mitra是一种基于合成数据先验的表格基础模型，通过优化合成数据的多样性与特性，在不使用真实数据预训练的情况下，显著超越现有模型如TabPFNv2和TabICL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格基础模型（TFMs）依赖合成数据预训练，但其先验设计缺乏系统指导，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 系统分析合成数据先验的关键属性，提出Mitra，采用经过筛选的多样化、具有区分性的合成先验混合训练模型。

Result: Mitra在分类和回归任务中均优于TabPFNv2和TabICL，且样本效率更高。

Conclusion: 合成数据先验的设计是提升TFM泛化能力的核心，Mitra为先验优化提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Since the seminal work of TabPFN, research on tabular foundation models
(TFMs) based on in-context learning (ICL) has challenged long-standing
paradigms in machine learning. Without seeing any real-world data, models
pretrained on purely synthetic datasets generalize remarkably well across
diverse datasets, often using only a moderate number of in-context examples.
This shifts the focus in tabular machine learning from model architecture
design to the design of synthetic datasets, or, more precisely, to the prior
distributions that generate them. Yet the guiding principles for prior design
remain poorly understood. This work marks the first attempt to address the gap.
We systematically investigate and identify key properties of synthetic priors
that allow pretrained TFMs to generalize well. Based on these insights, we
introduce Mitra, a TFM trained on a curated mixture of synthetic priors
selected for their diversity, distinctiveness, and performance on real-world
tabular data. Mitra consistently outperforms state-of-the-art TFMs, such as
TabPFNv2 and TabICL, across both classification and regression benchmarks, with
better sample efficiency.

Conclusion: ADaMoRE通过无监督方式有效提升图神经网络的自适应能力，为异构图学习提供了稳定高效的新型框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face a fundamental adaptability challenge: their
fixed message-passing architectures struggle with the immense diversity of
real-world graphs, where optimal computational strategies vary by local
structure and task. While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) offers a promising pathway
to adaptability, existing graph MoE methods remain constrained by their
reliance on supervised signals and instability when training heterogeneous
experts. We introduce ADaMoRE (Adaptive Mixture of Residual Experts), a
principled framework that enables robust, fully unsupervised training of
heterogeneous MoE on graphs. ADaMoRE employs a backbone-residual expert
architecture where foundational encoders provide stability while specialized
residual experts capture diverse computational patterns. A structurally-aware
gating network performs fine-grained node routing. The entire architecture is
trained end-to-end using a unified unsupervised objective, which integrates a
primary reconstruction task with an information-theoretic diversity regularizer
to explicitly enforce functional specialization among the experts. Theoretical
analysis confirms our design improves data efficiency and training stability.
Extensive evaluation across 16 benchmarks validates ADaMoRE's state-of-the-art
performance in unsupervised node classification and few-shot learning,
alongside superior generalization, training efficiency, and faster convergence
on diverse graphs and tasks.

Conclusion: 将物理语义嵌入生成流，可将神经网络的黑箱轨迹转化为可解释的物理过程。

Abstract: Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.

Result: 实验表明FDAs显著提升模型合并效果，且与参数空间方法互补。

Conclusion: FDAs提供了一种在输入表示空间进行模型合并的新范式，兼具鲁棒性与灵活性。

Abstract: Model merging is an efficient post-training strategy for integrating
knowledge from multiple finetuned checkpoints of a shared foundation model.
Existing methods operate in the parameter space, combining task vectors to
mitigate conflicts, but remain constrained by parameter inconsistencies. We
propose Functional Dual Anchors (FDAs), a framework that instead models the
input-representation space. FDAs are synthetic inputs whose induced gradients
align with task vectors, capturing task-specific functional shifts relative to
the pretrained model. This perspective bridges joint multi-task training and
post-hoc merging, offering both robustness and flexibility. We further
introduce a principled initialization scheme and show that FDAs are
complementary to parameter-space model merging. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of FDAs in model merging.

Conclusion: 该方法为深度模型基强化学习提供了理论支撑的探索策略设计思路，通过量化模型不确定性指导探索。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) theory, the concept of most confusing
instances is central to establishing regret lower bounds, that is, the minimal
exploration needed to solve a problem. Given a reference model and its optimal
policy, a most confusing instance is the statistically closest alternative
model that makes a suboptimal policy optimal. While this concept is
well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision
processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general
case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models
as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically
close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between
optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure
to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of
varying quality. Our results suggest that the degree of achievable confusion
correlates with uncertainty in the approximate model, which may inform
theoretically-grounded exploration strategies for deep model-based RL.

Abstract: Continuous-time models provide important insights into the training dynamics
of optimization algorithms in deep learning. In this work, we establish a
non-asymptotic convergence analysis of stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD), which is an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximation
of stochastic gradient descent in continuous time, in the lazy training regime.
We show that, under regularity conditions on the Hessian of the loss function,
SGLD with multiplicative and state-dependent noise (i) yields a non-degenerate
kernel throughout the training process with high probability, and (ii) achieves
exponential convergence to the empirical risk minimizer in expectation, and we
establish finite-time and finite-width bounds on the optimality gap. We
corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical examples in the regression

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling

versatility, numerous RNN variants have been proposed over the past decade,
aiming to improve the modeling of long-term dependencies and to address

Abstract: Recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning have shown that second-order
methods can enhance the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs),
making them a suitable alternative to traditional numerical methods for Partial
Differential Equations (PDEs). However, second-order methods induce large
memory requirements, making them scale poorly with the model size. In this
paper, we define a local Mixture of Experts (MoE) combining the
parameter-efficiency of ensemble models and sparse coding to enable the use of
second-order training. Our model -- \textsc{PINN Balls} -- also features a
fully learnable domain decomposition structure, achieved through the use of
Adversarial Adaptive Sampling (AAS), which adapts the DD to the PDE and its
domain. \textsc{PINN Balls} achieves better accuracy than the state-of-the-art
in scientific machine learning, while maintaining invaluable scalability
properties and drawing from a sound theoretical background.

Abstract: Graph attention has demonstrated superior performance in graph learning
tasks. However, learning from global interactions can be challenging due to the
large number of nodes. In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed
over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is
aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution
of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose
Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the
aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus
on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume
per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The
guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the
informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate
over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the
informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Buffer层的新型测试时自适应方法，避免对归一化层的依赖，提升模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性且防止灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于归一化层（如BN）的测试时自适应方法对小批量敏感，且受限于预训练模型结构，难以在显著域偏移下稳定适应。

Method: 引入Buffer层，不修改预训练骨干网络，通过可插拔的缓冲机制在线适应测试域，维持模型原有参数不变。

Result: 在多种架构和域偏移场景下显著优于传统方法，同时表现出更强的抗遗忘能力和模块化兼容性。

Conclusion: Buffer层提供了一种高效、通用且稳定的测试时自适应新范式，适合广泛部署于实际应用场景。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传感器噪声对人体活动识别（HAR）性能的负面影响，提升模型在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 针对每个惯性传感器位置训练独立的PatchTST模型，使用经过抖动、缩放、旋转和通道丢弃增强的训练数据来模拟测试噪声，推理时平均四个模型的softmax概率。

Result: 在2nd WEAR数据集挑战赛的私有排行榜上，宏F1分数显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 与测试噪声匹配的数据增强结合Transformer集成，是提升噪声环境下HAR鲁棒性的有效策略。

Abstract: We present a noise-aware, sensor-specific ensemble approach for robust human
activity recognition on the 2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge. Our method leverages
the PatchTST transformer architecture, training four independent models-one per
inertial sensor location-on a tampered training set whose 1-second sliding
windows are augmented to mimic the test-time noise. By aligning the train and
test data schemas (JSON-encoded 50-sample windows) and applying randomized
jitter, scaling, rotation, and channel dropout, each PatchTST model learns to
generalize across real-world sensor perturbations. At inference, we compute
softmax probabilities from all four sensor models on the Kaggle test set and
average them to produce final labels. On the private leaderboard, this pipeline
achieves a macro-F1 substantially above the baseline, demonstrating that
test-matched augmentation combined with transformer-based ensembling is an
effective strategy for robust HAR under noisy conditions.

TL;DR: 提出DVC方法，通过分层评估数据价值，在预算约束下显著提升MLP训练效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法难以处理非线性变换、忽略隐藏层信息且无法扩展至大模型

Method: DVC方法分解数据贡献为LVC和GVC，结合六种度量指标与UCB算法，从质量、相关性、分布多样性三方面动态评估数据

Result: 在六个数据集和八个基线方法上，DVC在不同预算下均显著优于现有方法，提升准确率和F1分数

Conclusion: DVC是首个系统性分层数据评估方法，兼具理论保障与实际优势，适用于大规模机器学习系统

Abstract: Data selection is one of the fundamental problems in neural network training,
particularly for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) where identifying the most
valuable training samples from massive, multi-source, and heterogeneous data
sources under budget constraints poses significant challenges. Existing data
selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and
influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify
nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in
hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational
complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel
budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that
accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The
DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and
Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and
corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three
dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different
granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and
exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under
various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores. Our
approach represents the first systematic treatment of hierarchical data
evaluation for neural networks, providing both theoretical guarantees and
practical advantages for large-scale machine learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管GAMs被视为可解释模型，但其解释生成的计算复杂性尚未系统分析，本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 通过计算复杂性理论分析，基于P!=NP等标准假设，研究不同类型GAM在不同输入域和任务下的解释生成难度。

Result: 发现GAM解释复杂性高度依赖输入空间结构、组件模型、任务类型；神经加性模型在特定条件下更易解释。

Conclusion: GAMs的可解释性并非天然高效，其解释可行性取决于具体设定，为后续解释算法设计提供理论指导。

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are commonly considered *interpretable*
within the ML community, as their structure makes the relationship between
inputs and outputs relatively understandable. Therefore, it may seem natural to
hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed
efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we
challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of
generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple
contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both
positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard
complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in
stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating
explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input
space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the
types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only
emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity
distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus
classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural
networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to
explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain
explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light
on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a
rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations
are possible or provably hard.

TL;DR: EPHAD是一种无需访问训练管道或先验知识的测试时自适应框架，用于在污染数据上训练的异常检测模型的测试阶段提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督异常检测方法假设训练数据干净，但现实数据常含未检测或错误标注的异常，导致性能下降，且现有解决方案受限于对训练数据、管道或异常比例的依赖。

Method: EPHAD结合已训练模型的先验知识与测试时从多模态基础模型（如CLIP）、经典方法（如Latent Outlier Factor）或领域知识中获取的证据，进行测试时输出更新。

Result: 在8个视觉、26个表格和1个工业真实数据集上实证验证，EPHAD显著提升性能，且对污染水平和超参数具有鲁棒性，支持多种模型与证据组合。

Conclusion: EPHAD是一种简单、有效、通用且无需额外训练的测试时自适应框架，适用于现实世界中 contaminated 数据的异常检测任务。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) methods typically assume clean training
data, yet real-world datasets often contain undetected or mislabeled anomalies,
leading to significant performance degradation. Existing solutions require
access to the training pipelines, data or prior knowledge of the proportions of
anomalies in the data, limiting their real-world applicability. To address this
challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation
framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated
datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the
prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with
evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent
Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind
EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through
comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular
AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct
an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying
contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD
across diverse AD models and evidence pairs. To ensure reproducibility, our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/sukanyapatra1997/EPHAD.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于 amortized 变分推断的概率框架，高效精确地估计真实标签后验，显著提升部分标签学习的准确率与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有部分标签学习方法或计算开销大，或依赖启发式标签优化与代理损失，缺乏严格的概率建模。

Method: 采用神经网络预测变分参数，通过 amortized 变分推断直接建模真实标签的后验分布，方法架构无关。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上实现最佳准确率与效率，理论分析与实验均验证其优越性。

Conclusion: 该概率框架统一了深度学习的表达力与概率建模的严谨性，为部分标签学习提供了新范式。

Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for
example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same
instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training
classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels,
only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true
label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning
approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label
refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly
approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized
variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict
variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This
approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of
probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 数据结构对模型多样性有根本影响，多样性感知机制可提升主动学习与数据填补性能。

Abstract: Multiplicity -- the existence of distinct models with comparable performance
-- has received growing attention in recent years. While prior work has largely
emphasized modelling choices, the critical role of data in shaping multiplicity
has been comparatively overlooked. In this work, we introduce a neighbouring
datasets framework to examine the most granular case: the impact of a
single-data-point difference on multiplicity. Our analysis yields a seemingly
counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class
distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional
expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it
with rigorous proofs.
  Building on this foundation, we extend our framework to two practical
domains: active learning and data imputation. For each, we establish natural
extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first
systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose
novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition
strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation
techniques.

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，首次在无需强假设下实现公平性驱动的多臂老虎机最优 regret 保证。

Abstract: Regret in stochastic multi-armed bandits traditionally measures the
difference between the highest reward and either the arithmetic mean of
accumulated rewards or the final reward. These conventional metrics often fail
to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings
where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical
trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret,
which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards,
aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness
axioms.
  To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm
designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration
inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even
Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform
exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm
achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding
bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we
generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the
$p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all
$p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive
assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret
bounds.

Motivation: 现有理论假设所有组件为精确值，忽视硬件感知的量化影响，无法解释低精度训练为何有效。

Method: 提出首个量化感知的收敛理论框架，分析梯度、权重和优化器状态的浮点量化对Adam与Muon收敛性的影响。

Result: 证明在尾数长度仅随迭代次数对数增长时，两类优化器仍能保持接近全精度的收敛速率；Adam对权重和二阶矩量化敏感，Muon更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 理论与实验一致，填补了低精度训练经验成功与理论理解之间的缺口。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) has made low-precision
training essential for reducing memory, improving efficiency, and enabling
larger models and datasets. Existing convergence theories for adaptive
optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware
quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains
effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the
convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under
floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,
moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth
non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,
explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components
affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their
full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only
logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals
that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to
its reliance on $\beta_2 \to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and
is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical
success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data corroborate our theory.

TL;DR: 提出SANI方法，通过擦除与修复两阶段在不重新训练的情况下消除语言模型中对敏感信息的记忆，显著减少泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调后的语言模型会记忆敏感数据（如医疗信息），导致隐私泄露风险，而传统重新训练成本高昂。

Method: SANI包含两阶段：1）重置模型最后层的部分神经元以破坏细粒度记忆；2）在避免重新记忆的前提下进行轻量微调。

Result: 仅需少量附加训练轮次，即可大幅减少敏感信息的复现，适用于医疗等敏感行业模型的净化。

Conclusion: SANI是一种高效、低成本的模型去记忆化方法，适合已训练模型的隐私合规需求。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Conclusion: ScoreNF为未归一化分布采样提供了一种数据高效、无偏且稳定的解决方案，突破传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Unnormalized probability distributions are central to modeling complex
physical systems across various scientific domains. Traditional sampling
methods, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), often suffer from slow
convergence, critical slowing down, poor mode mixing, and high autocorrelation.
In contrast, likelihood-based and adversarial machine learning models, though
effective, are heavily data-driven, requiring large datasets and often
encountering mode covering and mode collapse. In this work, we propose ScoreNF,
a score-based learning framework built on the Normalizing Flow (NF)
architecture, integrated with an Independent Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) module,
enabling efficient and unbiased sampling from unnormalized target
distributions. We show that ScoreNF maintains high performance even with small
training ensembles, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive
MCMC-generated training data. We also present a method for assessing
mode-covering and mode-collapse behaviours. We validate our method on synthetic
2D distributions (MOG-4 and MOG-8) and the high-dimensional $\phi^4$ lattice
field theory distribution, demonstrating its effectiveness for sampling tasks.

Conclusion: RAVEN 能自动识别可信弱模型并赋予更高权重，实现鲁棒的弱到强泛化。

Abstract: As future superhuman models become increasingly complex, accurately
supervising their behavior may exceed human capabilities. Recent works have
demonstrated that in such scenarios, weak models can effectively supervise
strong models, a phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization. However, we
find that naive weak-to-strong generalization fails under distribution shifts,
often leading to worse performance of the strong model than its weak
supervisors. To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong
generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of
weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and
preference alignment tasks. RAVEN outperforms alternative baselines by over 30%
on out-of-distribution tasks while matching or surpassing existing methods on
in-distribution tasks. Moreover, our results show that RAVEN assigns higher
weights to more accurate weak models, demonstrating its ability to
automatically identify trustworthy supervision.

Abstract: Fine-tuning has proven to be highly effective in adapting pre-trained models

introduce a new class of reparameterization methods for transfer learning,
designed to enhance the generalization ability of fine-tuned models. We
establish the effectiveness of our approach in a high-dimensional binary

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image

Abstract: Robust yield curve estimation is crucial in fixed-income markets for accurate
instrument pricing, effective risk management, and informed trading strategies.
Traditional approaches, including the bootstrapping method and parametric
Nelson-Siegel models, often struggle with overfitting or instability issues,
especially when underlying bonds are sparse, bond prices are volatile, or
contain hard-to-remove noise. In this paper, we propose a neural networkbased
framework for robust yield curve estimation tailored to small mortgage bond
markets. Our model estimates the yield curve independently for each day and
introduces a new loss function to enforce smoothness and stability, addressing
challenges associated with limited and noisy data. Empirical results on Swedish
mortgage bonds demonstrate that our approach delivers more robust and stable
yield curve estimates compared to existing methods such as
Nelson-Siegel-Svensson (NSS) and Kernel-Ridge (KR). Furthermore, the framework
allows for the integration of domain-specific constraints, such as alignment
with risk-free benchmarks, enabling practitioners to balance the trade-off
between smoothness and accuracy according to their needs.

*Whie Jung,Dong Hoon Lee,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种与目标和架构解耦的组合偏差，通过随机混合潜在变量实现属性、对象及二者联合的解耦表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解耦表示学习方法依赖特定于因子的策略（如目标或架构），当因子不符合先验假设或共存时，需重设计，开销大。

Method: 引入组合偏差，根据因子类型（如全局属性互斥、对象可共存）设计混合策略，结合先验损失与组合一致性损失，强制编码器学习对应的因子结构。

Result: 在属性和对象解耦任务上表现竞争性，首次实现全局风格与对象的联合解耦，且无需修改架构或目标。

Conclusion: 该方法通过灵活调整混合策略，统一处理多种解耦场景，为解耦表示学习提供了模块化、可扩展的新范式。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

TL;DR: C-MCTD通过全局规划和并行搜索提升MCTD的轨迹推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTD受限于训练轨迹长度，局部搜索缺乏全局上下文

Method: 提出C-MCTD，包含在线组合器、分布式组合器和预规划组合器三部分

Result: 实现全局感知的计划组合优化，降低搜索复杂度，加速推理

Conclusion: C-MCTD显著提升轨迹推理的效率与全局一致性

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) integrates diffusion models with structured
tree search to enable effective trajectory exploration through stepwise
reasoning. However, MCTD remains fundamentally limited by training trajectory
lengths. While periodic replanning allows plan concatenation for longer plan
generation, the planning process remains locally confined, as MCTD searches
within individual trajectories without access to global context. We propose
Compositional Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (C-MCTD), a framework that elevates
planning from individual trajectory optimization to reasoning over complete
plan compositions. C-MCTD introduces three complementary components: (1) Online
Composer, which performs globally-aware planning by searching across entire
plan compositions; (2) Distributed Composer, which reduces search complexity
through parallel exploration from multiple starting points; and (3) Preplan
Composer, which accelerates inference by leveraging cached plan graphs.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机神经网络的在线无任务类别增量学习（OTCIL）框架edRVFL-kF-Bayes，无需回放即可有效避免灾难性遗忘，提升长期学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIL方法在非独立同分布流数据和无任务边界提示的苛刻OTCIL场景下，面临记忆丧失与性能下降问题。

Method: 构造带前向正则化的随机神经网络（Randomized NN），推导出edRVFL-kF算法，引入可调正则强度k，并进一步提出基于贝叶斯学习的edRVFL-kF-Bayes，实现参数自适应。

Result: edRVFL-kF和edRVFL-kF-Bayes在两个图像数据集上超越经典岭回归方法，实现单次前向闭式更新、无需重放，且在多种指标和动态评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决OTCIL中的记忆遗忘与参数调优难题，为无回放、持续学习提供高效可扩展的新范式。

Abstract: Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of \emph{cost-sensitive} hyperparameter
optimization (HPO) built upon freeze-thaw Bayesian optimization (BO).
Specifically, we assume a scenario where users want to early-stop the HPO
process when the expected performance improvement is not satisfactory with
respect to the additional computational cost. Motivated by this scenario, we
introduce \emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing
the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the
user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel
acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue
training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in
the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum
utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw
methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the
cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established
multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous
freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a
significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/db-Lee/CFBO.

Method: 对8名睡眠医学专家进行用户研究，比较人工评分、黑箱AI辅助和透明白箱AI辅助三种模式，评估不同辅助时机（起始 vs. 质量控制）对评分准确性、耗时与用户体验的影响。

Result: AI辅助显著优于人工评分，降低评价差异；透明AI作为质量控制步骤比黑箱提升约30%事件级准确性，QC时机优化计数指标；白箱+QC虽耗时增加，但7/8医生愿采纳。

Conclusion: 战略性地部署透明AI作为质量控制工具，能平衡准确性与效率，是实现临床中可信赖AI集成的有效路径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly match or surpass human
experts in biomedical signal interpretation. However, their effective
integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy.
Clinicians must discern \textit{when} and \textit{why} to trust algorithmic
recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with
eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal
events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring,
(ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI
assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \textit{start} of scoring or
as a post-hoc quality-control (\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate
how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most
relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When
evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and
human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration
also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance
applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance
improvements of approximately 30\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing
further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the
time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by
most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven
out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no
modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance
effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising
pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical
workflows.

Motivation: 探索人类认知中联想学习导致的表征变化机制，但生物系统实验困难，故利用大语言模型作为可调控的替代方案。

Method: 基于大语言模型的上下文学习，采用认知神经科学中的联想学习范式，测试六种模型的表征演化。

Result: 发现表征变化呈现非单调模式：中等相似项目在学习后分化；词汇干扰越高，分化越显著，表明表征变化受项目相似性与全局竞争共同影响。

Conclusion: 大语言模型不仅是研究人类类似学习系统表征动态的强大工具，也是生成大脑记忆重组原理新假设的通用计算模型。

Abstract: Associative learning--forming links between co-occurring items--is
fundamental to human cognition, reshaping internal representations in complex
ways. Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological
systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable
alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive
neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations
evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern
consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately
similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of
LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of
associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary
interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We
find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting
that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global
competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying
representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as
accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about
the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.

Conclusion: 自扩散利用神经网络的频谱偏差，实现无需预训练的灵活逆问题求解，具有广泛适用性

Abstract: We propose self-diffusion, a novel framework for solving inverse problems
without relying on pretrained generative models. Traditional diffusion-based
approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the
forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions --
corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are
consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast,
self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates
between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the
solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current
estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional
network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain
iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy
estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural
networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on
pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains
adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it
highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.

Motivation: 传统PINN在超参数依赖、训练效率和预测精度上存在不足，亟需更高效的求解方法。

Method: 用极端学习机（ELM）替代深度神经网络，固定输入权重，通过最小二乘法求解物理约束损失的Moore-Penrose广义逆。

Result: 相较PINN，预测精度提升3-7个数量级，训练时间节省超94%。

Conclusion: PIELM为逆Stefan问题提供一种高效高精度的物理信息学习框架。

Abstract: The inverse Stefan problem, as a typical phase-change problem with moving
boundaries, finds extensive applications in science and engineering. Recent
years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to
solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter
dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this
paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid
physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM
replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine
network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output
weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by
initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations
(PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the
Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies
show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of
magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94%
training time, compared to conventional PINNs.

Method: GSAC通过学习稀疏局部因果掩码，生成状态与领域因素的指数级紧致近似紧凑表示（ACRs），并基于这些表示构建元Actor-Critic，在多个源域上训练共享策略，测试时仅需少量轨迹估计新领域因子并适应策略。

Result: GSAC在因果恢复、Actor-Critic收敛性和适应差距方面具有有限样本保证，适应速度快，显著超越从零学习和传统适应方法。

Conclusion: 将因果学习与元强化学习结合是解决大规模、动态网络系统强化学习问题的有效途径。

Abstract: Large-scale networked systems, such as traffic, power, and wireless grids,
challenge reinforcement-learning agents with both scale and environment shifts.
To address these challenges, we propose GSAC (Generalizable and Scalable
Actor-Critic), a framework that couples causal representation learning with
meta actor-critic learning to achieve both scalability and domain
generalization. Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that
provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its
dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations
(ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating
value functions to $\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on
graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source
domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few
trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted
policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic
convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and
significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation
baselines.

Motivation: 现有决策变换器及其变体存在标记冗余和二次注意力复杂度问题，限制了在实时或资源受限场景中的可扩展性。

Method: 提出统一标记表示（UTR），将回报-到-未来、状态和动作合并为单一标记，并基于Transformer与门控CNN构建了UDT和UDC两种变体。

Result: UTR理论上有更紧的Rademacher复杂度界，UDT和UDC在性能上媲美或超越SOTA方法，同时显著降低计算开销。

Conclusion: UTR在不同架构中表现良好，为未来大规模决策模型提供了高效可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in
future large decision models.

Conclusion: ParaRNN打破了非线性RNN的并行瓶颈，为高效序列建模提供了新范式，并开源代码推动后续研究。

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.

Result: 在TripAdvisor的餐厅数据集上验证了方法的有效性，成功预测了用户拍摄的照片并与推荐结合。

Conclusion: 用照片作为解释信号可提升推荐系统的透明度与可靠性，同时为商家提供直观的用户反馈洞察。

Abstract: Explaining the output of a complex system, such as a Recommender System (RS),
is becoming of utmost importance for both users and companies. In this paper we
explore the idea that personalized explanations can be learned as
recommendation themselves. There are plenty of online services where users can
upload some photos, in addition to rating items. We assume that users take
these photos to reinforce or justify their opinions about the items. For this
reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that
image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item.
In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its
reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for
users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid
knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The
paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for
a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered
from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six
cities of different sizes.

Motivation: 现有方法假设已知暴露映射，但现实中常不成立；且未考虑同质性与处理分配机制交互导致的网络级协变量偏移，影响效应估计准确性。

Method: 提出HINet，融合图神经网络与领域对抗训练，无需已知暴露映射，同时抑制网络级协变量偏移的影响。

Result: 在合成与半合成网络数据集上的实证结果表明，HINet在估计异质处理效应上表现有效。

Conclusion: HINet为网络环境中处理效应估计提供了一种更现实且鲁棒的解决方案，突破了传统对暴露映射的依赖。

Abstract: Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects in network settings is complicated
by interference, meaning that the outcome of an instance can be influenced by
the treatment status of others. Existing causal machine learning approaches
usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a
given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is
often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the
tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment
mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to
inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been
explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel
method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training.
This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure
mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An
extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: ZEN通过无参数、线性设计实现了高效、准确且可解释的少样本超图节点分类，为超图学习提供新范式。

Abstract: Few-shot node classification on hypergraphs requires models that generalize
from scarce labels while capturing high-order structures. Existing hypergraph
neural networks (HNNs) effectively encode such structures but often suffer from
overfitting and scalability issues due to complex, black-box architectures. In
this work, we propose ZEN (Zero-Parameter Hypergraph Neural Network), a fully
linear and parameter-free model that achieves both expressiveness and
efficiency. Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces
a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware
propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self
information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently
outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up

Motivation: 灾难性遗忘在联邦学习中对非独立同分布时间序列数据的回归预测任务影响显著，但现有研究多集中于视觉分类，缺乏对物联网和边缘计算中时间序列预测的探索。

Method: 基于北京多站点空气质量数据集，在12个去中心化客户端上评估Replay、EWC、LwF和Synaptic Intelligence等CF缓解方法。

Conclusion: 本工作为联邦时间序列预测中的持续学习提供了关键工具与洞察，推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a persistent challenge in continual
learning (CL), especially within federated learning (FL) environments
characterized by non-i.i.d. time series data. While existing research has
largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based
forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework
tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting.
Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized
clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including
Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic
Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF
in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of
state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source
framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing
continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.

*Tanmay Devale,Pramith Devulapalli,Steve Hanneke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文扩展了均匀均值估计的理论框架，提出UME可学习性，证明可分性是充分非必要条件，并解决了一个关于可数并集可学习性的猜想。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作如Vapnik-Chervonenkis的P-Glivenko-Cantelli仅基于经验均值估计，无法涵盖任意估计器的均匀估计能力，需建立更一般的理论框架。

Method: 在分布均值向量构成的空间中，引入UME可学习性概念，通过可分性分析和反例构造，结合全新技术证明非可分情况下仍可实现均匀估计。

Result: 可分性是UME可学习性的充分条件但非必要；构造了非可分但UME可学习的实例；证明了可数个UME可学习集合的并仍可学习。

Conclusion: UME可学习性提供了比传统经验均值更强的均匀估计理论，突破了可分性约束，并解决了开放性猜想，为分布族的均匀估计奠定了新基础。

Abstract: We characterize conditions under which collections of distributions on
$\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ admit uniform estimation of their mean. Prior work from
Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) has focused on uniform convergence using the
empirical mean estimator, leading to the principle known as $P-$
Glivenko-Cantelli. We extend this framework by moving beyond the empirical mean
estimator and introducing Uniform Mean Estimability, also called $UME-$
learnability, which captures when a collection permits uniform mean estimation
by any arbitrary estimator. We work on the space created by the mean vectors of
the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records
the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean
vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show
that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability
by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are
non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different
from those used in our separability-based analysis. Finally, we establish that
countable unions of $UME-$ learnable collections are also $UME-$ learnable,
solving a conjecture posed in Cohen et al. (2025).

Motivation: 奖励函数通常从噪声数据中近似估计，导致策略存在认知不确定性，需量化以提升可靠性。

Method: 使用小规模流网络集成训练多项式混沌展开代理模型，建模奖励函数与策略分布间的低维关系，并通过蒙特卡洛采样估算不确定性。

Result: 在离散与连续网格世界、符号回归和贝叶斯结构学习任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效、低成本地量化策略不确定性，适用于复杂生成任务中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Generative flow networks are able to sample, via sequential construction,
high-reward, complex objects according to a reward function. However, such
reward functions are often estimated approximately from noisy data, leading to
epistemic uncertainty in the learnt policy. We present an approach to quantify
this uncertainty by constructing a surrogate model composed of a polynomial
chaos expansion, fit on a small ensemble of trained flow networks. This model
learns the relationship between reward functions, parametrised in a
low-dimensional space, and the probability distributions over actions at each
step along a trajectory of the flow network. The surrogate model can then be
used for inexpensive Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the uncertainty in the
policy given uncertain rewards. We illustrate the performance of our approach
on a discrete and continuous grid-world, symbolic regression, and a Bayesian
structure learning task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化方法扩展性差且依赖领域知识，现有DRL方法为单任务设计，无法适应动态灾后需求

Method: 采用Transformer编码器-解码器架构，结合轻量级适配器机制，训练统一模型并支持微调以适应新属性

Result: 相比独立模型，训练时间和参数减少8倍；性能超越单任务DRL 6-14%，超越传统优化方法24-82%；1-10秒内解决千节点网络问题

Conclusion: UM实现了高效、高质量且自适应的无人机灾后评估路径规划，推动神经组合优化在应急响应中的应用

Abstract: Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response,
enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation
of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,
routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional
optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,
requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to
evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone
routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single
neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared
structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a
modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter
mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without
retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and
parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while
consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\% and traditional
optimization approaches by 24--82\% in terms of solution quality (total
collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10
seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed
through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen
attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining
high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial
optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally
efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.

TL;DR: 基于探针的训练方法在减少毒性方面表现良好，且优于分类器方法；重训练探针比使用探针集合更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探针可用于检测模型内部的不良行为，但作为训练目标时可能失效（Goodhart定律），需探索如何在训练中保持探针的可靠性。

Method: 采用监督微调和直接偏好优化两种方法，通过探针训练模型，并测试探针准确性下降情况，比较探针集合、保留测试探针和重训练探针的效果。

Result: 偏好优化比分类器方法更能保留探针检测能力；探针多样性提升有限，重训练探针即可恢复高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 基于探针的训练在特定对齐任务中可行，重训练探针比构建探针集合更实用，探针多样性非必需。

Abstract: Probes trained on model activations can detect undesirable behaviors like
deception or biases that are difficult to identify from outputs alone. This
makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also
valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good
internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against
interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a
training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two
methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct
Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in
a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy
drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors
after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2)
retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new
probes after training.
  First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe
detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference
learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant
representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit -
simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy.
Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment
methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is
feasible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有弱监督视频异常检测模型易受对抗攻击，传统对抗训练因视频级标签限制无效，而直接使用噪声伪标签也损害性能。

Method: 引入Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD)，对正常视频局部区域施加强增强以生成精确标注的合成异常，联合噪声伪标签降低标签噪声，实现有效对抗训练。

Result: 在多个基准上平均提升71.0% AUROC性能，显著优于当前SOTA方法。

Conclusion: SRD方法有效缓解弱监督下的标签噪声问题，为对抗训练提供可靠伪标签，大幅增强模型对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection (WSVAD) has achieved notable
advancements, yet existing models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
limiting their reliability. Due to the inherent constraints of weak
supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for
frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as
adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial
perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation,
pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level
adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy,
significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel
Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD),
which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized
regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating
these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels
substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\% in overall AUROC performance
across multiple benchmarks. The implementation and code are publicly available
at https://github.com/rohban-lab/FrameShield.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新度量Excision Score（ES），通过排除共享内容聚焦于修订差异，显著提升代码修订评估的准确性，超越BLEU、SARI等传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有度量（如BLEU）受共享内容主导，无法准确反映人类对修订差异的判断，亟需一种更契合人类评估的修订相似性度量。

Method: 提出Excision Score（ES），利用LCS去除原文档与预测/真实修订中的共享部分，仅比较差异区域，并通过近似算法将复杂度从O(n³)降至O(n²)。

Result: 在HumanEvalFix上，ES比SARI提升12%皮尔逊相关性，比BLEU提升超21%；在增加共享上下文扰动下，优势进一步扩大至20%和30%以上，且能正确处理代码块移动、插入/删除等边界情况。

Conclusion: ES通过‘切除’共享内容聚焦差异，首次实现对修订相似性的精准评估，为代码与文本修订评估提供了更可靠的新标准。

Abstract: Many tasks revolve around editing a document, whether code or text. We
formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine
learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing
document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an
existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a
majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision
similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that
popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because
their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity
between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is
a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision
Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content
shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions,
before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a
surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use
approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In
code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy
for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When
aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest
competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures
like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb
HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases
to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that
other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and
appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.

Motivation: 解决SAGIN-MEC在低空经济中面临的异构节点协同、动态环境建模与实时决策挑战。

Method: 构建分层SAGIN-MEC架构，建立UD成本最小化优化问题（UCMOP），提出MADDPG-COCG算法，结合多智能体强化学习、凸优化与博弈论处理混合决策。

Result: 相比基准算法，MADDPG-COCG显著降低UD成本、任务延迟和能耗，略有增加UAV能耗，且收敛稳定、可扩展性强。

Conclusion: MADDPG-COCG有效应对SAGIN-MEC复杂动态环境，为低空经济提供高效智能的边缘计算解决方案。

Abstract: Space-air-ground integrated multi-access edge computing (SAGIN-MEC) provides
a promising solution for the rapidly developing low-altitude economy (LAE) to
deliver flexible and wide-area computing services. However, fully realizing the
potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including
coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,
modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling
real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid
variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical
SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices
(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD
cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by
jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,
computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an
NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep
deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game
(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to
optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the
partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex
optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional
MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional
decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG
algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the
aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a
slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark
algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence
stability and scalability.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is essential for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis, but current automated systems often struggle with
transparency and generalization to unseen conditions. To address this, we
introduce ZETA, a zero-shot multimodal framework designed for interpretable ECG
diagnosis aligned with clinical workflows. ZETA uniquely compares ECG signals
against structured positive and negative clinical observations, which are
curated through an LLM-assisted, expert-validated process, thereby mimicking
differential diagnosis. Our approach leverages a pre-trained multimodal model
to align ECG and text embeddings without disease-specific fine-tuning.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate ZETA's competitive zero-shot classification
performance and, importantly, provide qualitative and quantitative evidence of
enhanced interpretability, grounding predictions in specific, clinically
relevant positive and negative diagnostic features. ZETA underscores the
potential of aligning ECG analysis with structured clinical knowledge for
building more transparent, generalizable, and trustworthy AI diagnostic
systems. We will release the curated observation dataset and code to facilitate
future research.

Conclusion: 将经典算法先验嵌入GNN能提供有效归纳偏置，显著提升复杂真实图数据的性能

Abstract: Neural networks excel at processing unstructured data but often fail to
generalise out-of-distribution, whereas classical algorithms guarantee
correctness but lack flexibility. We explore whether pretraining Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) on classical algorithms can improve their performance on
molecular property prediction tasks from the Open Graph Benchmark: ogbg-molhiv
(HIV inhibition) and ogbg-molclintox (clinical toxicity). GNNs trained on 24
classical algorithms from the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark are used to
initialise and freeze selected layers of a second GNN for molecular prediction.
Compared to a randomly initialised baseline, the pretrained models achieve
consistent wins or ties, with the Segments Intersect algorithm pretraining
yielding a 6% absolute gain on ogbg-molhiv and Dijkstra pretraining achieving a
3% gain on ogbg-molclintox. These results demonstrate embedding classical
algorithmic priors into GNNs provides useful inductive biases, boosting
performance on complex, real-world graph data.

Conclusion: 深度网络通过层次化密度结构编码语义，冗余表征在正则化下是泛化的关键，突破传统过拟合认知。

Abstract: The goal of this thesis is to improve our understanding of the internal
mechanisms by which deep artificial neural networks create meaningful
representations and are able to generalize. We focus on the challenge of
characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with
unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this
thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data.
Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic
dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing
any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous
distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the
estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since
it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we
study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some
state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate
a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to
classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical
fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process
leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the
topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the
categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural
networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data
will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the
classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn
redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and
that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the
training error is zero.

Conclusion: REVE显著推动EEG基础模型发展，开源代码、权重和教程将促进临床神经科学的标准化研究和进步。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed AI by reducing reliance on task-specific
data through large-scale pretraining. While successful in language and vision,
their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets,
which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode
configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across
these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in
suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE
(Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model
explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a
novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of
arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding
objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets
spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to
date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks,
including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging,
cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no
fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal
modeling. We release code, pretrained weights, and tutorials to support
standardized EEG research and accelerate progress in clinical neuroscience.

Conclusion: HOPSS显著降低数据生成时间复杂度，为神经算子提供高效数据生成范式，兼具效率与精度

Abstract: Data-driven deep learning methods like neural operators have advanced in
solving nonlinear temporal partial differential equations (PDEs). However,
these methods require large quantities of solution pairs\u2014the solution
functions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are
typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of
time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating
heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in
Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer
time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large
time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset
generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.
Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable
solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps
with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a "homologous
perturbation" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary
function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar)
with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data
points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the
original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and
experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the
Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of
traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.

Motivation: SHAP在神经网络等复杂模型中计算困难（NP-hard），而张量网络作为神经网络的抽象与压缩工具，其SHAP计算尚未系统研究。

Method: 建立通用TNs的精确SHAP计算框架，重点分析TT结构的poly-log并行算法，并通过归约将结果推广至决策树、线性模型、RNN及二值神经网络。

Result: TT结构下SHAP可并行poly-log时间计算，且对固定宽度的二值神经网络高效可解，而深度固定仍为NP-hard，揭示宽度是主要计算瓶颈。

Conclusion: 张量网络为SHAP计算提供了新视角，TT结构显著提升效率，宽度成为关键复杂性因素，为高效可解释AI设计提供理论基础。

Abstract: Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.

Abstract: Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.

Result: 方法高效且能精确复现从成对到高阶的相关性，弥补了现有技术的缺陷。

Conclusion: GCM为隐私保护数据共享、鲁棒模型训练和仿真提供了新范式。

Abstract: The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.

Conclusion: 反事实解释能高效 probing 教师模型决策边界，在少样本场景下实现更精准的知识迁移，为资源受限的蒸馏提供新范式。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在分布外场景中因脆弱性受限，亟需高效可靠的异常检测方法。

Method: DEEDEE提出双统计量检测器： Episode-wise均值和RBF核相似度，分别捕捉全局与局部偏差，摒弃复杂表征流水线。

Result: DEEDEE在标准RL OOD基准上性能媲美或超越现有方法，计算开销降低600倍，准确率提升5%。

Conclusion: RL轨迹中的异常常由少数低阶统计量表征，暗示复杂环境中OOD检测可基于简约统计框架实现。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical settings is
constrained by brittleness under distribution shift. We study
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection for RL time series and introduce DEEDEE, a
two-statistic detector that revisits representation-heavy pipelines with a
minimal alternative. DEEDEE uses only an episodewise mean and an RBF kernel
similarity to a training summary, capturing complementary global and local
deviations. Despite its simplicity, DEEDEE matches or surpasses contemporary
detectors across standard RL OOD suites, delivering a 600-fold reduction in
compute (FLOPs / wall-time) and an average 5% absolute accuracy gain over
strong baselines. Conceptually, our results indicate that diverse anomaly types
often imprint on RL trajectories through a small set of low-order statistics,
suggesting a compact foundation for OOD detection in complex environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM)，揭示其在聚类误差率上的理论极限，证明即使边缘密度信号消失，聚类仍可实现，并表明使用k²个特征向量的谱聚类优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型如SBM和DCBM无法捕捉集群内与集群间连接的差异化受欢迎度，导致聚类性能受限。

Method: 引入PABM模型，通过分离内外聚类的受欢迎参数，分析其聚类误差率的理论极限，并验证基于k²个特征向量的谱嵌入方法。

Result: PABM下聚类在边缘密度趋近零时仍可恢复；谱方法使用k²而非k个特征向量显著提升性能。

Conclusion: PABM捕获了DCBM忽略的局部连通性异质性，为图聚类提供了更精细的理论框架与更优的算法路径。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of graph clustering under the
Popularity-Adjusted Block Model (PABM), addressing limitations of existing
models. In contrast to the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), which assumes uniform
vertex degrees, and to the Degree-Corrected Block Model (DCBM), which applies
uniform degree corrections across clusters, PABM introduces separate popularity
parameters for intra- and inter-cluster connections. Our main contribution is
the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which
provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM
and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional
edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity
coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity
captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity
patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge
densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected
adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of
clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors
may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments
on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms
incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.

Method: 提出理论框架，推导等变条件下ECE和ENCE的上下界，结合数值实验验证对称性失配、群大小及 Aleatoric/Epistemic 不确定性的影响。

Result: 证明等变性可降低不确定性校准误差，但对称性不匹配会显著加剧校准偏差；实验验证了模型置信度随对称性匹配度变化的规律。

Conclusion: 等变性有助于提升不确定性校准，但必须匹配数据对称性，否则会导致模型过自信；为等变模型的可靠部署提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Result: 发现模型自动生成边界检测器、聚类敏感特征和几何分割器，无需显式监督。

Conclusion: 首次揭示神经TSP求解器内部的几何结构，为可解释混合系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with
Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling
Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black
boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the
heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by
applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique,
to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of
activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We
train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then
fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete
dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver
naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary
detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features
responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric
partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what
neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric
structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward
transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic
interpretability. Interactive feature explorer:

Conclusion: EbC是首个无需组先验的通用等变学习框架，为计算机视觉中的仿射等变建模提供新途径，未来可扩展至真实数据。

Abstract: We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings
from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn
from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent
space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to
invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases.
We validate our approach on the infinite dSprites dataset with structured
transformations defined by the finite group $G:= (R_m \times \mathbb{Z}_n
\times \mathbb{Z}_n)$, combining discrete rotations and periodic translations.
The resulting embeddings exhibit high-fidelity equivariance, with group
operations faithfully reproduced in latent space. On synthetic data, we further
validate the approach on the non-abelian orthogonal group $O(n)$ and the
general linear group $GL(n)$. We also provide a theoretical proof for
identifiability. While broad evaluation across diverse group types on
real-world data remains future work, our results constitute the first
successful demonstration of general-purpose encoder-only equivariant learning
from group action observations alone, including non-trivial non-abelian groups
and a product group motivated by modeling affine equivariances in computer
vision.

Motivation: 因果表示学习（CRL）在理论与实际应用间存在差距，机器人领域作为CRL的原始动机，亟需实用化解决方案。

Method: 提出ROPES方法，利用机器人执行器干预产生的图像分布变化，通过分数模型识别可操控的潜在因子（如关节角度），实现无监督因果解缠。

Result: 在半合成机械臂实验中，ROPES无需标签数据即可高保真地恢复真实潜在因子，性能优于半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 机器人位姿估计可作为接近实用的CRL测试平台，推动因果表示学习从理论走向现实应用。

Abstract: Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised
framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying
high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among
the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in
identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between
theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap
by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,
this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of
position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose
Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES
embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative
factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic
latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,
and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the
controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated
(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that
variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In
robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various
joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in
semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully
disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the
ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional
changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison
with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This
paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical
testbed for CRL.

Abstract: Robotic suturing is a prototypical long-horizon dexterous manipulation task,

We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci

that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting
accuracy by 59\%-74\% over a task-only baseline. To establish this task as a

Autonomous suturing is a key milestone toward achieving robotic autonomy in

Result: PPC在多种机器人任务中显著提升对未知相机位姿的鲁棒性，优于领域随机化方法

Conclusion: PPC为点云强化学习提供了一种系统性、对抗视角变化的规范化解决方案

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from raw visual input has achieved impressive
successes in recent years, yet it remains fragile to out-of-distribution
variations such as changes in lighting, color, and viewpoint. Point Cloud
Reinforcement Learning (PC-RL) offers a promising alternative by mitigating
appearance-based brittleness, but its sensitivity to camera pose mismatches
continues to undermine reliability in realistic settings. To address this
challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework
specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds
under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning
observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing
viewpoint-induced inconsistencies. In our experiments, we show that PPC
improves robustness to unseen camera poses across challenging robotic tasks,
providing a principled alternative to domain randomization.

Abstract: We introduce a novel system for human-to-robot trajectory transfer that
enables robots to manipulate objects by learning from human demonstration
videos. The system consists of four modules. The first module is a data
collection module that is designed to collect human demonstration videos from
the point of view of a robot using an AR headset. The second module is a video
understanding module that detects objects and extracts 3D human-hand
trajectories from demonstration videos. The third module transfers a human-hand
trajectory into a reference trajectory of a robot end-effector in 3D space. The
last module utilizes a trajectory optimization algorithm to solve a trajectory
in the robot configuration space that can follow the end-effector trajectory
transferred from the human demonstration. Consequently, these modules enable a
robot to watch a human demonstration video once and then repeat the same mobile
manipulation task in different environments, even when objects are placed
differently from the demonstrations. Experiments of different manipulation
tasks are conducted on a mobile manipulator to verify the effectiveness of our
system

Abstract: Learning from demonstration is effective for teaching robots complex skills
with high sample efficiency. However, teaching long-horizon tasks with multiple
skills is difficult, as deviations accumulate, distributional shift increases,
and human teachers become fatigued, raising the chance of failure. In this
work, we study user responses to two teaching frameworks: (i) a traditional
monolithic approach, where users demonstrate the entire trajectory of a
long-horizon task; and (ii) a sequential approach, where the task is segmented
by the user and demonstrations are provided step by step. To support this
study, we introduce $(ST)^2$, a sequential method for learning long-horizon
manipulation tasks that allows users to control the teaching flow by defining
key points, enabling incremental and structured demonstrations. We conducted a
user study on a restocking task with 16 participants in a realistic retail
environment to evaluate both user preference and method effectiveness. Our
objective and subjective results show that both methods achieve similar
trajectory quality and success rates. Some participants preferred the
sequential approach for its iterative control, while others favored the
monolithic approach for its simplicity.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新的反应式重规划方法，避免更新现有计划，改用快速渐近最优规划算法解决动态环境中的路径规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反应式重规划依赖更新密集规划图，计算成本高且变更检测困难，亟需更高效的方法。

Method: 提出将增量规划转化为一系列独立问题，采用快速渐近几乎必然最优（ASAO）算法（如EIT*和AORRTC），无需显式重用计划即可收敛到高质量路径。

Result: 仿真中EIT*比现有反应式算法找到更短的中位路径，真实机械臂实验验证了AORRTC的有效性。

Conclusion: 无需更新旧计划的ASAO算法在动态环境中更高效，为反应式规划提供了新范式。

Abstract: Robots operating in changing environments either predict obstacle changes
and/or plan quickly enough to react to them. Predictive approaches require a
strong prior about the position and motion of obstacles. Reactive approaches
require no assumptions about their environment but must replan quickly and find
high-quality paths to navigate effectively.
  Reactive approaches often reuse information between queries to reduce
planning cost. These techniques are conceptually sound but updating dense
planning graphs when information changes can be computationally prohibitive. It
can also require significant effort to detect the changes in some applications.
  This paper revisits the long-held assumption that reactive replanning
requires updating existing plans. It shows that the incremental planning
problem can alternatively be solved more efficiently as a series of independent
problems using fast almost-surely asymptotically optimal (ASAO) planning
algorithms. These ASAO algorithms quickly find an initial solution and converge
towards an optimal solution which allows them to find consistent global plans
in the presence of changing obstacles without requiring explicit plan reuse.
This is demonstrated with simulated experiments where Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*) finds shorter median solution paths than the tested reactive planning
algorithms and is further validated using Asymptotically Optimal RRT-Connect
(AORRTC) on a real-world planning problem on a robot arm.

TL;DR: GSL框架通过对象中心技能连接视觉语言模型与视觉运动策略，显著提升机器人操作的泛化能力和样本效率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有层次策略学习在未见过的空间布局、物体外观和任务组合上泛化能力差且样本效率低。

Method: 使用基础模型将演示分解为可迁移且对象规范化的技能基元，高层代理预测技能-对象对，底层模块将其映射回世界坐标系执行。

Conclusion: GSL通过结构化技能接口实现高效泛化，是机器人操作中样本高效学习的有效路径。

Abstract: We present Generalizable Hierarchical Skill Learning (GSL), a novel framework
for hierarchical policy learning that significantly improves policy
generalization and sample efficiency in robot manipulation. One core idea of
GSL is to use object-centric skills as an interface that bridges the high-level
vision-language model and the low-level visual-motor policy. Specifically, GSL
decomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill
primitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning
in the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the
high-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical
actions are mapped back to the world frame for execution. This structured yet
flexible design leads to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and
generalization of our method across unseen spatial arrangements, object
appearances, and task compositions. In simulation, GSL trained with only 3
demonstrations per task outperforms baselines trained with 30 times more data
by 15.5 percent on unseen tasks. In real-world experiments, GSL also surpasses
the baseline trained with 10 times more data.

TL;DR: 提出一种动态超球钳制的控制器，实现模块化机器人在月球环境下的安全自适应运动控制，两种变体均表现出高鲁棒性和精度。

Motivation: 月球任务需要模块化机器人具备可重构性和容错性，但现有控制器难以安全应对真实世界干扰。

Method: 基于Motion Stack的硬件无关驱动同步，提出动态超球钳制方法，仅利用末端执行器与目标位姿实现实时自适应速度边界调整，设计离散步进与连续速度两种变体。

Result: 离散变体运动可预测、低抖动；连续变体收敛快、定位精度达毫米级；两者在不同机械缺陷和传感噪声下均表现鲁棒。

Conclusion: 该框架具有机器人无关性，在恶劣环境下仍能可靠支持自主组装与重构。

Abstract: Modular robots offer reconfigurability and fault tolerance essential for
lunar missions, but require controllers that adapt safely to real-world
disturbances. We build on our previous hardware-agnostic actuator
synchronization in Motion Stack to develop a new controller enforcing adaptive
velocity bounds via a dynamic hypersphere clamp. Using only real-time
end-effector and target pose measurements, the controller adjusts its
translational and rotational speed limits to ensure smooth, stable alignment
without abrupt motions. We implemented two variants, a discrete, step-based
version and a continuous, velocity-based version, and tested them on two
MoonBot limbs in JAXA's lunar environment simulator. Field trials demonstrate
that the step-based variant produces highly predictable, low-wobble motions,
while the continuous variant converges more quickly and maintains
millimeter-level positional accuracy, and both remain robust across limbs with
differing mechanical imperfections and sensing noise (e.g., backlash and flex).
These results highlight the flexibility and robustness of our robot-agnostic
framework for autonomous self-assembly and reconfiguration under harsh
conditions.

Conclusion: 多模态融合是解决水下SLAM视觉退化问题的有效路径，所提方法为复杂水下环境中的高鲁棒性定位提供了新范式。

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by limited visibility, insufficient lighting, and
feature scarcity in underwater environments presents significant challenges to
visual-inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a graph-based
visual-inertial-acoustic-depth SLAM system that integrates a stereo camera, an
inertial measurement unit (IMU), the Doppler velocity log (DVL), and a pressure
sensor. The key innovation lies in the tight integration of four distinct
sensor modalities to ensure reliable operation, even under degraded visual
conditions. To mitigate DVL drift and improve measurement efficiency, we
propose a novel velocity-bias-based DVL preintegration strategy. At the
frontend, hybrid tracking strategies and acoustic-inertial-depth joint
optimization enhance system stability. Additionally, multi-source hybrid
residuals are incorporated into a graph optimization framework. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative analyses of the proposed system are conducted in
both simulated and real-world underwater scenarios. The results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art stereo visual-inertial
SLAM systems in both stability and localization accuracy, exhibiting
exceptional robustness, particularly in visually challenging environments.

Motivation: 传统手动操作无人机需要专业飞行员，尤其在无GNSS环境和复杂结构附近操作困难，而现有自主系统因需专用接口、定制传感器和强算力硬件而难以普及。

Method: 利用消费级DJI无人机，开发运行于遥控器上的Android应用实现轻量级状态估计与避障，构建地面站系统以协同管理多架无人机并融合其观测数据生成联合3D环境模型。

Result: 实现无需改装硬件的自主飞行，支持单人操控多机协同，提升复杂环境下的态势感知能力。

Conclusion: 该系统降低了自主无人机部署门槛，提升了应急响应中无人机的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: In recent years, consumer-grade UAVs have been widely adopted by first
responders. In general, they are operated manually, which requires trained
pilots, especially in unknown GNSS-denied environments and in the vicinity of
structures. Autonomous flight can facilitate the application of UAVs and reduce
operator strain. However, autonomous systems usually require special
programming interfaces, custom sensor setups, and strong onboard computers,
which limits a broader deployment.
  We present a system for autonomous flight using lightweight consumer-grade
DJI drones. They are controlled by an Android app for state estimation and
obstacle avoidance directly running on the UAV's remote control. Our ground
control station enables a single operator to configure and supervise multiple
heterogeneous UAVs at once. Furthermore, it combines the observations of all
UAVs into a joint 3D environment model for improved situational awareness.

Result: 在定制塌陷平台和岩石地形上实验验证，机器人能安全穿越塌陷区域并保持稳定。

Conclusion: 该框架无需硬件改造，显著提升四足机器人在未知不稳定地形中的自主安全通行能力。

Abstract: Collapsing terrains, often present in search and rescue missions or planetary
exploration, pose significant challenges for quadruped robots. This paper
introduces a robust locomotion framework for safe navigation over unstable
surfaces by integrating terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion
planning, and control strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
specialized sensors or external terrain mapping alone, our approach leverages
joint measurements to assess terrain stability without hardware modifications.
A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system optimizes robot motion, balancing
stability and probing constraints, while a state machine coordinates terrain
probing actions, enabling the robot to detect collapsible regions and
dynamically adjust its footholds. Experimental results on custom-made
collapsing platforms and rocky terrains demonstrate the framework's ability to
traverse collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing
safety.

Conclusion: PREVENT系统可无缝集成至现有架构，显著增强化学机器人自主性与安全性，推动实验室自动化发展。

Abstract: Mobile robotic chemists are a fast growing trend in the field of chemistry
and materials research. However, so far these mobile robots lack workflow
awareness skills. This poses the risk that even a small anomaly, such as an
improperly capped sample vial could disrupt the entire workflow. This wastes
time, and resources, and could pose risks to human researchers, such as
exposure to toxic materials. Existing perception mechanisms can be used to
predict anomalies but they often generate excessive false positives. This may
halt workflow execution unnecessarily, requiring researchers to intervene and
to resume the workflow when no problem actually exists, negating the benefits
of autonomous operation. To address this problem, we propose PREVENT a system
comprising navigation and manipulation skills based on a multimodal Behavior
Tree (BT) approach that can be integrated into existing software architectures
with minimal modifications. Our approach involves a hierarchical perception
mechanism that exploits AI techniques and sensory feedback through Dexterous
Vision and Navigational Vision cameras and an IoT gas sensor module for
execution-related decision-making. Experimental evaluations show that the
proposed approach is comparatively efficient and completely avoids both false
negatives and false positives when tested in simulated risk scenarios within
our robotic chemistry workflow. The results also show that the proposed
multi-modal perception skills achieved deployment accuracies that were higher
than the average of the corresponding uni-modal skills, both for navigation and
for manipulation.

Conclusion: 增强机器人的韧性可显著提高其在老年照护等场景中的接受度与实用性

Abstract: As artificial intelligence continues to advance and becomes more integrated
into sensitive areas like healthcare, education, and everyday life, it's
crucial for these systems to be both resilient and robust. This paper shows how
resilience is a fundamental characteristic of social robots, which, through it,
ensure trust in the robot itself-an essential element especially when operating
in contexts with elderly people, who often have low trust in these systems.
Resilience is therefore the ability to operate under adverse or stressful
conditions, even when degraded or weakened, while maintaining essential
operational capabilities.

Motivation: 现有模型在室内和结构化环境中因多尺度处理不足、边界优化差和特征表示有限，导致地平面分割效果不佳。

Method: 采用CSP-Darknet主干，引入残差边界优化模块(RBRM)和注意力渐进上采样解码器(APUD)，并结合轻量级ASPP-Lite模块进行多尺度上下文提取。

Result: 在GMRP和自定义Gazebo数据集上，mIoU提升1.26%，分割精度提升1.65%，超越现有模型且保持实时性能。

Conclusion: AURASeg在室内外环境中均能实现高精度边界优化，适用于自动驾驶与机器人感知系统。

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous
vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained
features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for
robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from
ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited
feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose
Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement
(AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high
segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses
CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for
accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder
(APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous
Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context
extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats
benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the
Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor
dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union
(mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to
state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for
autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise
border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: 稀疏触觉信号对操作灵巧性至关重要，SSL与记忆解耦可显著提升性能，RoTO基准将推动触觉操作研究。

Abstract: Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to
evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory
deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential,
the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains
inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL)
methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a
scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically
demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity,
particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not
register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman
dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation).
Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory
can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark
to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation.

Abstract: Micro aerial vehicles are becoming increasingly important in search and
rescue operations due to their agility, speed, and ability to access confined
spaces or hazardous areas. However, designing lightweight aerial systems
presents significant structural, aerodynamic, and computational challenges.
This work addresses two key limitations in many low-cost aerial systems under
two kilograms: their lack of structural durability during flight through rough
terrains and inability to replan paths dynamically when new victims or
obstacles are detected. We present a fully customised drone built from scratch
using only commonly available components and materials, emphasising modularity,
low cost, and ease of assembly. The structural frame is reinforced with
lightweight yet durable materials to withstand impact, while the onboard
control system is powered entirely by free, open-source software solutions. The
proposed system demonstrates real-time perception and adaptive navigation
capabilities without relying on expensive hardware accelerators, offering an
affordable and practical solution for real-world search and rescue missions.
