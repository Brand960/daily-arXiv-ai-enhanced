While visible-light methods address HR and BR, they cannot access EDA, a standard marker of sympathetic activation. This paper characterizes the extraction of these three biosignals from facial thermal video using a signal-processing pipeline that tracks anatomical regions, applies spatial aggregation, and separates slow sudomotor trends from faster cardiorespiratory components. For HR, we apply an orthogonal matrix image transformation (OMIT) decomposition across multiple facial regions of interest (ROIs), and for BR we average nasal and cheek signals before spectral peak detection. We evaluate 288 EDA configurations and the HR/BR pipeline on 31 sessions from the public SIMULATOR STUDY 1 (SIM1) driver monitoring dataset. The best fixed EDA configuration (nose region, exponential moving average) reaches a mean absolute correlation of $0.40 \\pm 0.23$ against palm EDA, with individual sessions reaching 0.89. BR estimation achieves a mean absolute error of $3.1 \\pm 1.1$ bpm, while HR estimation yields $13.8 \\pm 7.5$ bpm MAE, limited by the low camera frame rate (7.5 Hz). We report signal polarity alternation across sessions, short thermodynamic latency for well-tracked signals, and condition-dependent and demographic effects on extraction quality.

However, the development of models that unify motion-language generation and understanding remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches often fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on paired motion-text data, which can result in catastrophic forgetting of linguistic capabilities due to the limited scale of available text-motion pairs. Furthermore, prior methods typically convert motion into discrete representations via quantization to integrate with language models, introducing substantial jitter artifacts from discrete tokenization. To address these challenges, we propose LLaMo, a unified framework that extends pretrained LLMs through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. This design inherently preserves the language understanding of the base model while enabling scalable multimodal adaptation. We encode human motion into a causal continuous latent space and maintain the next-token prediction paradigm in the decoder-only backbone through a lightweight flow-matching head, allowing for streaming motion generation in real-time (>30 FPS). Leveraging the comprehensive language understanding of pretrained LLMs and large-scale motion-text pretraining, our experiments demonstrate that LLaMo achieves high-fidelity text-to-motion generation and motion-to-text captioning in general settings, especially zero-shot motion generation, marking a significant step towards a general unified motion-language large model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLLaMo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548cMoT\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6587\u672c-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6587\u672c-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e14\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5165\u6296\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u5c5eMixture-of-Transformers\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301LLM\u7684next-token\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5934\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d41\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "LLaMo\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301>30 FPS\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "LLaMo\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8-\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u540c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Synthetic image detection (SID) has thus become an important area of research. Prior work has highlighted how synthetic images differ from real photographs--unfortunately, SID methods often struggle to generalize to novel generative models and often perform poorly in practical settings. CLIP, a foundational vision-language model which yields semantically rich image-text embeddings, shows strong accuracy and generalization for SID. Yet, the underlying relevant cues embedded in CLIP-features remain unknown. It is unclear, whether CLIP-based detectors simply detect strong visual artifacts or exploit subtle semantic biases, both of which would render them useless in practical settings or on generative models of high quality. We introduce SynthCLIC, a paired dataset of real photographs and high-quality synthetic counterparts from recent diffusion models, designed to reduce semantic bias in SID. Using an interpretable linear head with de-correlated activations and a text-grounded concept-model, we analyze what CLIP-based detectors learn. CLIP-based linear detectors reach 0.96 mAP on a GAN-based benchmark but only 0.92 on our high-quality diffusion dataset SynthCLIC, and generalization across generator families drops to as low as 0.37 mAP. We find that the detectors primarily rely on high-level photographic attributes (e.g., minimalist style, lens flare, or depth layering), rather than overt generator-specific artifacts. CLIP-based detectors perform well overall but generalize unevenly across diverse generative architectures. This highlights the need for continual model updates and broader training exposure, while reinforcing CLIP-based approaches as a strong foundation for more universal, robust SID.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLIP-based\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u7ea7\u6444\u5f71\u5c5e\u6027\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0e\u66f4\u5e7f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7a76CLIP\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u771f\u6b63\u5229\u7528\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaSynthCLIC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u914d\u5bf9\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7ebf\u6027\u5934\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6982\u5ff5\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790CLIP\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "CLIP\u7ebf\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728GAN\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe0.96 mAP\uff0c\u4f46\u5728SynthCLIC\u4e0a\u964d\u81f30.92\uff0c\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u6cdb\u5316\u4f4e\u81f30.37 mAP\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6444\u5f71\u5c5e\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "conclusion": "CLIP\u662f\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f46\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u9700\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u5927\u8bad\u7ec3\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

We reproduce the main ablation studies on diffusion timestep selection, LoRA-based fine-tuning, mask regularization strength, and UNet feature supervision, and observe close agreement with the qualitative and quantitative trends reported in the original work. At the same time, our experiments show that performance is sensitive to a small number of hyperparameter assumptions, particularly the optimized timestep and the feature level used for motion supervision, while other components admit broader operating ranges.

Instead of distilling high-dimensional Vision-Language Model (VLM) embeddings using model-specific decoders, LatentAM proposes an online dictionary learning approach that is both model-agnostic and pretraining-free, enabling plug-and-play integration with different VLMs at test time. Specifically, our approach associates each Gaussian primitive with a compact query vector that can be converted into approximate VLM embeddings using an attention mechanism with a learnable dictionary. The dictionary is initialized efficiently from streaming observations and optimized online to adapt to evolving scene semantics under trust-region regularization. To scale to long trajectories and large environments, we further propose an efficient map management strategy based on voxel hashing, where optimization is restricted to an active local map on the GPU, while the global map is stored and indexed on the CPU to maintain bounded GPU memory usage. Experiments on public benchmarks and a large-scale custom dataset demonstrate that LatentAM attains significantly better feature reconstruction fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods, while achieving near-real-time speed (12-35 FPS) on the evaluated datasets.

Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "OptiML\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u5728CUDA\u5185\u6838\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "CUDA\u5185\u6838\u4f18\u5316\u9762\u4e34\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e9e\u5927\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u53cd\u9988\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u867d\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "OptiML\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1aOptiML-G\u57fa\u4e8eMixture-of-Thoughts\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u5185\u6838\uff0cOptiML-X\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Nsight Compute\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "OptiML\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3aLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0cOptiML\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdCUDA\u5185\u6838\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

End-to-end benchmark gains conflate multiple factors, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific skills. To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RL's reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not a uniform enhancement of visual perception, but a systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "RL\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5e76\u975e\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u540e\u671fTransformer\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206RL\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u9700\u660e\u786eRL\u5b9e\u9645\u6539\u5584\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFrankenstein\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u56e0\u679c\u63a2\u9488\u529f\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "RL\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u5f15\u53d1\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e14\u4e3a\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u975e\u6574\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e8e\u4e2d\u540e\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

With an imagined future observation, the VLA can focus on visuo-motor inference rather than high-level semantic reasoning, leading to improved accuracy and generalization. Our planner comprises a highly efficient foresight image generation module that predicts a high-quality 640$\\times$480 future observation from the current visual input and language instruction within only 0.33s on an H100 GPU, together with a vision-language model that reasons over the task and produces subtask descriptions for both the generator and the VLA.

While models typically follow these character specifications, they can occasionally violate them in large-scale deployments. In this work, we aim to identify types of queries that are likely to produce such character violations at deployment, using much less than deployment-level compute. To do this, we introduce abstractive red-teaming, where we search for natural-language query categories, e.g. \"The query is in Chinese. The query asks about family roles,\" that routinely elicit violations. These categories abstract over the many possible variants of a query which could appear in the wild. We introduce two algorithms for efficient category search against a character-trait-specific reward model: one based on reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM, and another which leverages a strong LLM to iteratively synthesize categories from high-scoring queries. Across a 12-principle character specification and 7 target models, we find that our algorithms consistently outperform baselines, and generate qualitatively interesting categories; for example, queries which ask Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to predict the future lead to responses saying that AI will dominate humanity, and queries that ask GPT-4.1-Mini for essential prison survival items lead to enthusiastic recommendation of illegal weapons.

In this paper, we identify spurious visual semantic correlations in existing generative ZSL worsened by scarce seen class samples and introduce two metrics to quantify spuriousness for seen and unseen classes. Furthermore, we point out a more critical bottleneck: existing unadaptive fully noised generators produce features disconnected from real test samples, which also leads to the spurious correlation. To enhance the visual-semantic correlations on both seen and unseen classes, we propose ZeroDiff++, a diffusion-based generative framework. In training, ZeroDiff++ uses (i) diffusion augmentation to produce diverse noised samples, (ii) supervised contrastive (SC) representations for instance level semantics, and (iii) multi view discriminators with Wasserstein mutual learning to assess generated features. At generation time, we introduce (iv) Diffusion-based Test time Adaptation (DiffTTA) to adapt the generator using pseudo label reconstruction, and (v) Diffusion-based Test time Generation (DiffGen) to trace the diffusion denoising path and produce partially synthesized features that connect real and generated data, and mitigates data scarcity further.

However, its high computational cost, dominated by repeated log-determinant evaluations, has limited its use in real-time planning. This letter presents Schur-MI, a Gaussian process (GP) MI formulation that (i) leverages the iterative structure of RIG to precompute and reuse expensive intermediate quantities across planning steps, and (ii) uses a Schur-complement factorization to avoid large determinant computations. Together, these methods reduce the per-evaluation cost of MI from $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{V}|^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{A}|^3)$, where $\\mathcal{V}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ denote the candidate and selected sensing locations, respectively. Experiments on real-world bathymetry datasets show that Schur-MI achieves up to a $12.7\\times$ speedup over the standard MI formulation.

These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found \"in the wild\" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool.

Hosseini"], "title": "MonoLoss: A Training Objective for Interpretable Monosemantic Representations", "comment": "Under Review", "summary": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose polysemantic neural representations, where neurons respond to multiple unrelated concepts, into monosemantic features that capture single, interpretable concepts. However, standard training objectives only weakly encourage this decomposition, and existing monosemanticity metrics require pairwise comparisons across all dataset samples, making them inefficient during training and evaluation. We study a recent MonoScore metric and derive a single-pass algorithm that computes exactly the same quantity, but with a cost that grows linearly, rather than quadratically, with the number of dataset images. On OpenImagesV7, we achieve up to a 1200x speedup wall-clock speedup in evaluation and 159x during training, while adding only ~4% per-epoch overhead. This allows us to treat MonoScore as a training signal: we introduce the Monosemanticity Loss (MonoLoss), a plug-in objective that directly rewards semantically consistent activations for learning interpretable monosemantic representations. Across SAEs trained on CLIP, SigLIP2, and pretrained ViT features, using BatchTopK, TopK, and JumpReLU SAEs, MonoLoss increases MonoScore for most latents. MonoLoss also consistently improves class purity (the fraction of a latent's activating images belonging to its dominant class) across all encoder and SAE combinations, with the largest gain raising baseline purity from 0.152 to 0.723. Used as an auxiliary regularizer during ResNet-50 and CLIP-ViT-B/32 finetuning, MonoLoss yields up to 0.6\\% accuracy gains on ImageNet-1K and monosemantic activating patterns on standard benchmark datasets.

Unlike existing single-turn paradigm, LongNav-R1 reformulates the navigation decision process as a continuous multi-turn conversation between the VLA policy and the embodied environment. This multi-turn RL framework offers two distinct advantages: i) it enables the agent to reason about the causal effects of historical interactions and sequential future outcomes; and ii) it allows the model to learn directly from online interactions, fostering diverse trajectory generation and avoiding the behavioral rigidity often imposed by human demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Horizon-Adaptive Policy Optimization. This mechanism explicitly accounts for varying horizon lengths during advantage estimation, facilitating accurate temporal credit assignment over extended sequences. Consequently, the agent develops diverse navigation behaviors and resists collapse during long-horizon tasks. Experiments on object navigation benchmarks validate the framework's efficacy: With 4,000 rollout trajectories, LongNav-R1 boosts the Qwen3-VL-2B success rate from 64.3% to 73.0%. These results demonstrate superior sample efficiency and significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. The model's generalizability and robustness are further validated by its zero-shot performance in long-horizon real-world navigation settings.

To establish a shared semantic latent space, the transmitters/receivers in TokenCom need to agree on an identical tokenizer model and codebook. To this end, an initial Tokenizer Agreement (TA) process is carried out in each communication episode, where the transmitter/receiver cooperate to choose from a set of pre-trained tokenizer models/ codebooks available to them both for efficient TokenCom. In this correspondence, we investigate TA in a multi-user downlink wireless TokenCom scenario, where the base station equipped with multiple antennas transmits video token streams to multiple users. We formulate the corresponding mixed-integer non-convex problem, and propose a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates a deep Q-network (DQN) for joint tokenizer agreement and sub-channel assignment, with a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) for beamforming.

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) preserves in situ gene expression, providing a spatial molecular context that complements morphology.

To this end, we introduce PathoSpatial, an interpretable end-to-end framework integrating co-registered WSIs and ST to learn spatially informed prognostic representations. PathoSpatial uses task-guided prototype learning within a multi-level experts architecture, adaptively orchestrating unsupervised within-modality discovery with supervised cross-modal aggregation. By design, PathoSpatial substantially strengthens interpretability while maintaining discriminative ability. We evaluate PathoSpatial on a triple-negative breast cancer cohort with paired ST and WSIs. PathoSpatial delivers strong and consistent performance across five survival endpoints, achieving superior or comparable performance to leading unimodal and multimodal methods.

However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets.

Our mesh-free physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach directly parametrises the conformal factor globally and is trained with a geometry-aware loss enforcing the curvature equation. Additional consistency checks were performed via the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and spherical-harmonic expansions were fit to the learnt models to provide interpretability.\n  For prescribed curvatures with known realisability, the neural network achieves very low losses ($10^{-7} - 10^{-10}$), while unrealisable curvatures yield significantly higher losses. This distinction enables the assessment of unknown cases, separating likely realisable functions from non-realisable ones.

The production and quality of grapes are significantly impacted by grape diseases such as Bacterial Rot, Downy Mildew, and Powdery Mildew. Consequently, the sustainable management of a vineyard necessitates the early and precise identification of these diseases. Current automated methods, particularly those that are based on the YOLO framework, are often computationally costly and lack interpretability that makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios. This study proposes grape leaf disease classification using Optimized DenseNet 121. Domain-specific preprocessing and extensive connectivity reveal disease-relevant characteristics, including veins, edges, and lesions. An extensive comparison with baseline CNN models, including ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet, demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits superior performance. It achieves an accuracy of 99.27%, an F1 score of 99.28%, a specificity of 99.71%, and a Kappa of 98.86%, with an inference time of 9 seconds. The cross-validation findings show a mean accuracy of 99.12%, indicating strength and generalizability across all classes. We also employ Grad-CAM to highlight disease-related regions to guarantee the model is highlighting physiologically relevant aspects and increase transparency and confidence. Model optimization reduces processing requirements for real-time deployment, while transfer learning ensures consistency on smaller and unbalanced samples. An effective architecture, domain-specific preprocessing, and interpretable outputs make the proposed framework scalable, precise, and computationally inexpensive for detecting grape leaf diseases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f18\u5316\u7684DenseNet121\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u8461\u8404\u53f6\u75c5\u5bb3\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfYOLO\u7b49\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u8461\u8404\u56ed\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u75c5\u5bb3\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u7684DenseNet121\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0eGrad-CAM\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4ResNet18\u3001VGG16\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u51c6\u786e\u738799.27%\uff0cF1\u5206\u657099.28%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u602799.71%\uff0cKappa\u503c98.86%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f49\u79d2\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u738799.12%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u4e3a\u8461\u8404\u75c5\u5bb3\u667a\u80fd\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prior approaches either treat failure reasoning as a closed-set classification problem or assume access to ample human annotations. Failures in the real world are typically subtle, combinatorial, and difficult to enumerate, whereas rich reasoning labels are expensive to acquire. We address this problem by introducing ARMOR: Adaptive Round-based Multi-task mOdel for Robotic failure detection and reasoning. We formulate detection and reasoning as a multi-task self-refinement process, where the model iteratively predicts detection outcomes and natural language reasoning conditioned on past outputs. During training, ARMOR learns from heterogeneous supervision - large-scale sparse binary labels and small-scale rich reasoning annotations - optimized via a combination of offline and online imitation learning. At inference time, ARMOR generates multiple refinement trajectories and selects the most confident prediction via a self-certainty metric. Experiments across diverse environments show that ARMOR achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving over the previous approaches by up to 30% on failure detection rate and up to 100% in reasoning measured through LLM fuzzy match score, demonstrating robustness to heterogeneous supervision and open-ended reasoning beyond predefined failure modes.

We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings.

Segmentation models, in contrast, optimize pixel-accurate masks that may misalign with such bodies. We ask whether and when these models nonetheless acquire human-like bodies. Using a time-to-collision (TTC) behavioral paradigm, we introduce a comparison pipeline and alignment metric, then vary model training time, size, and effective capacity via pruning. Across all manipulations, alignment with human behavior follows an inverse U-shaped curve: small/briefly trained/pruned models under-segment into blobs; large/fully trained models over-segment with boundary wiggles; and an intermediate ideal body granularity'' best matches humans. This suggests human-like coarse bodies emerge from resource constraints rather than bespoke biases, and points to simple knobs - early checkpoints, modest architectures, light pruning - for eliciting physics-efficient representations.

The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVBE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5b9e\u73b0\u9996\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e50\u89c2\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1bonus\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u540e\u624d\u589e\u52a0\u4ef7\u503cbonus\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9f13\u52b1\u9996\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u65b0\u72b6\u6001", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4ef7\u503cbonus\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u8bef\u5dee\uff08VBE\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e00\u7ec4\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\uff08RQFs\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u4ef7\u503cbonus", "result": "VBE\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u63a2\u7d22\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eBootstrap DQN\u3001RND\u548cACB\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8f7b\u677e\u6269\u5c55\u81f3Atari\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883", "conclusion": "VBE\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5f52\u96f6\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9996\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e50\u89c2\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387"}}

One particular application of this technique is slice-level content navigation, where the goal is to localize specific 2D slices within a 3D volume or determine the anatomical coverage of a 3D scan based on its 2D slices. This serves as an important preprocessing step for various diagnostic tasks, as well as for automatic registration and segmentation pipelines. Our approach builds sequence correspondence by training a network to learn how to insert a slice from one sequence into the appropriate position in another. This is achieved by encoding contextual representations of each slice and modeling the insertion process using a slice-to-slice attention mechanism. We apply this method to localize manually labeled key slices in body CT scans and compare its performance to the current state-of-the-art alternative known as body part regression, which predicts anatomical position scores for individual slices. Unlike body part regression, which treats each slice independently, our method leverages contextual information from the entire sequence.

These environments are dynamic and often visually occluded, which complicates perception and navigation. In this context, valuable information from audio sources remains underutilized in most autonomy stacks. This work presents a control barrier function (CBF)-based safety filter that provides safety guarantees for obstacle avoidance while adapting safety margins during navigation using an audio-derived risk cue. The proposed framework augments the CBF with a lightweight, real-time jackhammer detector based on signal envelope and periodicity. Its output serves as an exogenous risk that is directly enforced in the controller by modulating the barrier function. The approach is evaluated in simulation with two CBF formulations (circular and goal-aligned elliptical) with a unicycle robot navigating a cluttered construction environment. Results show that the CBF safety filter eliminates safety violations across all trials while reaching the target in 40.2% (circular) vs. 76.5% (elliptical), as the elliptical formulation better avoids deadlock. This integration of audio perception into a CBF-based controller demonstrates a pathway toward richer multimodal safety reasoning in autonomous robots for safety-critical and dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u589e\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u907f\u969c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u5de5\u5730\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u906e\u6321\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ffd\u89c6\u97f3\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u98ce\u9669\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08\u51ff\u5ca9\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBF\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u53f7\u5305\u7edc\u4e0e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5e76\u8c03\u5236CBF\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u4e24\u79cdCBF\u5f62\u5f0f\u5747\u65e0\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff1b\u692d\u5706\u5f62CBF\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u6210\u738776.5%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5706\u5f62CBF\u768440.2%\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u6b7b\u9501\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u97f3\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5165CBF\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

First, to interrupt error propagation during learning, we train the ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust (SDR) pseudo-outcomes, which provide bias-corrected targets for each regression. Second, we employ a multi-task Transformer with a covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision, regularizing representations against corruption by noisy pseudo-outcomes, and a target network to stabilize training dynamics. For the final estimate, we discard the SDR correction and instead use the uncorrected nuisance models to perform Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (LTMLE) on the original outcomes. This second-stage, targeted debiasing ensures robustness and optimal finite-sample properties. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model, D3-Net, robustly reduces bias and variance across different horizons, counterfactuals, and time-varying confoundings, compared to existing state-of-the-art ICE-based estimators.", "AI": {"tldr": "D3-Net\u901a\u8fc7SDR\u4f2a\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1Transformer\u7f13\u89e3ICE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u7528LTMLE\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u7ec8\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfICE G-computation\u56e0\u9012\u5f52\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7eb5\u5411\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528SDR\u4f2a\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u65ad\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u4efb\u52a1Transformer\uff08\u542b\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u6a21\u62df\u5934\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f7f\u7528LTMLE\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "result": "D3-Net\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709ICE\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "D3-Net\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

To systematically characterize this limitation, we introduce a radiology-specific diagnostic benchmark that evaluates polarity sensitivity under controlled clinical conditions, revealing that common medical VLMs consistently confuse negated and non-negated findings. To enable learning beyond simple condition absence, we further construct a contextual clinical negation dataset that encodes structured claims and supports attribute-level negations involving location and severity. Building on these resources, we propose Negation-Aware Selective Training (NAST), an interpretability-guided adaptation method that uses causal tracing effects (CTEs) to modulate layer-wise gradient updates during fine-tuning. Rather than applying uniform learning rates, NAST scales each layer's update according to its causal contribution to negation processing, transforming mechanistic interpretability signals into a principled optimization rule. Experiments demonstrate improved discrimination of affirmative and negated clinical statements without degrading general vision-language alignment, highlighting the value of causal interpretability for targeted model adaptation in safety-critical medical settings.

Existing deep learning models often struggle with interpretability and generalization across diverse market conditions. This research presents a hybrid stacked-generalization framework, TFT-ACB-XML, for BTC closing price prediction. The framework integrates two parallel base learners: a customized Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and an Attention-Customized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (ACB), followed by an XGBoost regressor as the meta-learner. The customized TFT model handles long-range dependencies and global temporal dynamics via variable selection networks and interpretable single-head attention. The ACB module uses a new attention mechanism alongside the customized BiLSTM to capture short-term sequential dependencies. Predictions from both customized TFT and ACB are weighted through an error-reciprocal weighting strategy. These weights are derived from validation performance, where a model showing lower prediction error receives a higher weight. Finally, the framework concatenates these weighted outputs into a feature vector and feeds the vector to an XGBoost regressor, which captures non-linear residuals and produces the final BTC closing price prediction. Empirical validation using BTC data from October 1, 2014, to January 5, 2026, shows improved performance of the proposed framework compared to recent Deep Learning and Transformer baseline models. The results show a MAPE of 0.65%, an MAE of 198.15, and an RMSE of 258.30 for one-step-ahead out-of-sample under a walk-forward evaluation on the test block.

These differences make precise image matching (co-registration) of these two types of images difficult. In this paper, we propose a new approach to image matching of optical and SAR images, which is based on transforming the images to a new modality. The new image modality is common to both optical and SAR images and satisfies the following conditions. First, the transformed images must have an equal pre-defined number of channels. Second, the transformed and co-registered images must be as similar as possible. Third, the transformed images must be non-degenerate, meaning they must preserve the significant features of the original images. To further match images transformed to this shared modality, we train the RoMa image matching model, which is one of the leading solutions for matching of regular digital photographs. We evaluated the proposed approach on the publicly available MultiSenGE dataset containing both optical and SAR images.

Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (under review)", "summary": "We present a quadrotor dynamics Gaussian Process (GP) with gradient information that achieves real-time inference via state-space partitioning and approximation, and that includes aerodynamic effects using data from mid-fidelity potential flow simulations. While traditional GP-based approaches provide reliable Bayesian predictions with uncertainty quantification, they are computationally expensive and thus unsuitable for real-time simulations. To address this challenge, we integrate gradient information to improve accuracy and introduce a novel partitioning and approximation strategy to reduce online computational cost. In particular, for the latter, we associate a local GP with each non-overlapping region; by splitting the training data into local near and far subsets, and by using Schur complements, we show that a large part of the matrix inversions required for inference can be performed offline, enabling real-time inference at frequencies above 30 Hz on standard desktop hardware. To generate a training dataset that captures aerodynamic effects, such as rotor-rotor interactions and apparent wind direction, we use the CHARM code, which is a mid-fidelity aerodynamic solver. It is applied to the SUI Endurance quadrotor to predict force and torque, along with noise at three specified locations. The derivative information is obtained via finite differences. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed partitioned GP with gradient conditioning achieves higher accuracy than standard partitioned GPs without gradient information, while greatly reducing computational time.

We propose an alternative route based on two theoretically grounded and empirically testable signatures of deep Jacobians: depth-induced exponential scaling of ordered singular values and strong spectral separation. Adopting a fixed-gates view of piecewise-linear networks, where Jacobians reduce to products of masked linear maps within a single activation region, we prove the existence of Lyapunov exponents governing the top singular values at initialization, give closed-form expressions in a tractable masked model, and quantify finite-depth corrections. We further show that sufficiently strong separation forces singular-vector alignment in matrix products, yielding an approximately shared singular basis for intermediate Jacobians. Together, these results motivate an approximation regime in which singular-value dynamics become effectively decoupled, mirroring classical balanced deep-linear analyses without requiring balancing. Experiments in fixed-gates settings validate the predicted scaling, alignment, and resulting dynamics, supporting a mechanistic account of emergent low-rank Jacobian structure as a driver of implicit bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edcJacobian\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u6307\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u4e0e\u8c31\u5206\u79bb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e73\u8861\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u68af\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u95e8\u63a7\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u6bb5\u7ebf\u6027\u7f51\u7edc\u7684Jacobian\u89c6\u4e3a\u63a9\u7801\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u4e58\u79ef\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u7684Lyapunov\u6307\u6570\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0e\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u6307\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u4e0e\u5f3a\u8c31\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e2d\u95f4Jacobian\u5171\u4eab\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5947\u5f02\u57fa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u91cd\u73b0\u5e73\u8861\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5e73\u8861\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002"}}

We propose a composable, model-free reinforcement learning method that learns a value function and an optimal policy for each individual environment element (e.g., goal or obstacle) and composes them online to achieve goal reaching and collision avoidance. Assuming unknown nonlinear dynamics that evolve in continuous time and are input-affine, we derive a continuous-time Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the value function and show that the corresponding advantage function is quadratic in the action and optimal policy. Based on this structure, we introduce a model-free actor-critic algorithm that learns policies and value functions for static or moving obstacles using gradient descent. We then compose multiple reach/avoid models via a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), yielding formal obstacle-avoidance guarantees in terms of value-function level sets, providing a model-free alternative to CLF/CBF-based controllers.

A fundamental challenge arises from the imbalance between high-entropy vision and language inputs and low-entropy but critical force signals, which often leads to over-reliance on perception and unstable control. To address this, we introduce CRAFT, a force-aware curriculum fine-tuning framework that integrates a variational information bottleneck module to regulate vision and language embeddings during early training. This curriculum strategy encourages the model to prioritize force signals initially, before progressively restoring access to the full multimodal information. To enable force-aware learning, we further design a homologous leader-follower teleoperation system that collects synchronized vision, language, and force data across diverse contact-rich tasks.

This gap is primarily due to (i) the absence of high-quality, privacy-sensitive data that capture personalized user-LLM interactions at scale, and (ii) the lack of robust reward signals for individual preferences. To overcome existing data limitations, we introduce a high-fidelity synthetic data generation framework called PersonaGym. Unlike prior work that treats personalization as static persona-preference pairs, PersonaGym models a dynamic preference process via an agentic LLM system to simulate realistic preference behaviors and semantic-aware noise in order to generate personalized multi-turn interaction trajectories. Using PersonaGym, we release PersonaAtlas, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse synthetic dataset of high-fidelity multi-turn personalized interaction trajectories that closely mirror real-world preference expression and noise patterns. We further propose Personalized Prompt Optimization (PPOpt), a scalable and model-agnostic framework that optimizes user prompts based on interaction histories without modifying the deployed LLM. PPOpt adopts a reason-then-optimize paradigm that infers an explicit user profile and conditions prompt rewriting on the user profile to avoid reward hacking. Our training procedure for PPOpt integrates a cold-start supervised prior with outcome-driven multi-objective reinforcement learning.

First, we design a target trajectory prediction method and a visibility-aware initial path generation algorithm that maintain an appropriate observation distance, avoid occlusions, and enable rapid replanning to reacquire the target when it is lost. Then, we propose the Field of View ESDF (FoV-ESDF), a precomputed ESDF tailored to the tracker's field of view, enabling rapid visibility evaluation without requiring updates. Finally, we optimize the trajectory using differentiable FoV-ESDF-based objectives to ensure continuous visibility throughout the tracking process.

However, despite the continued rise in design complexity, advances in AMS automation remain limited. This reflects the central challenge in developing a generalized optimization method applicable across diverse circuit design spaces, many of which are distinct, constrained, and non-differentiable. To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation. Importantly, the proposed approach operates at the level of individual transistors, enabling highly expressive, fine-grained topology generation. Strong inductive biases encoded in the action space and environment further drive structurally consistent and valid generation.

We identify a critical decoupling failure in current research: the lack of distinction between appearance-based shifts, such as weather and lighting, and structural scene changes. This leaves a fundamental question unanswered: Is the planner failing because of complex road geometry, or simply because it is raining? To resolve this, we establish navdream, a high-fidelity robustness benchmark leveraging generative pixel-aligned style transfer. By creating a visual stress test with negligible geometric deviation, we isolate the impact of appearance on driving performance. Our evaluation reveals that existing planning algorithms often show significant degradation under OOD appearance conditions, even when the underlying scene structure remains consistent. To bridge this gap, we propose a universal perception interface leveraging a frozen visual foundation model (DINOv3). By extracting appearance-invariant features as a stable interface for the planner, we achieve exceptional zero-shot generalization across diverse planning paradigms, including regression-based, diffusion-based, and scoring-based models.

However, once a device is embedded in its host environment, conventional chamber- and turntable-based antenna measurements are often impractical. This paper presents a hemispherical angular received-power mapping methodology for in-situ EM validation of installed mmWave modules under realistic deployment constraints. The approach samples the accessible half-space around a stationary device-under-test by placing a calibrated receiving probe at prescribed (phi, theta, r) locations using geometry-consistent positioning and quasi-static acquisition. Amplitude-only received-power is recorded using standard RF instrumentation to generate hemispherical angular power maps that capture installation-dependent radiation characteristics.

To leverage conventional image processing pipelines, events are typically binned into frames. However, binning functions are discontinuous, which truncates gradients at the frame level and forces most event-based algorithms to rely solely on frame-based features. Attempts to directly learn from raw events avoid this restriction but instead suffer from biased gradient estimation due to the discontinuities of the binning operation, ultimately limiting their learning efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for unbiased gradient estimation of arbitrary binning functions by synthesizing weak derivatives during backpropagation while keeping the forward output unchanged. The key idea is to exploit integration by parts: lifting the target functions to functionals yields an integral form of the derivative of the binning function during backpropagation, where the cotangent function naturally arises. By reconstructing this cotangent function from the sampled cotangent vector, we compute weak derivatives that provably match long-range finite differences of both smooth and non-smooth targets.

The system consists of two components: (1) a social navigation framework implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 that integrates real-time RGB-D perception using an OAK-D Lite camera, YOLOv8-based object detection, COMPOSER-based collective activity recognition, D* Lite dynamic path planning, and haptic feedback via vibration motors for tasks such as locating a vacant seat; and (2) an agentic multimodal LLM-VLM interaction framework that integrates speech recognition, vision language models, large language models, and text-to-speech, with dynamic routing between voice-only and vision-only modes to enable natural voice-based communication, scene description, and object localization from visual input. The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions. Group activity recognition further shows robust performance across diverse crowd scenarios. In addition, a preliminary exploratory user study with eight visually impaired and low-vision participants evaluates the agentic interaction framework through structured tasks and a UTAUT-based questionnaire reveals high acceptance and positive perceptions of usability, trust, and perceived sociability during our experiments. The results highlight the potential of PISHYAR as a multimodal assistive mobility aid that extends beyond navigation to provide socially interactive support for such users.", "AI": {"tldr": "PISHYAR\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u7ed3\u5408\u793e\u4ea4\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u62d0\u6756\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u4e0e\u793e\u4ea4\u652f\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u52a9\u884c\u8bbe\u5907\u7f3a\u4e4f\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u89c6\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u5728\u590d\u6742\u793e\u4f1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Raspberry Pi 5\u96c6\u6210RGB-D\u611f\u77e5\u3001YOLOv8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001COMPOSER\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u3001D* Lite\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u632f\u52a8\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM-VLM\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u97f3-\u89c6\u89c9\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea680%\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u7fa4\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u63a5\u53d7\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u4fe1\u4efb\u611f\u4e0e\u793e\u4ea4\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PISHYAR\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5bfc\u822a\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary \"full-rank\" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors. Our method enables stable, end-to-end factorized training with negligible overhead. Finally, we establish compute-optimal scaling laws for natively low-rank transformers, demonstrating predictable power-law behavior and improved inference efficiency relative to dense models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSpectron\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ec5\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u6743\u91cd\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f85\u52a9\u5168\u79e9\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f4e\u79e9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Spectron\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4e0e\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u4f4e\u79e9\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u5931\u63a7\u589e\u957f\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f4e\u79e9LLM\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7a20\u5bc6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7f29\u653e\u5f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "Spectron\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f4e\u79e9\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

It can dynamically adapt to various predefined bit-widths by cascading different low-rank adapters, and supports real-time switching between uniform quantization and mixed precision quantization without repeated optimization. To enhance accuracy and robustness, we introduce Multi-Bit Token Merging (MB-ToMe) to dynamically fuse token features across different bit-widths, improving robustness during bit-width switching. Additionally, we propose Multi-Bit Cascaded Low-Rank adapters (MB-CLoRA) to strengthen correlations between bit-width groups, further improve the overall performance of QuEPT.

The proposed approach integrates a backup policy (shield) with the RL agent, leveraging Gaussian process (GP) based uncertainty quantification to predict potential violations of safety constraints, dynamically recovering to safe trajectories only when necessary.

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel physics-constrained Real-to-Sim pipeline that reconstructs physically consistent 3D scenes from single-view RGB-D data.

Lokhov", "Sidhant Misra"], "title": "Computationally sufficient statistics for Ising models", "comment": null, "summary": "Learning Gibbs distributions using only sufficient statistics has long been recognized as a computationally hard problem. On the other hand, computationally efficient algorithms for learning Gibbs distributions rely on access to full sample configurations generated from the model. For many systems of interest that arise in physical contexts, expecting a full sample to be observed is not practical, and hence it is important to look for computationally efficient methods that solve the learning problem with access to only a limited set of statistics. We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\\ell_1$ width $\u03b3$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(\u03b3)$. This approach allows us to infer the model's structure and also learn its couplings and magnetic fields.

However, their iterative sampling process, which gradually morphs random noise into coherent images, introduces significant latency that limits their applicability. While recent few-step diffusion models reduce the number of sampling steps to as few as one to four steps, they often compromise image quality and prompt alignment, especially in one-step generation. Additionally, these models require computationally expensive training procedures. To address these limitations, we propose ImageRAGTurbo, a novel approach to efficiently finetune few-step diffusion models via retrieval augmentation. Given a text prompt, we retrieve relevant text-image pairs from a database and use them to condition the generation process. We argue that such retrieved examples provide rich contextual information to the UNet denoiser that helps reduce the number of denoising steps without compromising image quality. Indeed, our initial investigations show that using the retrieved content to edit the denoiser's latent space ($\\mathcal{H}$-space) without additional finetuning already improves prompt fidelity. To further improve the quality of the generated images, we augment the UNet denoiser with a trainable adapter in the $\\mathcal{H}$-space, which efficiently blends the retrieved content with the target prompt using a cross-attention mechanism. Experimental results on fast text-to-image generation demonstrate that our approach produces high-fidelity images without compromising latency compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faImageRAGTurbo\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u5fae\u8c03\u5c11\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c11\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u6570\u65f6\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u5316UNet\u53bb\u566a\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7H\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u914d\u5668\u878d\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

In particular, while low-level motion tracking and trajectory-following controllers are mature, whole-body reference-guided methods are difficult to adapt to higher-level command interfaces and diverse task contexts: they require large, high-quality datasets, are brittle across speed and pose regimes, and are sensitive to robot-specific calibration. To address these limitations, we propose the Parameterized Motion Generator (PMG), a real-time motion generator grounded in an analysis of human motion structure that synthesizes reference trajectories using only a compact set of parameterized motion data together with High-dimensional control commands. Combined with an imitation-learning pipeline and an optimization-based sim-to-real motor parameter identification module, we validate the complete approach on our humanoid prototype ZERITH Z1 and show that, within a single integrated system, PMG produces natural, human-like locomotion, responds precisely to high-dimensional control inputs-including VR-based teleoperation-and enables efficient, verifiable sim-to-real transfer.

During post-training, we propose several techniques for training the VLA model for asynchronous execution to address the inference latency during real-robot rollouts. During deployment, we carefully align the timesteps of consecutive predicted action chunks to ensure continuous and seamless real-time rollouts. We evaluate Xiaomi-Robotics-0 extensively in simulation benchmarks and on two challenging real-robot tasks that require precise and dexterous bimanual manipulation. Results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all simulation benchmarks.

We propose a regularized meta-learning framework that addresses these challenges through a four-stage pipeline combining redundancy-aware projection, statistical meta-feature augmentation, and cross-validated regularized meta-models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet). Our multi-metric de-duplication strategy removes near-collinear predictors using correlation and MSE thresholds ($\u03c4_{\\text{corr}}=0.95$), reducing the effective condition number of the meta-design matrix while preserving predictive diversity. Engineered ensemble statistics and interaction terms recover higher-order structure unavailable to raw prediction columns. A final inverse-RMSE blending stage mitigates regularizer-selection variance. On the Playground Series S6E1 benchmark (100K samples, 72 base models), the proposed framework achieves an out-of-fold RMSE of 8.582, improving over simple averaging (8.894) and conventional Ridge stacking (8.627), while matching greedy hill climbing (8.603) with substantially lower runtime (4 times faster). Conditioning analysis shows a 53.7\\% reduction in effective matrix condition number after redundancy projection.

However, in the literature cloudless analysis is often performed where cloudy images are excluded from machine learning datasets and methods. Such an approach cannot be applied to time sensitive applications, e.g., during natural disasters. A possible solution is to apply cloud removal as a preprocessing step to ensure that cloudfree solutions are not failing under such conditions. But cloud removal methods are still actively researched and suffer from drawbacks, such as generated visual artifacts. Therefore, it is desirable to develop cloud robust methods that are less affected by cloudy weather. Cloud robust methods can be achieved by combining optical data with radar, a modality unaffected by clouds. While many datasets for machine learning combine optical and radar data, most researchers exclude cloudy images. We identify this exclusion from machine learning training and evaluation as a limitation that reduces applicability to cloudy scenarios. To investigate this, we assembled a dataset, named CloudyBigEarthNet (CBEN), of paired optical and radar images with cloud occlusion for training and evaluation. Using average precision (AP) as the evaluation metric, we show that state-of-the-art methods trained on combined clear-sky optical and radar imagery suffer performance drops of 23-33 percentage points when evaluated on cloudy images. We then adapt these methods to cloudy optical data during training, achieving relative improvement of 17.2-28.7 percentage points on cloudy test cases compared with the original approaches.

This work studies how robots can similarly exploit signs for mapless navigation in the open world. A central challenge lies in interpreting signs: real-world signs are diverse and complex, and their abstract semantic contents need to be grounded in the local 3D scene. We formalize this as sign grounding, the problem of mapping semantic instructions on signs to corresponding scene elements and navigational actions. Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the semantic common-sense and reasoning capabilities required for this task, but are sensitive to how spatial information is represented. We propose SignScene, a sign-centric spatial-semantic representation that captures navigation-relevant scene elements and sign information, and presents them to VLMs in a form conducive to effective reasoning. We evaluate our grounding approach on a dataset of 114 queries collected across nine diverse environment types, achieving 88% grounding accuracy and significantly outperforming baselines.

Traditional approaches treat it as an optimization problem, relying on per-instance heuristics or constraint-based search. We instead reframe RNA design as conditional sequence generation and introduce a reusable neural approximator, instantiated as an autoregressive language model (LM), that maps target structures directly to sequences. We first train our model in a supervised setting on random-induced structure-sequence pairs, and then use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize end-to-end metrics. We also propose methods to select a small subset for RL that greatly improves RL efficiency and quality. Across four datasets, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art systems on key metrics such as Boltzmann probability while being 1.7x faster, establishing conditional LM generation as a scalable, task-agnostic alternative to per-instance optimization for RNA design.

Existing fairness-aware datasets have significantly improved demographic balance across global race and gender groups, yet they continue to treat Indian as a single monolithic category. The oversimplification ignores the vast intra-national diversity across 28 states and 8 Union Territories of India and leads to representational and geographical bias. To address the limitation, we present IndicFairFace, a novel and balanced face dataset comprising 14,400 images representing geographical diversity of India. Images were sourced ethically from Wikimedia Commons and open-license web repositories and uniformly balanced across states and gender. Using IndicFairFace, we quantify intra-national geographical bias in prominent CLIP-based VLMs and reduce it using post-hoc Iterative Nullspace Projection debiasing approach. We also show that the adopted debiasing approach does not adversely impact the existing embedding space as the average drop in retrieval accuracy on benchmark datasets is less than 1.5 percent.

Central to this process is the value function, which provides learning signals to guide VLA learning from experience. In practice, the value function is estimated from trajectory fragments collected from different data sources, including historical policies and intermittent human interventions. Estimating the value function of current behavior quality from the mixture data is inherently an off-policy evaluation problem. However, prior work often adopts conservative on-policy estimation for stability, which avoids direct evaluation of the current high-capacity policy and limits learning effectiveness. In this paper, we propose ALOE, an action-level off-policy evaluation framework for VLA post-training. ALOE applies chunking-based temporal-difference bootstrapping to evaluate individual action sequences instead of predicting final task outcomes. This design improves effective credit assignment to critical action chunks under sparse rewards and supports stable policy improvement. We evaluate our method on three real-world manipulation tasks, including smartphone packing as a high-precision task, laundry folding as a long-horizon deformable-object task, and bimanual pick-and-place involving multi-object perception. Across all tasks, ALOE improves learning efficiency without compromising execution speed, showing that off-policy RL can be reintroduced in a reliable manner for real-world VLA post-training.

In this paper, we provide a tighter analysis of gradient descent for this problem when the data is two-dimensional: we show that GD with a sufficiently large learning rate $\u03b7$ finds a point with loss smaller than $\\mathcal{O}(1/(\u03b7T))$, as long as $T \\geq \u03a9(n/\u03b3+ 1/\u03b3^2)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Our improved rate comes from a tighter bound on the time $\u03c4$ that it takes for GD to transition from unstable (non-monotonic loss) to stable (monotonic loss), via a fine-grained analysis of the oscillatory dynamics of GD in the subspace orthogonal to the max-margin classifier.

Project page: https://vvsjeon.github.io/MPD/", "summary": "Recent progress in image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of generative inbetweening, which aims to generate semantically plausible frames between two keyframes. In particular, inference-time sampling strategies, which leverage the generative priors of large-scale pre-trained I2V models without additional training, have become increasingly popular. However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths. This is because each path follows the motion prior induced by its own conditioning frame. In this work, we propose Motion Prior Distillation (MPD), a simple yet effective inference-time distillation technique that suppresses bidirectional mismatch by distilling the motion residual of the forward path into the backward path. Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior. We not only perform quantitative evaluations on standard benchmarks, but also conduct extensive user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMotion Prior Distillation\uff08MPD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u524d\u5411\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6b8b\u5dee\u6765\u6539\u5584\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u53cc\u5411\u8def\u5f84\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cc\u5411\u8def\u5f84\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u56e0\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "method": "Motion Prior Distillation (MPD)\uff1a\u5c06\u524d\u5411\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6b8b\u5dee\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u540e\u5411\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u7ec8\u70b9\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u5f84\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u524d\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "MPD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347I2V\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional fuzzy PID tuning often relies on empirical methods, making it difficult to achieve a stable and reproducible equilibrium solution between performance enhancement and control cost. This paper proposes a constrained particle swarm optimization (PSO) method for tuning six-parameter fuzzy PID controllers. By adjusting the benchmark PID parameters alongside the fuzzy controller's input quantization factor and output proportional gain, it achieves synergistic optimization of the overall tuning strength and dynamic response characteristics of the fuzzy PID system. To ensure engineering feasibility of the optimization results, a time-weighted absolute error integral, adjustment time, relative overshoot control energy, and saturation occupancy rate are introduced. Control energy constraints are applied to construct a constraint-driven comprehensive evaluation system, suppressing pseudo-improvements achieved solely by increasing control inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that, while maintaining consistent control energy and saturation levels, the proposed method significantly enhances deep tracking performance: the time-weighted absolute error integral decreases from 0.2631 to 0.1473, the settling time shortens from 2.301 s to 1.613 s, and the relative overshoot reduces from 0.1494 to 0.01839. Control energy varied from 7980 to 7935, satisfying the energy constraint, while saturation occupancy decreased from 0.004 to 0.003. These results validate the effectiveness and engineering significance of the proposed constrained six-parameter joint tuning strategy for depth control in underwater vehicle navigation scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8c03\u4f18\u516d\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u7ccaPID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6c34\u4e0b\u6f5c\u5668\u6df1\u5ea6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u80fd\u8017\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u5668\u9971\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u7ccaPID\u8c03\u53c2\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u4ee3\u4ef7\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u7c92\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f18\u5316\uff08CPSO\uff09\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u51c6PID\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u8f93\u5165\u91cf\u5316\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u79ef\u5206\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u8c03\u8282\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u8d85\u8c03\u91cf\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u9971\u548c\u5360\u6709\u7387\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u91cf\u57fa\u672c\u4e0d\u53d8\uff087980\u21927935\uff09\u548c\u9971\u548c\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\uff080.004\u21920.003\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u79ef\u5206\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e44%\uff080.2631\u21920.1473\uff09\uff0c\u8c03\u8282\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed30%\uff082.301\u21921.613s\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u8c03\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u8fd190%\uff080.1494\u21920.01839\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u7ea6\u675f\u8054\u5408\u8c03\u53c2\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6c34\u4e0b\u6f5c\u5668\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4ec5\u9760\u589e\u52a0\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f2a\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Prior work trains MCI encoders but typically evaluates them via full fine-tuning, leaving probing with frozen pre-trained encoders comparatively underexplored. Existing studies that perform probing largely focus on improving representations, rather than how to best leverage fixed representations for downstream tasks. Although the latter problem has been studied in other domains, directly transferring those strategies to MCI yields weak results, even worse than training from scratch. We therefore propose Channel-Aware Probing (CAP), which exploits the intrinsic inter-channel diversity in MCI datasets by controlling feature flow at both the encoder and probe levels. CAP uses Independent Feature Encoding (IFE) to encode each channel separately, and Decoupled Pooling (DCP) to pool within channels before aggregating across channels. Across three MCI benchmarks, CAP consistently improves probing performance over the default probing protocol, matches fine-tuning from scratch, and largely reduces the gap to full fine-tuning from the same MCI pre-trained checkpoints.

In addition, most existing approaches assume static environments, limiting their use in human-populated settings.

Our study adopts a structured data model with tokens that include both class-relevant and class-irrelevant patterns under token-level noise and examines two canonical regimes: majority-voting and locality-structured data sequences. We prove that the model achieves guaranteed generalization by establishing non-asymptotic sample complexity and convergence rate bounds, which improve as the effective signal increases and the noise decreases. Furthermore, we show that the gating vector aligns with class-relevant features while ignoring irrelevant ones, thereby formalizing a feature-selection role similar to attention but realized through selective recurrence. Numerical experiments on synthetic data justify our theoretical results. Overall, our results provide principled insight into when and why Mamba-style selective SSMs learn efficiently, offering a theoretical counterpoint to Transformer-centric explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9Mamba\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1Mamba\u7b49\u9009\u62e9\u6027SSM\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u5355\u5934\u9009\u62e9\u6027SSM\uff08\u542b\u8f93\u5165\u4f9d\u8d56\u95e8\u63a7\u548c\u53cc\u5c42MLP\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u4e24\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u7387\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u4fe1\u53f7\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u964d\u4f4e\u800c\u6539\u5584\uff1b\u95e8\u63a7\u5411\u91cf\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u7c7b\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aMamba\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u8d8aTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Real2Gen to train a manipulation policy from a single human demonstration. Real2Gen extracts required information from the demonstration and transfers it to a simulation environment, where a programmable expert agent can demonstrate the task arbitrarily many times, generating an unlimited amount of data to train a flow matching policy. We evaluate Real2Gen on human demonstrations from three different real-world tasks and compare it to a recent baseline. Real2Gen shows an average increase in the success rate of 26.6% and better generalization of the trained policy due to the abundance and diversity of training data.

While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive.

Traditional Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) methods rely on linear interaction histories, which struggle to handle long-context tasks, especially those involving information-sparse yet token-heavy visual data in iterative reasoning scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce VimRAG, a framework tailored for multimodal Retrieval-augmented Reasoning across text, images, and videos. Inspired by our systematic study, we model the reasoning process as a dynamic directed acyclic graph that structures the agent states and retrieved multimodal evidence. Building upon this structured memory, we introduce a Graph-Modulated Visual Memory Encoding mechanism, with which the significance of memory nodes is evaluated via their topological position, allowing the model to dynamically allocate high-resolution tokens to pivotal evidence while compressing or discarding trivial clues. To implement this paradigm, we propose a Graph-Guided Policy Optimization strategy.

Compared to classical industrial applications, more flexibility is needed in combination with real-time reactivity. Learning-based methods can train powerful policies based on demonstrated trajectories, such that the robot generalizes a task to similar situations. However, these black-box models lack interpretability and rigorous safety guarantees. Optimization-based methods provide these guarantees but lack the required flexibility and generalization capabilities. This work proposes SafeFlowMPC, a combination of flow matching and online optimization to combine the strengths of learning and optimization. This method guarantees safety at all times and is designed to meet the demands of real-time execution by using a suboptimal model-predictive control formulation.

To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite for MFGs (Bench-MFG), focusing on the discrete-time, discrete-space, stationary setting for the sake of clarity. We introduce a taxonomy of problem classes, ranging from no-interaction and monotone games to potential and dynamics-coupled games, and provide prototypical environments for each. Furthermore, we propose MF-Garnets, a method for generating random MFG instances to facilitate rigorous statistical testing. We benchmark a variety of learning algorithms across these environments, including a novel black-box approach (MF-PSO) for exploitability minimization.

To address this challenge, we present a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imaginative roll-outs. We design a world model trained with variational auto-encoders and augment the model using the state-action learned embedding (SALE). SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions.

When exploring such fabrics, fingertip skin senses both spatio-temporal force patterns and texture-induced vibrations that are integrated to form a haptic representation of the explored material. It is challenging to reproduce this rich, dynamic perceptual capability in robots because tactile sensors typically cannot achieve both high spatial resolution and high temporal sampling rate. In this work, we present a system that can sense both types of haptic information, and we investigate how each type influences robotic tactile perception of fabrics. Our robotic hand's middle finger and thumb each feature a soft tactile sensor: one is the open-source Minsight sensor that uses an internal camera to measure fingertip deformation and force at 50 Hz, and the other is our new sensor Minsound that captures vibrations through an internal MEMS microphone with a bandwidth from 50 Hz to 15 kHz. Inspired by the movements humans make to evaluate fabrics, our robot actively encloses and rubs folded fabric samples between its two sensitive fingers. Our results test the influence of each sensing modality on overall classification performance, showing high utility for the audio-based sensor. Our transformer-based method achieves a maximum fabric classification accuracy of 97 % on a dataset of 20 common fabrics. Incorporating an external microphone away from Minsound increases our method's robustness in loud ambient noise conditions.

While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric.

Yet most prior work targets whole brain age (WBA), a coarse paradigm that struggles to support tasks such as disease characterization and research on development and aging patterns, because relevant changes are typically region-selective rather than brain-wide. Therefore, robust regional brain age (ReBA) estimation is critical, yet a widely generalizable model has yet to be established. In this paper, we propose the Regional Brain Age Prediction Network (ReBA-Pred-Net), a Teacher-Student framework designed for fine-grained brain age estimation. The Teacher produces soft ReBA to guide the Student to yield reliable ReBA estimates with a clinical-prior consistency constraint (regions within the same function should change similarly). For rigorous evaluation, we introduce two indirect metrics: Healthy Control Similarity (HCS), which assesses statistical consistency by testing whether regional brain-age-gap (ReBA minus chronological age) distributions align between training and unseen HC; and Neuro Disease Correlation (NDC), which assesses factual consistency by checking whether clinically confirmed patients show elevated brain-age-gap in disease-associated regions.

However, existing approaches are fundamentally misaligned with the needs of embodied tasks. As they rely on either offline batch processing or implicit feature embeddings, the maps can hardly support interpretable human-intent reasoning in complex environments. To address these limitations, we present INHerit-SG. We redefine the map as a structured, RAG-ready knowledge base where natural-language descriptions are introduced as explicit semantic anchors to better align with human intent. An asynchronous dual-process architecture, together with a Floor-Room-Area-Object hierarchy, decouples geometric segmentation from time-consuming semantic reasoning. An event-triggered map update mechanism reorganizes the graph only when meaningful semantic events occur. This strategy enables our graph to maintain long-term consistency with relatively low computational overhead. For retrieval, we deploy multi-role Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose queries into atomic constraints and handle logical negations, and employ a hard-to-soft filtering strategy to ensure robust reasoning. This explicit interpretability improves the success rate and reliability of complex retrievals, enabling the system to adapt to a broader spectrum of human interaction tasks. We evaluate INHerit-SG on a newly constructed dataset, HM3DSem-SQR, and in real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex queries, and reveal its scalability for downstream navigation tasks.

While existing applications of the HDP predominantly focus on the Dirichlet-multinomial conjugate structure, the framework itself is considerably more general and, in principle, accommodates a broad class of conjugate prior-likelihood pairs. In particular, exponential family distributions offer a unified and analytically tractable modeling paradigm that encompasses many commonly used distributions. In this paper, we investigate analytic results for two important members of the exponential family within the HDP framework: the Poisson distribution and the normal distribution. We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the corresponding Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs under the hierarchical Dirichlet process construction. Detailed derivations and proofs are provided to clarify the underlying mathematical structure and to demonstrate how conjugacy can be systematically exploited in hierarchical nonparametric models.

As most studies consider synthetic data, it is not clear whether training data mismatch (``domain shift'') or forward model mismatch complicate their successful application to experimental data. We measured CT data from a physical phantom resembling the synthetic Shepp-Logan phantom and trained diffusion priors on synthetic image data sets with different degrees of domain shift towards it. Then, we employed the priors in a Decomposed Diffusion Sampling scheme on sparse-view CT data sets with increasing difficulty leading to the experimental data. Our results reveal that domain shift plays a nuanced role: while severe mismatch causes model collapse and hallucinations, diverse priors outperform well-matched but narrow priors. Forward model mismatch pulls the image samples away from the prior manifold, which causes artifacts but can be mitigated with annealed likelihood schedules that also increase computational efficiency.

Real-Time Chunking (RTC) alleviates this issue but is external to the policy, leading to spurious multimodal switching and trajectories that are not intrinsically smooth. We propose Legato, a training-time continuation method for action-chunked flow-based VLA policies. Specifically, Legato initializes denoising from a schedule-shaped mixture of known actions and noise, exposing the model to partial action information. Moreover, Legato reshapes the learned flow dynamics to ensure that the denoising process remains consistent between training and inference under per-step guidance. Legato further uses randomized schedule condition during training to support varying inference delays and achieve controllable smoothness. Empirically, Legato produces smoother trajectories and reduces spurious multimodal switching during execution, leading to less hesitation and shorter task completion time.

This problem is often addressed by proposing an ad-hoc feature set for a particular swarm behaviour context, usually without further consideration of the solution's resilience outside of the conceived context. Yet, the development of automatic methods to design swarm behaviours is dependent on the ability to measure quantitatively the similarity of swarm behaviours. Hence, we investigate the impact of feature sets for collective behaviours. We select swarm feature sets and similarity measures from prior swarm robotics works, which mainly considered a narrow behavioural context and assess their robustness.

Depending on the input, they may over-rely on linguistic priors relative to visual evidence, or conversely over-attend to visually salient but facts in textual contexts. Prior work has applied a uniform steering intensity to adjust the modality preference of MLLMs. However, strong steering can impair standard inference and increase error rates, whereas weak steering is often ineffective. In addition, because steering sensitivity varies substantially across multimodal instances, a single global strength is difficult to calibrate. To address this limitation with minimal disruption to inference, we introduce an instance-aware diagnostic metric that quantifies each modality's information contribution and reveals sample-specific susceptibility to steering. Building on these insights, we propose a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module that infers scaling patterns, enabling instance-aware control of modality preference. Experimental results show that our instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u4f4e\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u5e72\u9884\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u8c03\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u654f\u611f\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u6216\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u6837\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u7f29\u653e\u5e72\u9884\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u4e00\u5e72\u9884\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5236\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u56fa\u5b9a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Recent training-free approaches have attempted to overcome this constraint by introducing interventions during the denoising process; however, these methods incur substantial computational overhead, often requiring more than five minutes to produce a single 4K image. In this paper, we present PixelRush, the first tuning-free framework for practical high-resolution text-to-image generation. Our method builds upon the established patch-based inference paradigm but eliminates the need for multiple inversion and regeneration cycles. Instead, PixelRush enables efficient patch-based denoising within a low-step regime. To address artifacts introduced by patch blending in few-step generation, we propose a seamless blending strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate over-smoothing effects through a noise injection mechanism. PixelRush delivers exceptional efficiency, generating 4K images in approximately 20 seconds representing a 10$\\times$ to 35$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining superior visual fidelity.

In this paper, we present a learning-based control framework for a pneumatically actuated soft quadruped equipped with tactile suction-cup feet, and we validate the approach experimentally on physical hardware. The control policy is trained in simulation through a staged learning process that starts from a reference gait and is progressively refined under randomized environmental conditions. The resulting controller maps proprioceptive and tactile feedback to coordinated pneumatic actuation and suction-cup commands, enabling closed-loop locomotion on flat and inclined surfaces. When deployed on the real robot, the closed-loop policy outperforms an open-loop baseline, increasing forward speed by 41% on a flat surface and by 91% on a 5-degree incline.

By supervising these two components and enforcing their orthogonality during training, our model preserves label information while exposing domain-specific variation at the same time for more accurate predictions than most feature alignment models. More importantly, it offers human-understandable explanations by mapping sparse latent dimensions to medical concepts and quantifying their contributions via targeted ablations.

Fully-supervised counting methods require costly point-level annotations per object. Few weakly-supervised methods leverage only image-level object counts as supervision and achieve fairly promising results. They are, however, often limited to counting a single category, e.g. person. In this paper, we propose WS-COC, the first MLLM-driven weakly-supervised framework for class-agnostic object counting. Instead of directly fine-tuning MLLMs to predict object counts, which can be challenging due to the modality gap, we incorporate three simple yet effective strategies to bootstrap the counting paradigm in both training and testing: First, a divide-and-discern dialogue tuning strategy is proposed to guide the MLLM to determine whether the object count falls within a specific range and progressively break down the range through multi-round dialogue. Second, a compare-and-rank count optimization strategy is introduced to train the MLLM to optimize the relative ranking of multiple images according to their object counts. Third, a global-and-local counting enhancement strategy aggregates and fuses local and global count predictions to improve counting performance in dense scenes. Extensive experiments on FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech show that WS-COC matches or even surpasses many state-of-art fully-supervised methods while significantly reducing annotation costs.

In practice, however, expert specialization often fails: some experts become functionally similar, while others functioning as de facto shared experts, limiting the effective capacity and model performance. In this work, we analysis from a spectral perspective on parameter and gradient spaces, uncover that (1) experts share highly overlapping dominant spectral components in their parameters, (2) dominant gradient subspaces are strongly aligned across experts, driven by ubiquitous low-rank structure in human corpus, and (3) gating mechanisms preferentially route inputs along these dominant directions, further limiting specialization. To address this, we propose Spectral-Decoupled MoE (SD-MoE), which decomposes both parameter and gradient in the spectral space.

However, the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds poses challenges to reconstruction accuracy. This limitation frequently causes high-frequency detail loss in complex surface microstructures when relying solely on routine strategies. To address this limitation, we propose GSM-GS: a synergistic optimization framework integrating single-view adaptive sub-region weighting constraints and multi-view spatial structure refinement. For single-view optimization, we leverage image gradient features to partition scenes into texture-rich and texture-less sub-regions. The reconstruction quality is enhanced through adaptive filtering mechanisms guided by depth discrepancy features. This preserves high-weight regions while implementing a dual-branch constraint strategy tailored to regional texture variations, thereby improving geometric detail characterization. For multi-view optimization, we introduce a geometry-guided cross-view point cloud association method combined with a dynamic weight sampling strategy. This constructs 3D structural normal constraints across adjacent point cloud frames, effectively reinforcing multi-view consistency and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves both competitive rendering quality and geometric reconstruction.

However, existing approaches falter in zero-shot generalization: end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often lack the precision required for long-horizon tasks, while traditional hierarchical planners suffer from semantic rigidity when facing open-world variations. To address this, we present UniManip, a framework grounded in a Bi-level Agentic Operational Graph (AOG) that unifies semantic reasoning and physical grounding. By coupling a high-level Agentic Layer for task orchestration with a low-level Scene Layer for dynamic state representation, the system continuously aligns abstract planning with geometric constraints, enabling robust zero-shot execution. Unlike static pipelines, UniManip operates as a dynamic agentic loop: it actively instantiates object-centric scene graphs from unstructured perception, parameterizes these representations into collision-free trajectories via a safety-aware local planner, and exploits structured memory to autonomously diagnose and recover from execution failures. Extensive experiments validate the system's robust zero-shot capability on unseen objects and tasks, demonstrating a 22.5% and 25.0% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA and hierarchical baselines, respectively. Notably, the system enables direct zero-shot transfer from fixed-base setups to mobile manipulation without fine-tuning or reconfiguration.

The approach preserves standard FedAvg server aggregation, adds only element-wise operations with amortizable overhead, and allows independent toggling of each component.

Most medical large vision language models (LVLMs) perform visual inspection only once and then rely on text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which operates purely in the linguistic space and is prone to hallucination. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing visually related coordinates, such as bounding boxes. However, these remain a pseudo-visual solution: coordinates are still text and fail to preserve rich visual details like texture and density. Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions. Experimental results on advanced closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that report generation guided by multimodal CoT significantly outperforms that guided by text-only CoT in clinical accuracy and report quality (e.g., 6\\% increase in the RadGraph metric), confirming that high-fidelity interleaved vision language evidence is a non-substitutable component of reliable medical AI. Furthermore, benchmarking across seven state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs demonstrates that models fine-tuned on MMRad-IVL-22K achieve superior reasoning consistency and report quality compared with both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs. The project page is available at https://github.com/qiuzyc/thinking_like_a_radiologist.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u89e3\u8bfb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u9519\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u96c6MMRad-IVL-22K\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u7597\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5355\u6b21\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u67e5\u540e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6613\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5750\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaMMRad-IVL-22K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b21,994\u6761\u6a21\u62df\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u4ea4\u9519\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8986\u76d635\u4e2a\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001CoT\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6587\u672cCoT\u63d0\u53476% RadGraph\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u62a5\u544a\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u8d8a\u901a\u7528\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u533b\u7597\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4ea4\u9519\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc1\u636e\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u533b\u7597AI\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0cMMRad-IVL-22K\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u533b\u7597\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As the robots move throughout the environment and towards their goal, the optimal route is continuously revised as the sensors perceive new information. In traditional autonomous navigation architectures, a regional motion planner will consume the environment map and output a trajectory for the local motion planner to use as a reference. Due to the continuous revision of the regional plan guidance as a result of changing map information, the reference trajectories which are passed down to the local planner can differ significantly across sequential planning cycles. This rapidly changing guidance can result in unsafe navigation behavior, often requiring manual safety interventions during autonomous traversals in off-road environments. To remedy this problem, we propose Temporally-Sampled Efficiently Adaptive State Lattices (TSEASL), which is a regional planner arbitration architecture that considers updated and optimized versions of previously generated trajectories against the currently generated trajectory. When tested on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog Unmanned Ground Vehicle as well as real map data collected from the Warthog, results indicate that when running TSEASL, the robot did not require manual interventions in the same locations where the robot was running the baseline planner. Additionally, higher levels of planner stability were recorded with TSEASL over the baseline. The paper concludes with a discussion of further improvements to TSEASL in order to make it more generalizable to various off-road autonomy scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTSEASL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u533a\u57df\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u79bb\u7ebf\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u56e0\u5730\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u5267\u70c8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u533a\u57df\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u56e0\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4fe1\u606f\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u9891\u7e41\u5267\u70c8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7a33\u5b9a\u89c4\u5212\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTSEASL\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f53\u524d\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ef2\u88c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728Warthog\u65e0\u4eba\u8f66\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cTSEASL\u5728\u57fa\u7ebf\u5931\u8d25\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u89c4\u5212\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "TSEASL\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u79bb\u7ebf\u5bfc\u822a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u66f4\u591a\u8d8a\u91ce\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Recent findings suggest that RLVR primarily functions by eliciting latent capabilities, motivating the development of verifier-free algorithms. However, in such settings, standard methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization face a critical challenge: destructive gradient variance that often leads to training collapse. To address this issue, we introduceVerifier-Independent Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (VI-CuRL), a framework that leverages the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers. By prioritizing high-confidence samples, VI-CuRL effectively manages the bias-variance trade-off, specifically targeting the reduction of action and problem variance. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that our estimator guarantees asymptotic unbiasedness.

The inherent flexibility, adaptability, and safety of soft robots make them ideal for applications that require delicate, organic, and lifelike movement, allowing for immersive and responsive interactions. This study explores the intersection of human emotions, soft robotics, and art to establish and create new forms of human emotion-mediated soft robotic art. In this paper, we introduce two soft embodiments: a soft character and a soft flower as an art display that dynamically responds to brain signals based on alpha waves, reflecting different emotion levels. We present how human emotions can be measured as alpha waves based on brain/EEG signals, how we map the alpha waves to the dynamic movements of the two soft embodiments, and demonstrate our proposed concept using experiments. The findings of this study highlight how soft robotics can embody human emotional states, offering a new medium for insightful artistic expression and interaction, and demonstrating how art displays can be embodied.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u7eea\u901a\u8fc7\u8111\u7535\u03b1\u6ce2\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u827a\u672f\u88c5\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e0\u5176\u67d4\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u60c5\u611f\u4ea4\u4e92\u827a\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u60c5\u7eea\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7EEG\u91c7\u96c6\u03b1\u6ce2\u60c5\u7eea\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6620\u5c04\u81f3\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4f53\u5b9e\u4f53\uff08\u8f6f\u4f53\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4f53\u82b1\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u60c5\u7eea-\u8fd0\u52a8\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8111\u7535\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u827a\u672f\u88c5\u7f6e\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u53ef\u88ab\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60c5\u611f\u827a\u672f\u7684\u65b0\u5a92\u4ecb\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u827a\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

We attribute this gap to a pre-routing bottleneck: multi-head attention concatenates head-specific signals into a single post-attention router input, forcing routing to act on co-occurring feature compositions rather than separable head channels. We show that this router input simultaneously encodes multiple separately decodable semantic and structural factors with uneven head support, and that different feature compositions induce weakly aligned parameter-gradient directions; as a result, routing maps many distinct compositions to the same route. We quantify this collision effect via a route-wise effective composition number $N_{eff}$ and find that higher $N_{eff}$ is associated with larger old-task loss increases after continual training. Motivated by these findings, we propose MH-MoE, which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations to increase routing granularity and reduce composition collisions.

However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy.

However, effectively grounding this knowledge in robot behaviors remains an open challenge. Prior methods often employ a hierarchical approach where VLMs reason over high-level commands to be executed by separate low-level policies, e.g., vision-language-action models (VLAs). The interface between VLMs and VLAs is usually natural language task instructions, which fundamentally limits how much VLM reasoning can steer low-level behavior. We thus introduce Steerable Policies: VLAs trained on rich synthetic commands at various levels of abstraction, like subtasks, motions, and grounded pixel coordinates. By improving low-level controllability, Steerable Policies can unlock pretrained knowledge in VLMs, enabling improved task generalization. We demonstrate this benefit by controlling our Steerable Policies with both a learned high-level embodied reasoner and an off-the-shelf VLM prompted to reason over command abstractions via in-context learning.

This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness.

Here, we tackle prehensile manipulation, in which tasks involve grasping an object before performing various post-grasp motions. Human videos offer strong signals for learning the post-grasp motions, but they are less useful for learning the prerequisite grasping behaviors, especially for robots without human-like hands. A promising way forward is to use a modular policy design, leveraging a dedicated grasp generator to produce stable grasps. However, arbitrary stable grasps are often not task-compatible, hindering the robot's ability to perform the desired downstream motion. To address this challenge, we present Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI), a framework for training a modular manipulation policy using human video motion data processed by paired grasp-trajectory filtering in simulation. This simulation step extends the trajectory data with grasp suitability labels, which allows for supervised learning of task-oriented grasping capabilities. We show through real-world experiments that our framework can be used to learn precise manipulation skills efficiently without any robot data, resulting in significantly more robust performance than using a grasp generator naively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPSI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u6293\u53d6-\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6293\u540e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u624b\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6293\u53d6\u5e38\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42", "method": "Perceive-Simulate-Imitate (PSI) \u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u5bf9\u6293\u53d6-\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u6293\u53d6\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6734\u7d20\u6293\u53d6\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u7b5b\u9009\u662f\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u517c\u5bb9\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84"}}

However, the success of existing TWI methods heavily relies on the assumption that interleaved image-text CoTs are faultless, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of multimodal understanding. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT). Specifically, NT refers to the imperfect visual cues mining and answer reasoning process. As the saying goes, ``One mistake leads to another'', erroneous interleaved CoT would cause error accumulation, thus significantly degrading the performance of MLLMs. To solve the NT problem, we propose a novel method dubbed Reliable Thinking with Images (RTWI). In brief, RTWI estimates the reliability of visual cues and textual CoT in a unified text-centric manner and accordingly employs robust filtering and voting modules to prevent NT from contaminating the final answer.

Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDEG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6210\u529f\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u9650\u5236RL\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763", "method": "DEG\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u96c6\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u903c\u8fd1\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891", "result": "\u572818\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDEG\u65e2\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u7a00\u758f\u6210\u529f\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u72ec\u7acb\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548RL\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u655b", "conclusion": "DEG\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RL\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

While PAC-Bayes bounds (probably approximately correct) typically give bounds for the generalization error that hold with high probability, MAC-Bayes bounds have a similar form but bound the expected generalization error instead. The family of bounds we propose can be understood as a generalization of an expectation version of known PAC-Bayes bounds. Compared to standard PAC-Bayes bounds, the new bounds contain divergence terms that only depend on subsets (or \\emph{blocks}) of the training data. The proposed MAC-Bayes bounds hold the promise of significantly improving upon the tightness of traditional PAC-Bayes and MAC-Bayes bounds. This is illustrated with a simple numerical example in which the original PAC-Bayes bound is vacuous regardless of the choice of prior, while the proposed family of bounds are finite for appropriate choices of the block size. We also explore the question whether high-probability versions of our MAC-Bayes bounds (i.e., PAC-Bayes bounds of a similar form) are possible. We answer this question in the negative with an example that shows that in general, it is not possible to establish a PAC-Bayes bound which (a) vanishes with a rate faster than $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\log n)$ whenever the proposed MAC-Bayes bound vanishes with rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and (b) exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the permitted error probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u7c7b\u65b0\u7684MAC-Bayes\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u671f\u671b\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPAC-Bayes\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u7248\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPAC-Bayes\u8fb9\u754c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u671f\u671b\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u53ef\u66f4\u7d27\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\uff08\u5206\u5757\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u671f\u671b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u9020\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5757\u7684MAC-Bayes\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5757\u5185\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6563\u5ea6\u9879\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u671f\u671b\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u8fb9\u754c\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4f8b\u5b50\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff08\u4f20\u7edf\u8fb9\u754c\u4e3a\u65e0\u7a77\uff0c\u65b0\u8fb9\u754c\u6709\u9650\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u4e3aO(n^{-1/2})\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660e\u65e0\u6cd5\u6784\u9020\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387PAC-Bayes\u7248\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "MAC-Bayes\u8fb9\u754c\u5728\u671f\u671b\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPAC-Bayes\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u7248\u672c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u671f\u671b\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning.

As this paradigm evolves toward larger models and relational foundation models, scalable and realistic benchmarks are essential for enabling systematic evaluation and progress.

RelBench v2 adds four large-scale relational datasets spanning scholarly publications, enterprise resource planning, consumer platforms, and clinical records, increasing the benchmark to 11 datasets comprising over 22 million rows across 29 tables. We further introduce autocomplete tasks, a new class of predictive objectives that require models to infer missing attribute values directly within relational tables while respecting temporal constraints, expanding beyond traditional forecasting tasks constructed via SQL queries. In addition, RelBench v2 expands beyond its native datasets by integrating external benchmarks and evaluation frameworks: we translate event streams from the Temporal Graph Benchmark into relational schemas for unified relational-temporal evaluation, interface with ReDeLEx to provide uniform access to 70+ real-world databases suitable for pretraining, and incorporate 4DBInfer datasets and tasks to broaden multi-table prediction coverage.

Intrapartum biometry plays a critical role in monitoring labor progression; however, the routine use of ultrasound in resource-limited settings is hindered by a shortage of trained sonographers. To address this challenge, the Intrapartum Ultrasound Grand Challenge (IUGC), co-hosted with MICCAI 2024, was launched. The IUGC introduces a clinically oriented multi-task automatic measurement framework that integrates standard plane classification, fetal head-pubic symphysis segmentation, and biometry, enabling algorithms to exploit complementary task information for more accurate estimation. Furthermore, the challenge releases the largest multi-center intrapartum ultrasound video dataset to date, comprising 774 videos (68,106 frames) collected from three hospitals, providing a robust foundation for model training and evaluation. In this study, we present a comprehensive overview of the challenge design, review the submissions from eight participating teams, and analyze their methods from five perspectives: preprocessing, data augmentation, learning strategy, model architecture, and post-processing. In addition, we perform a systematic analysis of the benchmark results to identify key bottlenecks, explore potential solutions, and highlight open challenges for future research. Although encouraging performance has been achieved, our findings indicate that the field remains at an early stage, and further in-depth investigation is required before large-scale clinical deployment.

We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.\n  Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.\n  The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction.

Although federated learning (FL) has gained prominence as a privacy-preserving framework for distributed IoT environments, current federated principal component analysis (PCA) methods lack the integration of personalization and robustness, which are critical for effective anomaly detection. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient personalized federated PCA (FedEP) method for anomaly detection in IoT networks. The proposed model achieves personalization through introducing local representations with the $\\ell_1$-norm for element-wise sparsity, while maintaining robustness via enforcing local models with the $\\ell_{2,1}$-norm for row-wise sparsity. To solve this non-convex problem, we develop a manifold optimization algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) with rigorous theoretical convergence guarantees. Experimental results confirm that the proposed FedEP outperforms the state-of-the-art FedPG, achieving excellent F1-scores and accuracy in various IoT security scenarios.

While Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong unification potential, existing approaches fail to adapt them into a single end-to-end backbone and lack effective knowledge distillation strategies for edge deployment. To address these limitations, we propose MLLMEmbed-ReID, a unified framework based on a powerful cloud-edge architecture. First, we adapt a foundational MLLM into a state-of-the-art cloud model. We leverage instruction-based prompting to guide the MLLM in generating a unified embedding space across RGB, infrared, sketch, and text modalities. This model is then trained efficiently with a hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation finetuning (LoRA-SFT) strategy, optimized under a holistic cross-modal alignment objective. Second, to deploy its knowledge onto an edge-native student, we introduce a novel distillation strategy motivated by the low-rank property in the teacher's feature space. To prioritize essential information, this method employs a Principal Component Mapping loss, while relational structures are preserved via a Feature Relation loss. Our lightweight edge-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual CM-ReID benchmarks, while its cloud-based counterpart excels across all CM-ReID benchmarks. The MLLMEmbed-ReID framework thus presents a complete and effective solution for deploying unified MLLM-level intelligence on resource-constrained devices.

While prior work focuses on training objectives or individual solvers, the holistic design of sampling, specifically solver selection and scheduling, remains dominated by static heuristics. In this work, we revisit this challenge through a geometric lens, proposing SDM, a principled framework that aligns the numerical solver with the intrinsic properties of the diffusion trajectory. By analyzing the ODE dynamics, we show that efficient low-order solvers suffice in early high-noise stages while higher-order solvers can be progressively deployed to handle the increasing non-linearity of later stages. Furthermore, we formalize the scheduling by introducing a Wasserstein-bounded optimization framework. This method systematically derives adaptive timesteps that explicitly bound the local discretization error, ensuring the sampling process remains faithful to the underlying continuous dynamics. Without requiring additional training or architectural modifications, SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, including an FID of 1.93 on CIFAR-10, 2.41 on FFHQ, and 1.98 on AFHQv2, with a reduced number of function evaluations compared to existing samplers.

Benefiting from strong semantic modeling and robust generalization, VLM-based end-to-end approaches have emerged as the mainstream paradigm in recent years. However, these models often suffer from substantial inference latency, as they must auto-regressively generate long token sequences when processing long-form documents. In this work, motivated by the extremely long outputs and complex layout structures commonly found in document parsing, we propose a training-free and highly efficient acceleration method. Inspired by speculative decoding, we employ a lightweight document parsing pipeline as a draft model to predict batches of future tokens, while the more accurate VLM verifies these draft predictions in parallel. Moreover, we further exploit the layout-structured nature of documents by partitioning each page into independent regions, enabling parallel decoding of each region using the same draft-verify strategy.

Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u62a5\u6216\u6f0f\u62a5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\uff08e-process\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bc1\u636e\u5728\u7ebf\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u5931\u8d25\u5e76\u63a7\u5236\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

By embedding state-action pairs into a latent space in which the true value function is approximately linear, our method supports a single set of hyperparameters across diverse domains -- from continuous control with low-dimensional and pixel inputs to high-dimensional Atari games. We prove that, under mild conditions, the fixed point of our embedding-based temporal-difference updates coincides with that of a corresponding linear model-based value expansion, and we derive explicit error bounds relating embedding fidelity to value approximation quality. In practice, ULD employs synchronized updates of encoder, value, and policy networks, auxiliary losses for short-horizon predictive dynamics, and reward-scale normalization to ensure stable learning under sparse rewards. Evaluated on 80 environments spanning Gym locomotion, DeepMind Control (proprioceptive and visual), and Atari, our approach matches or exceeds the performance of specialized model-free and general model-based baselines -- achieving cross-domain competence with minimal tuning and a fraction of the parameter footprint.

This complexity makes it intractable for existing computational methods to effectively capture the interplay between spatial interactions and intrinsic genomic relationships, thus limiting our ability to discern critical biological patterns.

In this paper, we theoretically analyze modality competition and propose a method for multimodal classification by maximizing the total correlation between multimodal features and labels.

It enables dense scene understanding without human annotations, which is especially valuable in domains where labelled data is scarce. However, existing methods often struggle to reconcile global semantic structure with fine-grained boundary accuracy. This paper introduces DynaGuide, an adaptive segmentation framework that addresses these challenges through a novel dual-guidance strategy and dynamic loss optimization. Building on our previous work, DynaSeg, DynaGuide combines global pseudo-labels from zero-shot models such as DiffSeg or SegFormer with local boundary refinement using a lightweight CNN trained from scratch. This synergy allows the model to correct coarse or noisy global predictions and produce high-precision segmentations. At the heart of DynaGuide is a multi-component loss that dynamically balances feature similarity, Huber-smoothed spatial continuity, including diagonal relationships, and semantic alignment with the global pseudo-labels. Unlike prior approaches, DynaGuide trains entirely without ground-truth labels in the target domain and supports plug-and-play integration of diverse guidance sources. Extensive experiments on BSD500, PASCAL VOC2012, and COCO demonstrate that DynaGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU by 17.5% on BSD500, 3.1% on PASCAL VOC2012, and 11.66% on COCO. With its modular design, strong generalization, and minimal computational footprint, DynaGuide offers a scalable and practical solution for unsupervised segmentation in real-world settings.

While this idea is well established, teachers trained with conventional cross-entropy often fail to preserve such signals. Their distributions collapse into sharp, overconfident peaks that appear decisive but are in fact brittle, offering little beyond the hard label or subtly hindering representation-level transfer. This overconfidence is especially problematic in high-cardinality tasks, where the nuances among many plausible classes matter most for guiding a compact student. Moreover, such brittle targets reduce robustness under distribution shift, leaving students vulnerable to miscalibration in real-world conditions. To address this limitation, we revisit distillation from a distributional perspective and propose Calibrated Uncertainty Distillation (CUD), a framework designed to make dark knowledge more faithfully accessible. Instead of uncritically adopting the teacher's overconfidence, CUD encourages teachers to reveal uncertainty where it is informative and guides students to learn from targets that are calibrated rather than sharpened certainty. By directly shaping the teacher's predictive distribution before transfer, our approach balances accuracy and calibration, allowing students to benefit from both confident signals on easy cases and structured uncertainty on hard ones. Across diverse benchmarks, CUD yields students that are not only more accurate, but also more calibrated under shift and more reliable on ambiguous, long-tail inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u84b8\u998f\uff08CUD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6b63\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc7\u81ea\u4fe1\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5c16\u9510\u548c\u81ea\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e22\u5931\u4e86\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7c7b\u522b\u6570\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCUD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u6574\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u5176\u5728\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u5904\u5c55\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6821\u51c6\u800c\u975e\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u4f9b\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "CUD\u4f7f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u517c\u5177\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u6821\u51c6\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u957f\u5c3e\u6837\u672c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u6bd4\u8fc7\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0cCUD\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u6697\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We prove that LWCP preserves finite-sample marginal validity for any weight function; achieves asymptotically optimal conditional coverage at essentially no width cost when heteroscedasticity factors through leverage; and recovers the form and width of classical prediction intervals under Gaussian assumptions while retaining distribution-free guarantees. We further establish that randomized leverage approximations preserve coverage exactly with controlled width perturbation, and that vanilla CP suffers a persistent, sample-size-independent conditional coverage gap that LWCP eliminates.

Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a12\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "MLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "MLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u76f4\u89c2\u6027\u3002"}}

This benchmark reframes food portion estimation as an implicit-scale 3D reconstruction problem under monocular observations. To reflect real-world conditions, explicit physical references and metric annotations are removed; instead, contextual objects such as plates and utensils are provided, requiring algorithms to infer scale from implicit cues and prior knowledge. The dataset emphasizes multi-food scenes with diverse object geometries, frequent occlusions, and complex spatial arrangements. The benchmark was adopted as a challenge at the MetaFood 2025 Workshop, where multiple teams proposed reconstruction-based solutions.

However, purely data-driven models often require extensive training data and can generalize poorly, especially in small-data regimes and under unseen (out-of-distribution) input functions that are not represented in the training data. To address these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO), which enhances the Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) by embedding governing physics into training through PDE, boundary condition, and initial condition residuals. To improve expressivity, we first introduce an Advanced LNO (ALNO) backbone that retains a pole-residue transient representation while replacing the steady-state branch with an FNO-style Fourier multiplier. To make physics-informed training both data-efficient and robust, PILNO further leverages (i) virtual inputs: an unlabeled ensemble of input functions spanning a broad spectral range that provides abundant physics-only supervision and explicitly targets out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes; and (ii) temporal-causality weighting: a time-decaying reweighting of the physics residual that prioritizes early-time dynamics and stabilizes optimization for time-dependent PDEs. Across four representative benchmarks -- Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, a reaction-diffusion system, and a forced KdV equation -- PILNO consistently improves accuracy in small-data settings (e.g., N_train <= 27), reduces run-to-run variability across random seeds, and achieves stronger OOD generalization than purely data-driven baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPhysics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u865a\u62df\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684ALNO\u9aa8\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165PDE/\u8fb9\u754c/\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u6b8b\u5dee\u3001\u865a\u62df\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6b8b\u5dee\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aPDE\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cPILNO\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\uff08N_train<=27\uff09\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PILNO\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u662f\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u4e0bPDE\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

However, most existing VFL frameworks rely on the idealized assumption of full sample alignment across participants, a premise that rarely holds in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces Split-MoPE, a novel framework that integrates Split Learning with a specialized Mixture of Predefined Experts (MoPE) architecture. Unlike standard Mixture of Experts (MoE), where routing is learned dynamically, MoPE uses predefined experts to process specific data alignments, effectively maximizing data usage during both training and inference without requiring full sample overlap. By leveraging pretrained encoders for target data domains, Split-MoPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in a single communication round, significantly reducing the communication footprint compared to multi-round end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike existing proposals that address sample misalignment, this novel architecture provides inherent robustness against malicious or noisy participants and offers per-sample interpretability by quantifying each collaborator's contribution to each prediction. Extensive evaluations on vision (CIFAR-10/100) and tabular (Breast Cancer Wisconsin) datasets demonstrate that Split-MoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as LASER and Vertical SplitNN, particularly in challenging scenarios with high data missingness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Split-MoPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5047\u8bbe\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u6837\u672c\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408Split Learning\u4e0e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff08MoPE\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6570\u636e\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10/100\u548c\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cSplit-MoPE\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eLASER\u548cVertical SplitNN\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u6297\u6076\u610f\u8282\u70b9\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Split-MoPE\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

In contrast, self-supervised speech encoders such as WavLM provide strong acoustic representations yet remain opaque discriminative models with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools), a framework that reframes emotion recognition as a multi-turn inquiry process rather than a single-pass prediction. ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise. Finally, we integrate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an Evidence Trust Gate to explicitly couple tool-usage behaviors with prediction quality and enforce evidence-grounded reasoning.

While structured pruning can address these issues by removing redundant filters, existing methods typically rely on manually tuned hyperparameters such as pruning ratios which limit scalability and generalization across datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic Structured Pruning (DSP), a fully automatic, structured pruning framework for convolution-based TSC models. DSP introduces an instance-wise sparsity loss during training to induce channel-level sparsity, followed by a global activation analysis to identify and prune redundant filters without needing any predefined pruning ratio. This work tackles computational bottlenecks of deep TSC models for deployment on resource-constrained devices. We validate DSP on 128 UCR datasets using two different deep state-of-the-art architectures: LITETime and InceptionTime. Our approach achieves an average compression of 58% for LITETime and 75% for InceptionTime architectures while maintaining classification accuracy.

Anomaly detection is typically formulated as a one-class classification problem, where the training data consists solely of nominal values, leaving methods built on this assumption susceptible to training label noise. We present a dataset folding method that transforms an arbitrary one-class classifier-based anomaly detector into a fully unsupervised method. This is achieved by making a set of key weak assumptions: that anomalies are uncommon in the training dataset and generally heterogeneous. These assumptions enable us to utilize multiple independently trained instances of a one-class classifier to filter the training dataset for anomalies. This transformation requires no modifications to the underlying anomaly detector; the only changes are algorithmically selected data subsets used for training. We demonstrate that our method can transform a wide variety of one-class classifier anomaly detectors for both images and videos into unsupervised ones. Our method creates the first unsupervised logical anomaly detectors by transforming existing methods. We also demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised anomaly detection on the MVTec AD, ViSA, and MVTec Loco AD datasets.

However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility. Beyond providing a useful basis for task-transfer, we show that HSR's temporally extended predictive structure can also be leveraged to drive efficient exploration, effectively scaling to large, procedurally generated environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u540e\u7ee7\u8868\u5f81\uff08HSR\uff09\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7ecf\u5178SR\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u8c31\u6269\u6563\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178\u540e\u7ee7\u8868\u5f81\uff08SR\uff09\u56e0\u7b56\u7565\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u73af\u5883\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u793a\u8fc7\u65f6\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u8c31\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u5bc6\u96c6\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u62bd\u8c61\u6784\u5efaHSR\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u975e\u8d1f\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\uff08NMF\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u4f4e\u79e9\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "HSR-NMF\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9a71\u52a8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7a0b\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "HSR\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7531\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u5f81\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We identify a critical theoretical flaw in this paradigm: during inference, the model operates in an open-loop manner, consuming its own generated outputs recursively. This leads to inevitable error accumulation (exposure bias), where minor early deviations cascade into significant trajectory drift over long horizons. In this paper, we reformulate autoregressive forecasting through the lens of control theory, proposing \\textbf{F-LLM} (Feedback-driven LLM), a novel closed-loop framework. Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller.

Existing autoregressive models often fail when processing long sequences. They typically anchor poses to the first frame, which leads to attention decay, scale drift, and extrapolation errors. We introduce LongStream, a novel gauge-decoupled streaming visual geometry model for metric-scale scene reconstruction across thousands of frames. Our approach is threefold. First, we discard the first-frame anchor and predict keyframe-relative poses. This reformulates long-range extrapolation into a constant-difficulty local task. Second, we introduce orthogonal scale learning. This method fully disentangles geometry from scale estimation to suppress drift. Finally, we solve Transformer cache issues such as attention-sink reliance and long-term KV-cache contamination. We propose cache-consistent training combined with periodic cache refresh. This approach suppresses attention degradation over ultra-long sequences and reduces the gap between training and inference. Experiments show LongStream achieves state-of-the-art performance. It delivers stable, metric-scale reconstruction over kilometer-scale sequences at 18 FPS.

Objective assessment and validation of these techniques for specific clinically oriented tasks are crucial for their adoption in clinical motion analysis. AI-driven monocular MMC reduces the barriers to adoption in the clinic and has the potential to reduce the overhead for analysis of this common clinical assessment. Nine adult participants with no impairments performed the standardized UERW task, which entails reaching targets distributed across a virtual sphere centered on the torso, with targets displayed in a VR headset. Movements were simultaneously captured using a marker-based motion capture system and a set of eight FLIR cameras. We performed monocular video analysis on two of these video camera views to compare a frontal and offset camera configurations. The frontal camera orientation demonstrated strong agreement with the marker-based reference, exhibiting a minimal mean bias of $0.61 \\pm 0.12$ \\% reachspace reached per octanct (mean $\\pm$ standard deviation). In contrast, the offset camera view underestimated the percent workspace reached ($-5.66 \\pm 0.45$ \\% reachspace reached). Conclusion: The findings support the feasibility of a frontal monocular camera configuration for UERW assessment, particularly for anterior workspace evaluation where agreement with marker-based motion capture was highest. The overall performance demonstrates clinical potential for practical, single-camera assessments. This study provides the first validation of monocular MMC system for the assessment of the UERW task. By reducing technical complexity, this approach enables broader implementation of quantitative upper extremity mobility assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u548cAI\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0a\u80a2\u53ef\u8fbe\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u6b63\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7b80\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "9\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u6210\u4eba\u5b8c\u6210\u865a\u62df\u7403\u9762\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c8\u53f0FLIR\u76f8\u673a\u8bb0\u5f55\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u4e24\u8def\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u6b63\u9762\u548c\u504f\u89d2\uff09\u8fdb\u884cAI\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u4e0e\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u6b63\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff08\u504f\u5dee0.61\u00b10.12%\uff09\uff0c\u504f\u89d2\u89c6\u89d2\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4f30\uff08-5.66\u00b10.45%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u9762\u5355\u76ee\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7ed3\u5408AI\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u80a2\u53ef\u8fbe\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u524d\u5411\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u843d\u5730\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism.

We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters.

While effective at amplifying dominant behaviors, we identify a critical pathology in this alignment process: the systematic suppression of valid but rare (low-likelihood under the base model distribution) reasoning paths. We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a \"Normalization Squeeze,\" where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone. Crucially, on the long-tail subset where coupled RL optimization collapses to 0% pass@k, ARTS uniquely recovers significant performance, suggesting that disentangling verification from generation offers a more robust pathway for solving complex reasoning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faARTS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u7f55\u89c1\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRLVR\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfb\u6c42\u548c\u6709\u9650\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u538b\u5236\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6324\u538b\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAmortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Flow Matching\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u5b88\u6052\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u9ad8\u71b5\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u5728MATH-500\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523074.6% BoN@16\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5d29\u6e83\u81f30%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations.

Ca-MCF utilizes label category flattening to decompose label variables into specific category nodes, enabling precise modeling of causal structures within the label space. Furthermore, we introduce an explanatory competition-based category-aware recovery mechanism that leverages the proposed Specific Category-Specific Mutual Information (SCSMI) and Distinct Category-Specific Mutual Information (DCSMI) to salvage causal features obscured by label correlations. The method also incorporates structural symmetry checks and cross-dimensional redundancy removal to ensure the robustness and compactness of the identified Markov Blankets.

Bias correction and spatial downscaling are fundamental components to develop operational weather forecast systems, as they seek to improve the consistency between coarse-resolution climate model simulations or satellite-based estimates and ground-based observations. In recent years, deep learning-based models have been increasingly replaced traditional statistical methods to generate high-resolution, bias free projections of climate variables. For example, Max-Average U-Net (MAUNet) architecture has been demonstrated for its ability to downscale precipitation estimates. The versatility and adaptability of these neural models make them highly effective across a range of applications, though this often come at the cost of high computational and memory requirements. The aim of this research is to develop light-weight neural network architectures for both bias correction and downscaling of precipitation, for which the teacher-student based learning paradigm is explored. This research demonstrates the adaptability of MAUNet to the task of bias correction, and further introduces a compact, lightweight neural network architecture termed MAUNet-Light.The proposed MAUNet-Light model is developed by transferring knowledge from the trained MAUNet, and it is designed to perform both downscaling and bias correction with reduced computational requirements without any significant loss in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MAUNet-Light\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u964d\u6c34\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53d6\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e1a\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684MAUNet\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3\u8f7b\u91cf\u67b6\u6784MAUNet-Light\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u4e0e\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u3002", "result": "MAUNet-Light\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "MAUNet-Light\u4e3a\u964d\u6c34\u4ea7\u54c1\u540e\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4e1a\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing multi-dimensional data recovery methods leveraging FCTN decomposition still have room for further enhancement, particularly in computational efficiency and modeling capability. To address these issues, we first propose a FCTN-based generalized nonconvex regularization paradigm from the perspective of gradient mapping. Then, reliable and scalable multi-dimensional data recovery models are investigated, where the model formulation is shifted from unquantized observations to coarse-grained quantized observations. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, we derive efficient optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to solve the formulated models. To alleviate the computational bottleneck encountered when processing large-scale multi-dimensional data, fast and efficient randomized compression algorithms are devised in virtue of sketching techniques in numerical linear algebra. These dimensionality-reduction techniques serve as the computational acceleration core of our proposed algorithm framework.

Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u8054\u90a6Granger\u56e0\u679c\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u9012\u63a8\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6Granger\u56e0\u679c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u8f93\u51fa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u7c7b\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08aleatoric\uff09\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff08epistemic\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u8054\u90a6\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u9012\u63a8\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u56db\u4e2a\u65b0\u578b\u4ea4\u53c9\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6536\u655b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u7a33\u6001\u65b9\u5dee\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7a33\u6001\u65b9\u5dee\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u5148\u9a8c\u65e0\u5173\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u5de5\u4e1a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u65ad\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

This study evaluates whether functional MRI-derived regional homogeneity (ReHo) can be used to classify ACAM-J using machine-learning approaches. We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states.

To this end, we perform a comparative analysis across three state-of-the-art probabilistic prediction methods-conformalised quantile regression, natural gradient boosting and conditional diffusion models-all of which can be combined with tree-based machine learning. The methods are validated using four years of data for all wind farms present within the Belgian offshore zone. Additionally, the point forecasts are benchmarked against deterministic engineering methods, using either the power curve or an advanced approach incorporating a calibrated analytical wake model. The experimental results show that the machine learning methods improve the mean absolute error by up to 53% and 33% compared to the power curve and the calibrated wake model.

While lightweight architectures like MobileNet improve efficiency, they still demand thousands of parameters, limiting deployment on textile-integrated platforms. We introduce a convexified attention mechanism for wearable applications that dynamically weights features while preserving convexity through nonexpansive simplex projection and convex loss functions. Unlike conventional attention mechanisms using non-convex softmax operations, our approach employs Euclidean projection onto the probability simplex combined with multi-class hinge loss, ensuring global convergence guarantees. Implemented on a textile-based capacitive sensor with four connection points, our approach achieves 100.00\\% accuracy on tap gestures and 100.00\\% on swipe gestures -- consistent across 10-fold cross-validation and held-out test evaluation -- while requiring only 120--360 parameters, a 97\\% reduction compared to conventional approaches. With sub-millisecond inference times (290--296$\u03bc$s) and minimal storage requirements ($<$7KB), our method enables gesture interfaces directly within e-textiles without external processing. Our evaluation, conducted in controlled laboratory conditions with a single-user dataset, demonstrates feasibility for basic gesture interactions. Real-world deployment would require validation across multiple users, environmental conditions, and more complex gesture vocabularies.

However, existing approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap: producing equations that fit observations well but remain inconsistent with fundamental scientific principles. A key reason is that these approaches are dominated by empirical risk minimization, lacking explicit constraints to ensure scientific consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations.

In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors.

These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems.

However, such data are often difficult to obtain.

In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMobTA\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u65e0\u76ee\u6807\u57ce\u5e02\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6e90\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u548c\u516c\u4ea4\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u57ce\u5e02\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u76ee\u6807\u57ce\u5e02\u771f\u5b9e\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5f97\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "MobTA\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u57ce\u5e02\u516c\u4ea4\u65f6\u523b\u8868\u4e0e\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u57ce\u5e02\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "MobTA\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MobTA\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4efb\u52a1\u7b97\u672f\u5728\u8de8\u57ce\u5e02\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge, thereby shielding the pre-training encoder from the adverse effects of cross-domain discrepancies. For downstream tasks, we further design a Task-oriented Expert Fusion Strategy that adaptively integrates multiple experts based on their discriminative strengths.

While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns.

To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions.

The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permutation equivariance and ability to deal with sparsity and variable-sized inputs. However, existing work is either largely empirical and lacks formal guarantees or it focuses solely on expressivity, leaving open the question of when and how such architectures generalize beyond a finite training set. In this work, we propose a general theoretical framework that characterizes the sufficient conditions under which MPNNs can learn an algorithm from a training set of small instances and provably approximate its behavior on inputs of arbitrary size. Our framework applies to a broad class of algorithms, including single-source shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and general dynamic programming problems, such as the $0$-$1$ knapsack problem. In addition, we establish impossibility results for a wide range of algorithmic tasks, showing that standard MPNNs cannot learn them, and we derive more expressive MPNN-like architectures that overcome these limitations. Finally, we refine our analysis for the Bellman-Ford algorithm, yielding a substantially smaller required training set and significantly extending the recent work of Nerem et al. [2025] by allowing for a differentiable regularization loss.

However, their discrete, highly non-linear behavior makes them difficult to explain, validate and formally verify. As a result, BNNs remain largely opaque, limiting their suitability in safety-critical domains, where causal transparency and behavioral guarantees are essential. In this work, we introduce a Petri net (PN)-based framework that captures the BNN's internal operations as event-driven processes. By \"eventizing\" their operations, we expose their causal relationships and dependencies for a fine-grained analysis of concurrency, ordering, and state evolution. Here, we construct modular PN blueprints for core BNN components including activation, gradient computation and weight updates, and compose them into a complete system-level model. We then validate the composed PN against a reference software-based BNN, verify it against reachability and structural checks to establish 1-safeness, deadlock-freeness, mutual exclusion and correct-by-construction causal sequencing, before we assess its scalability and complexity at segment, component, and system levels using the automated measurement tools in Workcraft.

We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods.

We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlashSchNet\u901a\u8fc7IO\u4f18\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347GNN\u5206\u5b50\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u7ecf\u5178\u529b\u573a\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGNN\u52bf\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u788e\u7247\u5316\u6838\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u5bfc\u81f4GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u529b\u573a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlashSchNet\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u91cdIO\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u5f84\u5411\u57fa\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u878d\u5408\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u3001CSR\u5206\u6bb5\u5f52\u7ea6\u805a\u5408\u3001\u901a\u9053\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728RTX PRO 6000\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52301000 ns/\u5929\u6a21\u62df\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u6bd4CGSchNet\u5feb6.5\u500d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c1180%\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8aMARTINI\u7b49\u7ecf\u5178\u529b\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "IO\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u63d0\u5347GNN-MD\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0cFlashSchNet\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}

However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0).

However, existing learning-based approaches for hard combinatorial optimization tasks often rely on supervised training data, reinforcement learning, or gradient estimators, leading to significant computational overhead, unstable training, or a lack of provable performance guarantees. In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training.
