### [2] [Oracle-RLAIF: An Improved Fine-Tuning Framework for Multi-modal Video Models through Reinforcement Learning from Ranking Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02561)
*Derek Shi,Ruben Glatt,Christine Klymko,Shubham Mohole,Hongjun Choi,Shashank Kushwaha,Sam Sakla,Felipe Leno da Silva*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Oracle-RLAIF框架，用排序模型替代奖励模型，结合新损失函数GRPO_rank，实现更高效低成本的视频语言模型对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLAIF依赖训练奖励模型，成本高且受限；需要更经济高效的对齐方法。

Method: 引入Oracle-RLAIF，使用通用排序器替代奖励模型，并提出基于GRPO的排序损失函数GRPO_rank，直接优化序数反馈。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准上，Oracle-RLAIF显著超越现有方法，实现更优性能。

Conclusion: Oracle-RLAIF为多模态视频模型提供了一种灵活、数据高效、基于排序而非打分的强化学习对齐新路径。

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive
fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual
comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video
comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of
gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,
recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),
which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks
rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create
calibrated scalar rewards-- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose
Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a
more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate
model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce
$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware
advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently
outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated
across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to
creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal
video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Method: 采用像素即射线策略将2D关键点转为3D空间射线，联合预训练编码器特征输入强化学习策略，并通过专家迁移学习与物理奖励优化。

Result: 在多样场景中生成高保真、符合物理规律的运动，显著优于先前方法的视觉accuracy和物理真实感。

Conclusion: PhysHMR实现了视觉对齐与物理合理性的统一，无需后处理，为单目人体运动重建提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos
remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods
primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to
unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such
artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing
following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this
two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework
that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a
physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically
grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our
approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial
rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as
policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy
3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual
features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both
detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of
reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that
transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the
vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated
reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR
produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,
outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

*P. Jonathon Phillips,Geraldine Jeckeln,Carina A. Hahn,Amy N. Yates,Peter C. Fontana,Alice J. O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现人类与机器协同人脸识别时，准确率提升取决于双方基线准确率的接近程度，提出“邻近准确率规则”(PAR)，并设计智能人机融合策略，显著优于纯机器或全人类系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类与AI协同人脸识别的条件和机制，以提升系统整体准确率，避免低性能人类降低系统表现。

Method: 基于专家与非专家的人脸识别数据，分析人-人、人-机协同的准确率变化，提出并验证“邻近准确率规则”(PAR)，并构建智能融合策略与图论优化的人类系统。

Conclusion: 人类与机器在人脸识别中可协同增效，智能选择高潜力人类参与融合能最大化准确率并最小化低性能者干扰，为AI在人脸识别中的合理应用提供实证指导。

Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms
creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between
people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades
accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which
combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy.
Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the
benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of
collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between
collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule
predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline
abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using
the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate
than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was
surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by
selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a
high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine
operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine
judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only
partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated
the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration.
However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the
impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results
demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate
face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the
intelligent use of AI in face identification.

### [5] [How Confident are Video Models? Empowering Video Models to Express their Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02571)
*Zhiting Mei,Ola Shorinwa,Anirudha Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次提出生成式视频模型的不确定性量化框架S-QUBED，通过潜在空间建模分解不确定性，并构建评估指标与数据集以提升模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式视频模型存在幻觉问题，但现有工作缺乏对其不确定性的量化方法，带来安全风险。

Method: 提出S-QUBED框架，基于潜在空间建模分解 Aleatoric 和 Epistemic 不确定性，结合鲁棒秩相关评估指标及专用UQ数据集。

Result: S-QUBED能有效计算校准的总不确定性，且与任务准确率负相关，成功区分两类不确定性成分。

Conclusion: 本工作是视频模型不确定性量化的首次尝试，为未来安全视频生成提供基础工具。

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities,
spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like
large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate,
producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although
uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior
work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns.
To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the
uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty
quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for
evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation
estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method
for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to
rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic
components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in
video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we
disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that
arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark
video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total
uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and
effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

### [6] [PEO: Training-Free Aesthetic Quality Enhancement in Pre-Trained Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Prompt Embedding Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02599)
*Hovhannes Margaryan,Bo Wan,Tinne Tuytelaars*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的提示嵌入优化方法PEO，提升文生图模型的图像美学质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文生图模型在简单提示下生成图像美学质量不足，需提升视觉效果

Method: 通过三重目标函数优化提示嵌入：提升美学 fidelity、保持优化嵌入一致性、最小化与原始提示的偏差

Result: PEO无需训练且兼容任意骨干模型，在定量与定性评估中超越或媲美现有SOTA方法

Conclusion: PEO为低成本高效提升文生图质量提供了新范式，具有广泛应用潜力

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our
method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained
text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of
a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the
generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that
improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to
the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt.
The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally,
PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or
equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt
adaptation methods.

### [7] [Ego-Exo 3D Hand Tracking in the Wild with a Mobile Multi-Camera Rig](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02601)
*Patrick Rim,Kun He,Kevin Harris,Braden Copple,Shangchen Han,Sizhe An,Ivan Shugurov,Tomas Hodan,He Wen,Xu Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无标记多摄像头系统，用于在真实环境中精确捕捉手部与物体的3D姿态，提升环境真实性与标注精度的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集多在受控实验室环境中采集，缺乏环境多样性，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 设计一种轻量级背负式多摄像头系统（8个外摄像头+Meta Quest 3头显），构建ego-exo跟踪流水线，生成高精度3D手部姿态真值。

Result: 收集了一个同步多视图图像与精确3D手部姿态标注的数据集，显著减少环境真实性与标注精度之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 该系统为非受控环境下手部交互建模提供了高质量数据基础，推动了现实场景中 egocentric 视觉的发展。

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in
unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer
vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in
controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model
generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera
system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for
nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a
lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a
user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We
design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground
truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an
annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand
poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce
the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

### [8] [Input-Aware Sparse Attention for Real-Time Co-Speech Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02617)
*Beijia Lu,Ziyi Chen,Jing Xiao,Jun-Yan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过引入基于人体姿态的稀疏注意力和感知输入的蒸馏损失，加速扩散模型并提升视频质量，实现实时音频驱动视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型因多步去噪和昂贵注意力机制导致推理缓慢，无法实时部署。

Method: 提出输入感知的稀疏注意力机制，利用人体姿态关键点引导关注面部、手部等关键区域，并设计输入感知的蒸馏损失以增强口型同步与手势真实感。

Result: 在保持高视频质量的同时实现实时推理，性能优于现有音频驱动和输入驱动方法。

Conclusion: 输入姿态引导的稀疏注意力与蒸馏损失显著提升效率与质量，为实时音频驱动视频生成提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for
various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However,
existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and
costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we
distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model.
Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades
video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these
issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose
conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using
accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention
to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This
input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens
temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and
motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an
input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion
realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss,
our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared
to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive
experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

### [9] [Deep Generative Continual Learning using Functional LoRA: FunLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02631)
*Victor Enescu,Hichem Sahbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FunLoRA，一种基于低秩自适应的高效持续学习方法，显著减少遗忘并降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型增量训练面临灾难性遗忘和合成数据导致的性能下降问题，需更高效的参数微调方法。

Method: 设计FunLoRA，使用秩1矩阵与函数增强的动态条件机制，仅在当前任务数据上训练。

Result: 在流匹配模型上超越扩散模型SOTA，提升分类准确率，大幅降低内存与采样时间。

Conclusion: FunLoRA实现了参数高效、无遗忘的持续生成建模，为实际部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and
critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision
based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging
due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural
networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists
in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to
mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the
continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)
reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance
degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.
In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more
expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank
adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose
reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected
functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic
conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic
forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task.
Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch,
showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching
higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the
memory cost and sampling time.

### [10] [Sequence-Preserving Dual-FoV Defense for Traffic Sign and Light Recognition in Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02642)
*Abhishek Joshi,Jahnavi Krishna Koda,Abhishek Phadke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种双视场、序列保持的鲁棒框架，提升交通灯与标志识别在自然与数字干扰下的安全性，显著降低攻击成功率与高风险误分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型忽视时间连续性、多视场感知及对自然与数字干扰的鲁棒性，易导致危险误分类，影响自动驾驶安全。

Method: 基于aiMotive、Udacity、Waymo及德州自录视频构建多源数据集，提出包含特征压缩、防御性蒸馏、熵异常检测与序列时间投票的三层统一防御框架。

Result: 在4类ODD场景中达到79.8mAP，攻击成功率降至18.2%，高风险误分类减少32%，优于YOLOv8、YOLOv9和BEVFormer。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效增强交通信号识别的鲁棒性与安全性，为自动驾驶系统提供实用且可迁移的防御解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In
addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing
perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous
misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal
continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both
digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,
sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the
USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and
self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of
RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):
highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life
application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer
defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive
distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise
temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included
accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,
and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes
for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved
79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and
BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

*Benjamin Yu,Jackie Liu,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Smart-GRPO方法，通过优化噪声扰动实现流匹配模型的强化学习，提升图像质量和奖励优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型是确定性的，不适合强化学习，而现有随机扰动方法效率低且不稳定。

Method: Smart-GRPO采用迭代搜索策略，解码候选扰动，通过奖励函数评估并优化噪声分布以指向高奖励区域。

Result: 实验表明Smart-GRPO在奖励优化和视觉质量上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Smart-GRPO为流匹配框架中的强化学习提供了实用路径，弥合了高效训练与人类对齐生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image
generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes
them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image
quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by
perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient
and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise
perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO
employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations,
evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution
toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves
both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our
results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching
frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned
generation.

*Yibin Zhao,Yihan Pan,Jun Nan,Jianjun Yi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FSFSplatter，从稀疏自由图像快速重建高质量表面，超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯溅射方法依赖密集标定图像，稀疏图像下因重叠少和过拟合导致表面质量差

Method: 采用大Transformer编码多视角图像，通过自分裂高斯头生成稠密几何一致的高斯初始化，结合贡献剪枝与可微相机参数下的深度与多视角特征监督优化

Result: 在DTU和Replica数据集上优于当前SOTA方法

Conclusion: FSFSplatter有效解决了稀疏图像下的高斯溅射重建难题，实现快速高质量表面重建

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for
its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However,
most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free
sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and
overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface
reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense
Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced
scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to
encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent
Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates
local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to
limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with
differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

*Junyu Shi,Yong Sun,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Zhengjie Zhang,Yuxin He,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGIC提出了一种整合意图建模与视觉先验的统一框架，显著提升文本驱动运动生成的精度与可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉动作执行的因果逻辑与人类意图，且缺乏视觉 grounding，限制了细节精度与个性化生成。

Method: MoGIC联合优化多模态条件运动生成与意图预测，引入自适应范围混合注意力机制，并构建440小时的Mo440H基准数据集。

Result: 在HumanML3D和Mo440H上FID分别降低38.6%和34.6%，超越LLM方法的运动标注性能，并支持意图预测与视觉条件生成。

Conclusion: MoGIC实现了更精准、可控的运动合成与意图理解，推动多模态生成领域发展。

Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a
bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in
capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that
drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and
personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal
details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention
modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly
optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction,
MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance
generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further
introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable
effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences.
To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21
high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC
reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based
methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables
intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable
motion synthesis and intention understanding. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种运动自适应框架，通过基于视觉基础模型的语义与运动先验，动态调整控制点密度，提升单目视频动态3D重建的质量与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏控制方法因仅依据几何分配控制点，导致静态区域冗余、动态区域不足，难以有效建模时变场景。

Method: 利用视觉基础模型建立补丁-词元-节点对应关系，通过运动自适应压缩与迭代体素化和运动倾向评分，集中控制点于动态区域；采用基于样条的轨迹参数化替代MLP变形场，提升时序建模稳定性。

Result: 在重建质量和计算效率上显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 运动自适应控制点分配能有效解决动态3D重建中的密度-复杂度不匹配问题，为高效时变场景建模提供新范式。

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the
ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of
modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods
alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control
points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by
geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a
motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.
Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we
establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive
compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing
redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible
representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion
tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control
point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we
introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets,
replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion
representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on
handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle
to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep
learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise
characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require
extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise
types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,
termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained
networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation
of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised
pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained
network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without
requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned
representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising
performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise
patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited
training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrv-R1是首个专为多模态通用检索设计的R1风格MLLM，通过逐步推理提升检索精度，并解决直接应用DeepSeek-R1方法时的计算开销与训练不稳问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接将DeepSeek-R1应用于检索任务存在高计算成本和RL训练不稳定的问题，亟需针对性优化。

Method: 引入信息压缩模块（含细节检查机制）降低token消耗，并提出两阶段训练范式：先用检索专属合成CoT数据集激活模型，再以课程奖励机制进行RL微调。

Result: Retrv-R1在多个基准上达到SOTA性能，兼具高效率与强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过结构化压缩与课程化RL训练，成功实现多模态检索的高效高精度推理，为R1风格模型拓展至检索任务提供新范式。

Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper
introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for
multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing
step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that
directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not
feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large
token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,
and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to
train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an
information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which
enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while
ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.
Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage
using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective
optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both
performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1
achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,
as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BCA+，一种无需训练的测试时自适应框架，提升视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的识别与检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法或计算开销大，或忽略先验信息，导致性能受限。

Method: BCA+通过动态缓存存储类嵌入、空间尺度和自适应先验，将自适应建模为贝叶斯推断问题，融合初始模型输出与缓存预测（含更新的似然与先验），并引入不确定性引导融合机制。

Result: BCA+在识别和检测基准上达到SOTA性能，且无需反向传播，高效实时。

Conclusion: BCA+通过联合优化似然与先验，有效提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性，为高效测试时自适应提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved
remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their
performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time
adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during
inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive
backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on
likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our
prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for
object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates
adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class
Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both
object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that
adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),
and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We
formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions
are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.
This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood
(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving
class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with
uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic
understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method
requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition
and detection benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出HGCD-BT方法，结合层次聚类与对比学习，显著提升脑肿瘤分类准确率，尤其在识别新类别上表现卓越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅能分类预定义肿瘤类型，无法识别训练中未出现的新类型，而无监督与半监督方法受限于先验知识利用不足或类别假设局限。

Method: 引入Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT)，融合对比学习与新型半监督层次聚类损失函数。

Result: 在OpenSRH数据集上比现有GCD方法提升28%准确率，成功识别未知肿瘤类别，并在Digital Brain Tumor Atlas上验证了跨模态泛化能力。

Conclusion: HGCD-BT有效突破了传统分类方法的类别限制，为术中实时脑肿瘤诊断提供了更具适应性的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision
making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are
restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to
capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised
learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to
incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods
often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data.
Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing
both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the
hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce
Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification
(HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with
contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by
incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate
HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images,
achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for
patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor
categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on
slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images
from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因均匀采样或固定排斥窗口忽略关键帧，或忽视查询相关性，导致长视频理解效果差。

Method: 提出AdaRD-Key，通过Relevance-Diversity Max-Volume目标函数联合优化相关性与多样性，并引入轻量级门控机制在弱对齐时切换为多样性优先模式。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和Video-MME上实现SOTA性能，计算高效、可即插即用，支持实时推理。

Conclusion: AdaRD-Key为长视频理解提供了一种高效、无须训练、查询驱动的关键帧采样新范式。

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for
vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high
information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely
on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to
incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches
impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window
suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at
limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near
important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect
query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module
for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified
Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a
query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to
yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak
alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating
mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method
seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without
additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally
efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing
VLMs in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments on LongVideoBench and
Video-MME demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly on long-form
videos. Code available at https://github.com/Xian867/AdaRD-Key.

Motivation: 现有研究仅关注VLMs在谜语题上的表现，缺乏对其推理过程和失败模式的深入分析。

Method: 构建了221个谜语题的标注数据集，涵盖六类认知类型，提出评估框架分离推理质量与答案正确性，并测试三种提示策略。

Result: 模型在视觉组合上表现良好，但在缺席解释和文化符号上存在根本缺陷；提示策略显著影响其认知路径与解决问题的效果。

Conclusion: 解释性应被视为模型性能的核心组成部分，而不仅是一种事后分析工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their
cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like
rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle
significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and
failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a
comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to
understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our
study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles
across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that
separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three
prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory
processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our
findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle
categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition
while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural
symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences
both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing
explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a
post-hoc consideration.

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as
privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research
has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in
current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In
particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground
truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and
evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To
address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal
benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features
text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and
vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and
challenging text removal scenarios. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 单一检测器在混合医学模态（如X光、CT、MRI）上训练时因统计差异和表示空间分离导致性能下降。

Method: 引入模态令牌（modality tokens）并结合Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA) 和 QueryREPA 预训练，通过自注意力传播模态上下文，用对比损失对齐查询与模态表示。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、通用的多模态医学目标检测解决方案，实现了模态感知且类别保真的查询表示。

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed
medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and
disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to
representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing
features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target
the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,
detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we
define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging
modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate
the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context
Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to
propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style
architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into
object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that
aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific
contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and
QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer
effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained
altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal
overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward
robust multimodality medical object detection. Project page:

Method: 提出Image Head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD)，通过掩码LVLM中的图像注意力头生成对比样本进行对比解码。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7b和Qwen-VL-7b上，于CHAIR、POPE、AMBER和MME等基准测试中显著降低幻觉，同时保留模型通用性能。

Conclusion: MaskCD是一种稳定且高效的幻觉抑制方法，为大视觉语言模型的可靠性提升提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their
capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those
problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for
the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual
and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,
such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive
decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and
attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this
work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach
utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive
samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and
Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The
results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of
hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding

Conclusion: VERNIER为微纳尺度位姿测量提供了一种高效、开放且可定制的相位处理框架，适用于多种显微成像应用。

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist
to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and
microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have
proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable
performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible
using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved
using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an
open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable
pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based
local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust
to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing
are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address
different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with
synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting
the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a
function of the desired performance.

Conclusion: Med-K2N通过序列化自适应融合与因果约束，实现了高质量多模态医学图像生成，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing
missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis.
Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore
K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we
model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target
tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from
noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in
multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing
inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive
workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal
information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with
quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive
weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns
through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative
modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for
adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.
Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal
Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between
generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language
modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple
benchmarks. Source code is available.

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring
food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in
commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble
learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade
and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A
novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,
with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert
assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and
Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply
machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only
external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding
labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from
external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and
weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature
extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,
DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,
SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning
algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the
best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results
demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only
and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble
approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in
freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at

Conclusion: 补丁级语义表示显著提升零样本字幕的可扩展性与灵活性，无需区域标注即可实现精确区域描述。

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space
vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired
image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a
text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global
representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a
unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to
a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without
the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image
representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and
aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to
non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that
enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.
Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual
features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in
multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and
state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on
zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task,
highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for
scalable caption generation. Project page at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/ .

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision
foundation models, including DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced
visual representation learning by providing rich features that generalize well
across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is
established, their capability to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in
semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate
whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmentation datasets can inherently
distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier
supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features
from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside
confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our
method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77
on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised
and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direction for
generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional

Conclusion: HoloV实现高效推理与高准确性的最优权衡，适用于多种MLLM架构与任务

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on
massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate
this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or
[\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this
work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning
approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting
in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we
propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning
framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first
schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By
adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,
HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather
than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational
collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.
Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance
across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA
methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the
original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior
efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CAW方法提升视觉语言模型的零样本对抗鲁棒性，无需牺牲泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等视觉语言模型虽具有强大零样本泛化能力，但对抗攻击下脆弱。

Method: CAW包含两部分：(1) 置信度感知损失，放大清洁与对抗样本预测的KL散度；(2) 特征对齐正则化，最小化冻结与微调图像编码器在对抗输入上的特征距离。

Result: 在TinyImageNet和14个数据集上，CAW在AutoAttack等强攻击下优于PMG-AFT和TGA-ZSR，且内存开销更小。

Conclusion: CAW有效提升零样本鲁棒性，同时保持高clean准确率与泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot
generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot
robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a
Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by
scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a
feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by
minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on
adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and
robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on
TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent
methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while
using less memory.

Motivation: 临床需透明可解释的颈动脉粥样硬化风险评估方法，现有模型在多模态整合与临床解释性上不足。

Method: 提出基于采访式问题序列的评估框架，比较多种开源视觉语言模型（LVLMs），并使用LoRA微调LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna以适配超声域，融合文本化结构化数据。

Result: 原始LVLMs在解剖识别与风险分类上表现差；经LoRA微调后，模型在卒中风险分层上显著提升，性能媲美CNN基线，且多模态数据融合提高特异性和平衡准确率。

Conclusion: LVLMs在超声心血管风险预测中具潜力，但需多模态整合、模型校准与领域适配方可临床转化。

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major
clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging
information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.
This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large
vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by
integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,
laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic
diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,
comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and
medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very
powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,
while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address
this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using
low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke
risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of
text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive
performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines
trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and
limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,
underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and
domain adaptation for clinical translation.

Motivation: 现有深度自编码器方法参数效率低且训练策略不可解释，难以有效分离多期增强MRI中的共享与独立特征。

Method: 设计FDA-VAE模型，将输入与目标图像编码为关于标准正态分布对称的潜在分布，并采用Y型双向训练策略增强特征分离的可解释性。

Result: 相较现有方法，FDA-VAE显著减少参数量和推理时间，同时提升合成质量。

Conclusion: FDA-VAE是一种高效且可解释的多期CE-MRI合成方法，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase
contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep
autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable
training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment
Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model
for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images
into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal
distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The
Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability
of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep
autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces
model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis
quality. The source code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在长.prompt下生成不一致，现有评估指标与人类偏好不符。

Method: 构建LPG-Bench（200个长提示，2600张图）并提出TIT指标，通过图像文本回述一致性评估对齐效果。

Result: TIT-Score-LLM比最优基线提升7.31%的成对准确率，显著优于CLIP-score和LMM-score。

Conclusion: LPG-Bench与TIT为长提示图文生成提供了更可靠评估框架，推动模型发展。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent
text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate
great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively
understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent
generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench
features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250
words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.
Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models
and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,
we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor
consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To
address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on
text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating
long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I
alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the
LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient
score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based
instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to
CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute
improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT
methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the
development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法慢、易失真、依赖人工3D掩码，难以实用

Method: 构建大规模 paired 3D 编辑数据集 3DEditVerse，并提出结构保持的条件 Transformer 模型 3DEditFormer，采用双引导注意力和时间自适应门控

Result: 在定量和定性评估中超越SOTA方法，实现精细、一致、无掩码的3D编辑

Conclusion: 3DEditFormer为可扩展、实用的3D编辑树立了新标准，数据集和代码将公开

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D
asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital
entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging
due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and
fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to
geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are
error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the
data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest
paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training
pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of
pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,
3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic
alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a
3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D
generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer
disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and
consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both
quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and
scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project:

Motivation: 现有Sentinel-2数据集多为无云数据，难以适用于多云的热带地区，且深度网络编码过程中丢失空间与光谱细节。

Method: 设计云注入算法模拟真实云覆盖，提出在解码层注入归一化差值指数（NDIs）保留细节，并融合Sentinel-1雷达数据弥补光学数据缺失。

Result: 在DFC2020数据集上，NDI注入提升无云图像分割性能（U-Net +1.99%，DeepLabV3 +2.78%）；融合Sentinel-1数据在云遮挡场景下显著提升所有模型表现。

Conclusion: 雷达-光学数据融合与NDI注入能有效提升云区地表覆盖分割精度，为多云地区遥感应用提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on
labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are
cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are
common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud
injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test
how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed
optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral
details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we
propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)
into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial
features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land
cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of
1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under
cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant
performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,
highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging
atmospheric scenarios.

Conclusion: PocketSR 实现了高效与高性能的平衡，为边缘设备上的 RealSR 提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality
of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing
methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the
high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment.
In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model
that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high
fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to
the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5%
while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose
online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative
priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective
knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of
prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature
distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we
provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of
146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a
remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on
par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making
it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has surged in response to challenging
questions, especially when a long video must depict multiple sequential events
with temporal coherence and controllable content. Existing methods that extend
to multi-event generation omit an inspection of the intrinsic factor in event
shifting. The paper aims to answer the central question: When and where
multi-event prompts control event transition during T2V generation. This work
introduces MEve, a self-curated prompt suite for evaluating multi-event
text-to-video (T2V) generation, and conducts a systematic study of two
representative model families, i.e., OpenSora and CogVideoX. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the importance of early intervention in denoising steps
and block-wise model layers, revealing the essential factor for multi-event
video generation and highlighting the possibilities for multi-event
conditioning in future models.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is a key task in affective computing,
enabling applications in human-computer interaction, e-learning, healthcare,
and safety systems. Despite advances in deep learning, FER remains challenging
due to occlusions, illumination and pose variations, subtle intra-class
differences, and dataset imbalance that hinders recognition of minority
emotions. We present InsideOut, a reproducible FER framework built on
EfficientNetV2-S with transfer learning, strong data augmentation, and
imbalance-aware optimization. The approach standardizes FER2013 images, applies
stratified splitting and augmentation, and fine-tunes a lightweight
classification head with class-weighted loss to address skewed distributions.
InsideOut achieves 62.8% accuracy with a macro averaged F1 of 0.590 on FER2013,
showing competitive results compared to conventional CNN baselines. The novelty
lies in demonstrating that efficient architectures, combined with tailored
imbalance handling, can provide practical, transparent, and reproducible FER
solutions.

Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in
open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded
on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has
demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and
CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit
of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In
principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such
as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic
features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical
questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware
semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones
contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does
geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no
significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable
higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work
and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for
inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core
components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion
using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose
estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results
suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range
of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric
detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on
effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and
performance of pretrained semantic features.

Conclusion: 训练目标的分布类型和条件信息的构成性是影响组合泛化的关键，连续辅助目标可有效增强离散模型的泛化表现。

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of
known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all
mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence
compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or
negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i)
whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous
distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about
the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show
that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based
objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like
MaskGIT.

Conclusion: Mask2IV无需密集掩码即可实现高质量、可操控的交互视频生成，为机器人学习和具身智能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or
robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they
provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy
training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to
model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that
masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,
obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for
real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel
framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It
adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion
trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on
these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from
users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.
Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users
to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory
through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic
training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and
object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation
scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior
visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few
user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead
to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and
unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,
the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image
poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited
imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images
with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based
perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion
models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying
the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This
trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high
visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and
personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates
unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a
practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We
validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness
against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on
perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$
on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in
safeguarding sensitive data.

Motivation: 现有生成方法仅依赖扩散先验，缺乏几何线索（如相机姿态或深度），导致补全内容错位或不合理，尤其在目标视图与参考图差异大时表现不佳。

Conclusion: GeoComplete通过融合几何感知双分支扩散与目标感知掩码，实现了统一且鲁棒的几何条件图像补全，为无深度信息的多视角修复提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target
view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view
differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely
solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or
depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,
a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce
geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior
image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the
diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,
and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference
cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch
synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other
extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint
self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To
address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the
target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked
during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful
cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a
geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking

TL;DR: 提出HVGC和BridgeDiT框架，实现文本生成同步音视频，显著提升多模态对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本生成音视频方法存在文本条件干扰和跨模态交互机制不明确两大问题。

Method: 提出分层视觉 grounding 的 captions 生成框架（HVGC），并设计双塔扩散变换器 BridgeDiT，引入对称双向跨注意力机制（DCA）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能，人类评估与消融实验验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: HVGC与BridgeDiT有效解决了音视频生成中的模态干扰与同步难题，为T2SV任务提供新范式。

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task,
Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with
synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are
aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical
challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where
the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal
interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism
for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these
challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)
framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and
an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on
HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,
which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust
``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,
achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on
three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive
ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions,
offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints
will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HAVIR模型，通过分层提取结构与语义特征，显著提升从脑活动重建复杂视觉图像的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在重建复杂自然场景时受限于低层特征异质性和高层语义纠缠，需更精细的脑区特征分离机制。

Method: HAVIR模型将视觉皮层分为两个层次区域：Structural Generator提取空间体素的结构信息并转化为扩散先验，Semantic Extractor将语义体素转换为CLIP嵌入，通过Versatile Diffusion融合生成图像。

Result: HAVIR在结构与语义质量上均优于现有模型，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 分层建模脑区特征能有效解耦视觉信息，为脑机接口与视觉重建提供新范式。

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters
interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision.
However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly
complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of
natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level
features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the
hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR
model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and
extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator
extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it
into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic
processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the
Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results
demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of
reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Result: 在Urban Anomalies数据集（亚特兰大和柏林子集）上，基于JSD的评估显示该方法在个体与群体层面均具有高保真度，且数据与计算效率高

Conclusion: Markovian Reeb Graphs是一种可扩展、适用于多样化城市环境的轨迹模拟框架

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning,
epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb
Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that
preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining
individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic
topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that
capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the
Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and
compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable
framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse
urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI辅助脊柱诊断受限于缺乏针对椎体水平、多模态（X光/CT/MRI）且可追踪的临床数据与标准化基准。

Method: 构建SpineMed-450k数据集（45万条指令数据）与SpineBench评估框架，采用临床医生参与的LLM生成流程，涵盖问答、多轮会话与报告生成。

Result: 在SpineBench上，基于SpineMed微调的模型在椎体定位、病理评估和手术规划等任务中显著优于现有LVLMs，临床评估确认其诊断清晰且实用。

Conclusion: SpineMed填补了脊柱AI领域的数据与评估空白，推动AI在临床复杂推理场景中的落地。

Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of
disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of
level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders
requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific
vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of
traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized,
spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem
co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the
first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning
across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and
SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is
curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets,
and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline
with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure
high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations,
and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes,
including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.
Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language
models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained,
level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k
demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks.
Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of
our model's outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成图像日益逼真，带来信息误导和欺诈等社会风险，现有检测方法因领域狭隘、泛化差、缺乏自适应框架而实用性受限。

Method: UniShield结合感知智能体与检测智能体，感知智能体动态选择合适检测模型，检测智能体集成多种专家检测器并生成可解释报告。

Result: UniShield在多个伪造类型上达到state-of-the-art性能，超越现有统一方法和领域特定检测器。

Conclusion: UniShield具有卓越的实用性、自适应性和可扩展性，为图像伪造检测提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become
increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as
misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus
emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal
security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection
methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their
narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an
integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,
the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing
image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document
manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively
integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent
intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection
models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a
unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments
show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing
unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior
practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Result: 在TensoIR和Stanford-ORB数据集上超越SOTA，支持任意环境光照的前馈式重光照

Conclusion: ROGR实现了高效、高精度的可重光照3D建模，适用于真实世界物体捕捉，无需重新优化

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model
of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting
model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment
illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple
lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a
lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's
appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned
NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting
effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF
enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps
without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation.
We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets,
where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our
approach on real-world object captures.

Motivation: 现有基础模型缺乏体积感知或交互能力有限，难以有效支持迭代式用户交互分割。

Method: 采用动态 volumetric prompt 生成与内容感知自适应裁剪，结合 nnInteractive 预训练权重，模拟真实用户交互流程进行高效单GPU训练。

Result: 在竞赛中达到平均Dice分数0.6385、归一化表面距离0.6614，AUC-Dice 2.4799、AUC-NSD 2.5671。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效平衡了交互效率与分割精度，为交互式3D分割提供了实用且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive 3D biomedical image segmentation requires efficient models that
can iteratively refine predictions based on user prompts. Current foundation
models either lack volumetric awareness or suffer from limited interactive
capabilities. We propose a training strategy that combines dynamic volumetric
prompt generation with content-aware adaptive cropping to optimize the use of
the image encoder. Our method simulates realistic user interaction patterns
during training while addressing the computational challenges of learning from
sequential refinement feedback on a single GPU. For efficient training, we
initialize our network using the publicly available weights from the
nnInteractive segmentation model. Evaluation on the \textbf{Foundation Models
for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation} competition demonstrates
strong performance with an average final Dice score of 0.6385, normalized
surface distance of 0.6614, and area-under-the-curve metrics of 2.4799 (Dice)

TL;DR: PQGAN通过将产品量化（PQ）引入VQGAN框架，显著提升了图像重建质量，并在扩散模型中实现高效生成或分辨率翻倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 产品量化（PQ）在高保真图像生成中的潜表示应用受限，现有方法在重建性能上不足。

Method: 提出PQGAN，将PQ整合进VQ框架，系统分析码本大小、嵌入维度与子空间分解的关系，并优化超参数选择。

Result: PSNR达37dB（前人27dB），FID、LPIPS、CMMD降低达96%，可无缝集成至扩散模型，实现高效生成或分辨率翻倍。

Conclusion: PQ是高保真图像合成中离散潜表示的强大扩展，其性能趋势为超参数设计提供新指导。

Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding,
yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image
generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder
that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of
VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in
terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and
their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior
work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up
to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between
codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with
vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such
that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the
embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ
that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that
PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This
enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or
a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a
strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归视频扩散模型在有限计算资源下，难以兼顾新场景生成质量与已探索区域的空间一致性，时空记忆存在权衡问题。

Method: 引入Memory Forcing框架，包含混合训练（Hybrid Training）、链式前向训练（Chained Forward Training）、点到帧检索（Point-to-Frame Retrieval）和增量3D重建（Incremental 3D Reconstruction）。

Result: 在多样化环境中显著提升长期空间一致性与生成质量，且保持计算高效，适用于长序列视频生成。

Conclusion: Memory Forcing有效平衡时空记忆的trade-off，为交互式场景生成提供了可行的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world
modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a
representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate
natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency
when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must
compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which
exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,
whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene
generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.
We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols
with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct
gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during
exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward
Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained
predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial
memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently
retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames,
while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior
long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse
environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended
sequences.

Conclusion: MonSTeR为动作-场景-意图对齐提供了新范式，具备强大泛化能力与实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement
can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive
nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to
evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text),
and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the
first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of
higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging
unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the
intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust
retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms
trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we
validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a
dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space
on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and
pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、通用的测试时防御方法，利用随机共振对抗对抗攻击，在图像分类和密集预测任务中显著恢复模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过特征过滤或平滑对抗攻击，可能导致信息损失，亟需一种不损失信息且通用的测试时防御机制。

Method: 引入微小平移扰动，对变换后的特征嵌入对齐并聚合，再映射回原图，采用闭式公式实现，无需修改网络结构或微调。

Result: 在图像分类中恢复68.1%的精度损失，在立体匹配中恢复71.9%，在光流中恢复29.2%，首次实现密集预测任务的通用测试时防御。

Conclusion: 该方法训练无依赖、架构无关、攻击无关，具备高通用性与实用性，为对抗防御提供新范式。

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:
imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a
model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,
which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by
leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing
information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to
the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them
before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a
closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network
architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for
specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,
architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show
state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,
establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including
stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and
practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our
method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%
on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of
adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently
achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining
the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.
However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving
cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to
the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a
novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its
core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a
dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel
relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for
building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the
interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture
benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code

Motivation: 现有VLM通过文本token直接生成像素坐标，难以泛化到训练中未见的高分辨率界面，导致定位失败

Method: 引入RULER作为显式坐标标记符，并采用Interleaved MRoPE对宽高维度进行对称位置编码

Result: 在ScreenSpot系列数据集上显著提升接地准确率，尤其在高分辨率界面表现最优

Conclusion: 显式空间引导优于隐式学习，可实现跨分辨率与平台的更可靠GUI自动化

Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel
coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for
current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which
breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training.
Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual
features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings
implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new
resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER
tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference
positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate
coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial
encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,
addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on
ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in
grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution
interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on
implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across
diverse resolutions and platforms.

Result: 在肠胃镜和体育VQA任务上，LEAML在极少标注下均优于标准微调方法。

Conclusion: LEAML通过伪标签生成与选择性参数更新，有效提升了多模态模型在低标注专业领域的适应能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in
specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and
expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that
leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our
approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled
data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we
selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,
enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge
during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA
demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under
minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML

Conclusion: ERUPT通过XR提升了机器人路径规划的直观性、交互性与实用性，为工业与服务机器人提供高效人机协作方案。

Abstract: We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an
extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows
users to create and dy- namically reconfigure environments while they plan
robot paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a
greater spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural
interaction capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the
environment similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard
with the scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system
integrates with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to
send motion planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in
virtual or augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction
modalities, allowing users to modify objects in the environment and interact
with a virtual robot. Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions,
ensuring desired behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶场景生成框架因编辑能力有限，难以高效生成逼真场景。

Method: 采用语言对齐的高斯点云重建场景，结合多智能体运动预测，实现自然语言控制的对象添加、轨迹修改与交互预测。

Result: 在 Waymo 数据集上验证了 SIMSplat 在多样场景中具备强大的编辑能力与适应性。

Conclusion: SIMSplat 为驾驶场景编辑提供了高效、直观且精确的语言驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising
alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing
frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited
editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a
predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a
language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using
natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed
scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise
and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing,
including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles
and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through
multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all
agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's
extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of
scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

TL;DR: 提出U-LAG框架和UAR-PF方法，通过感知延迟下的不确定性感知目标重定向，提升机器人在动态环境中的操作成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在变化环境中面临感知延迟、噪声和陈旧信息的问题，传统方法难以有效应对。

Method: U-LAG引入中间执行层，结合UAR-PF算法，在感知延迟下维护物体位姿分布并选择最大化期望进展的目标。

Result: 在PyBullet/PandaGym的Shift x Lag基准上，UAR-PF在0-10cm位移和0-400ms延迟下，相比无重定向基线，成功率达更高，执行路径更短，中止更少。

Conclusion: U-LAG和UAR-PF为感知延迟下的机器人控制提供可插拔、高效且稳定的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Robots manipulating in changing environments must act on percepts that are
late, noisy, or stale. We present U-LAG, a mid-execution goal-retargeting layer
that leaves the low-level controller unchanged while re-aiming task goals
(pre-contact, contact, post) as new observations arrive. Unlike motion
retargeting or generic visual servoing, U-LAG treats in-flight goal re-aiming
as a first-class, pluggable module between perception and control. Our main
technical contribution is UAR-PF, an uncertainty-aware retargeter that
maintains a distribution over object pose under sensing lag and selects goals
that maximize expected progress. We instantiate a reproducible Shift x Lag
stress test in PyBullet/PandaGym for pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion,
where the object undergoes abrupt in-plane shifts while synthetic perception
lag is injected during approach. Across 0-10 cm shifts and 0-400 ms lags,
UAR-PF and ICP degrade gracefully relative to a no-retarget baseline, achieving
higher success with modest end-effector travel and fewer aborts; simple
operational safeguards further improve stability. Contributions: (1) UAR-PF for
lag-adaptive, uncertainty-aware goal retargeting; (2) a pluggable retargeting
interface; and (3) a reproducible Shift x Lag benchmark with evaluation on
pick, push, stacking, and peg insertion.

Abstract: We are interested in solving the problem of imitation learning with a limited

struggle with poor data coverage and severe performance degradation. We propose
a solution that leverages robot simulators to achieve online imitation

online imitation pretraining with offline finetuning. By leveraging online

methods, leading to improved robustness and reduced performance degradation
during finetuning. It also enhances generalization during domain transfer. Our
empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness, improving success rates by at
least 31.7% in sim-to-sim transfer and 23.3% in sim-to-real transfer over
existing offline imitation learning baselines.

Motivation: 传统Koopman方法仅线性化动力学，无法处理碰撞约束等非线性条件，导致路径规划效率低

Method: 使用扩展动态模态分解从输入-状态数据中识别线性与双线性Koopman模型，并在提升空间中构建二次规划的MPC控制器

Result: 双线性Koopman模型能精确捕捉非线性耦合与二次项，实现比非线性MPC快320倍的计算速度，同时保证碰撞避免

Conclusion: 双线性Koopman逼近为高非线性最优控制问题提供了高效线性化新范式，兼具精度与实时性

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for
mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator
theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the
linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global
linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both
the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy
extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman
realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that
only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input
couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear
realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path
planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine
the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of
finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC
counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space.
Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for
linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear
state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to
linear problems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of haptic feedback and virtual
reality (VR) control interfaces to enhance teleoperation and telemanipulation
of underwater ROVs (remotely operated vehicles). Traditional ROV teleoperation
relies on low-resolution 2D camera feeds and lacks immersive and sensory
feedback, which diminishes situational awareness in complex subsea
environments. We propose SubSense -- a novel VR-Haptic framework incorporating
a non-invasive feedback interface to an otherwise 1-DOF (degree of freedom)
manipulator, which is paired with the teleoperator's glove to provide haptic
feedback and grasp status. Additionally, our framework integrates end-to-end
software for managing control inputs and displaying immersive camera views
through a VR platform. We validate the system through comprehensive experiments
and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness over conventional
teleoperation interfaces, particularly for delicate manipulation tasks. Our
results highlight the potential of multisensory feedback in immersive virtual
environments to significantly improve remote situational awareness and mission
performance, offering more intuitive and accessible ROV operations in the
field.

Motivation: 通用操控策略在从人类演示（如手持抓取器）迁移到受限机器人载体时，因控制与动力学差异导致表现差，亟需能自适应不同载体的部署方法。

Method: 提出Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP)，在推理时耦合高层UMI策略与低层载体特定控制器，通过控制器跟踪代价的梯度反馈引导扩散采样，生成符合载体动力学的轨迹。

Result: 在多个高空精密操作任务中，EADP相比无引导扩散基线显著提升成功率、效率与抗扰性，并成功泛化至未见过的环境与野外采集的演示数据。

Conclusion: EADP提供了一种可扩展的路径，使通用操控策略能高效适配多样甚至高度受限的机器人载体，推动真实场景下的规模化部署。

Abstract: We introduce UMI-on-Air, a framework for embodiment-aware deployment of
embodiment-agnostic manipulation policies. Our approach leverages diverse,
unconstrained human demonstrations collected with a handheld gripper (UMI) to
train generalizable visuomotor policies. A central challenge in transferring
these policies to constrained robotic embodiments-such as aerial
manipulators-is the mismatch in control and robot dynamics, which often leads
to out-of-distribution behaviors and poor execution. To address this, we
propose Embodiment-Aware Diffusion Policy (EADP), which couples a high-level
UMI policy with a low-level embodiment-specific controller at inference time.
By integrating gradient feedback from the controller's tracking cost into the
diffusion sampling process, our method steers trajectory generation towards
dynamically feasible modes tailored to the deployment embodiment. This enables
plug-and-play, embodiment-aware trajectory adaptation at test time. We validate
our approach on multiple long-horizon and high-precision aerial manipulation
tasks, showing improved success rates, efficiency, and robustness under
disturbances compared to unguided diffusion baselines. Finally, we demonstrate
deployment in previously unseen environments, using UMI demonstrations
collected in the wild, highlighting a practical pathway for scaling
generalizable manipulation skills across diverse-and even highly
constrained-embodiments. All code, data, and checkpoints will be publicly
released after acceptance. Result videos can be found at umi-on-air.github.io.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升动态环境下的SLAM性能，实现高精度与近实时平衡，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays an important role in many
robotics fields, including social robots. Many of the available visual SLAM
methods are based on the assumption of a static world and struggle in dynamic
environments. In the current study, we introduce a real-time semantic RGBD SLAM
approach designed specifically for dynamic environments. Our proposed system
can effectively detect moving objects and maintain a static map to ensure
robust camera tracking. The key innovation of our approach is the incorporation
of deep learning-based semantic information into SLAM systems to mitigate the
impact of dynamic objects. Additionally, we enhance the semantic segmentation
process by integrating an Extended Kalman filter to identify dynamic objects
that may be temporarily idle. We have also implemented a generative network to
fill in the missing regions of input images belonging to dynamic objects. This
highly modular framework has been implemented on the ROS platform and can
achieve around 22 fps on a GTX1080. Benchmarking the developed pipeline on
dynamic sequences from the TUM dataset suggests that the proposed approach
delivers competitive localization error in comparison with the state-of-the-art
methods, all while operating in near real-time. The source code is publicly
available.

Abstract: This paper proposes an algorithm capable of driving a system to follow a

Motivated by a critical failure scenario in which a system can experience an
abrupt change in its dynamics, we demonstrate that it is possible to follow a
set of waypoints comprised of states analytically proven to be reachable
despite not knowing the system dynamics. The proposed algorithm first applies
small perturbations to locally learn the system dynamics around the current
state, then computes the set of states that are provably reachable using the
locally learned dynamics and their corresponding maximum growth-rate bounds,
and finally synthesizes a control action that navigates the system to a
guaranteed reachable state.

Abstract: Rigid-formation navigation of multiple robots is essential for applications
such as cooperative transportation. This process involves a team of
collaborative robots maintaining a predefined geometric configuration, such as
a square, while in motion. For untethered collaborative motion, inter-robot
communication must be conducted through a wireless network. Notably, few
existing works offer a comprehensive solution for multi-robot formation
navigation executable on microprocessor platforms via wireless networks,
particularly for formations that must traverse complex curvilinear paths. To
address this gap, we introduce a novel "hold-and-hit" communication-control
framework designed to work seamlessly with the widely-used Robotic Operating
System (ROS) platform. The hold-and-hit framework synchronizes robot movements
in a manner robust against wireless network delays and packet loss. It operates
over discrete-time communication-control cycles, making it suitable for
implementation on contemporary microprocessors. Complementary to hold-and-hit,
we propose an intra-cycle optimization approach that enables rigid formations
to closely follow desired curvilinear paths, even under the nonholonomic
movement constraints inherent to most vehicular robots. The combination of
hold-and-hit and intra-cycle optimization ensures precise and reliable
navigation even in challenging scenarios. Simulations in a virtual environment
demonstrate the superiority of our method in maintaining a four-robot square
formation along an S-shaped path, outperforming two existing approaches.
Furthermore, real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of our
framework: the robots maintained an inter-distance error within $\pm 0.069m$
and an inter-angular orientation error within $\pm19.15^{\circ}$ while
navigating along an S-shaped path at a fixed linear velocity of $0.1 m/s$.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决数据偏差问题，为自动驾驶轨迹预测提供高质量合成数据，增强模型在复杂场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it
underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments.
However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail
distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and
simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density
scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and
turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic
evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory
generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and
enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous
road environments into a structured grid representation that supports
fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent
coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware
generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with
Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This
design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare
behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and
behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety.
Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and
enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.

Conclusion: iLLM-A*有效突破LLM-A*的效率瓶颈，为大规模路径规划提供高效、低内存的新范式。

Abstract: Path planning in grid maps, arising from various applications, has garnered
significant attention. Existing methods, such as A*, Dijkstra, and their
variants, work well for small-scale maps but fail to address large-scale ones
due to high search time and memory consumption. Recently, Large Language Models
(LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in path planning but still suffer from
spatial illusion and poor planning performance. Among all the works, LLM-A*
\cite{meng2024llm} leverages LLM to generate a series of waypoints and then
uses A* to plan the paths between the neighboring waypoints. In this way, the
complete path is constructed. However, LLM-A* still suffers from high
computational time for large-scale maps. To fill this gap, we conducted a deep
investigation into LLM-A* and found its bottleneck, resulting in limited
performance. Accordingly, we design an innovative LLM-enhanced algorithm, abbr.
as iLLM-A*. iLLM-A* includes 3 carefully designed mechanisms, including the
optimization of A*, an incremental learning method for LLM to generate
high-quality waypoints, and the selection of the appropriate waypoints for A*
for path planning. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation on various grid maps
shows that, compared with LLM-A*, iLLM-A* \textbf{1) achieves more than
$1000\times$ speedup on average, and up to $2349.5\times$ speedup in the
extreme case, 2) saves up to $58.6\%$ of the memory cost, 3) achieves both
obviously shorter path length and lower path length standard deviation.}

Abstract: Cross-modal drone navigation remains a challenging task in robotics,
requiring efficient retrieval of relevant images from large-scale databases
based on natural language descriptions. The RoboSense 2025 Track 4 challenge
addresses this challenge, focusing on robust, natural language-guided
cross-view image retrieval across multiple platforms (drones, satellites, and
ground cameras). Current baseline methods, while effective for initial
retrieval, often struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic matching between
text queries and visual content, especially in complex aerial scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose a two-stage retrieval refinement method:
Caption-Guided Retrieval System (CGRS) that enhances the baseline coarse
ranking through intelligent reranking. Our method first leverages a baseline
model to obtain an initial coarse ranking of the top 20 most relevant images
for each query. We then use Vision-Language-Model (VLM) to generate detailed
captions for these candidate images, capturing rich semantic descriptions of
their visual content. These generated captions are then used in a multimodal
similarity computation framework to perform fine-grained reranking of the
original text query, effectively building a semantic bridge between the visual
content and natural language descriptions. Our approach significantly improves
upon the baseline, achieving a consistent 5\% improvement across all key
metrics (Recall@1, Recall@5, and Recall@10). Our approach win TOP-2 in the
challenge, demonstrating the practical value of our semantic refinement
strategy in real-world robotic navigation scenarios.

Abstract: While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich
tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require
continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,
most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of
physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact
forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information
into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,
but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data
scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing
processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the
Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating
force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human
demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the
performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our
approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a
bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact
maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions. Project Website:

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning
capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several
automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging
environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work
zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and
dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this
gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone
trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct
trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first
identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and
then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human
verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory
planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases
into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG
retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.
Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a
reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM
baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统开环FES控制器固定刺激强度易导致过度或不足刺激，引起肌肉疲劳或跌倒风险。

Method: 设计闭环FES系统，依据实时足趾清地动态调整刺激强度，并在健康受试者中模拟足下垂，对比开环与闭环在不同步行条件下的表现。

Result: 闭环系统在维持足趾清地的同时，显著降低刺激强度，且不影响髋、膝、踝关节角度。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持疗效的同时，有望减轻肌肉疲劳，提升长期使用舒适性与依从性。

Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES),
typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation
intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external
controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and
discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases
fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that
dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance,
providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop
in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller
with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions,
including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that
our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without
significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the
ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to
the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not
only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the
potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and
adherence.

Method: 提出动作偏差感知混合推理，利用动作偏差预测验证需求，动态跳过无需服务器校正的步骤，并推导出最优偏差阈值。

Conclusion: 动作偏差可有效作为校验跳过依据，在保证性能前提下显著提升分布式AI系统的效率，为6G边缘推理提供新范式。

Abstract: To support latency-sensitive AI applications ranging from autonomous driving
to industrial robot manipulation, 6G envisions distributed ML, connecting
distributed computational resources in edge and cloud over hyper-reliable
low-latency communication (HRLLC). In this setting, speculative decoding can
facilitate collaborative inference of models distributively deployed: an
on-device draft model locally generates drafts and a remote server-based target
model verifies and corrects them, resulting lower latency. However, unlike
autoregressive text generation, behavior cloning policies, typically used for
embodied AI applications like robot manipulation and autonomous driving, cannot
parallelize verification and correction for multiple drafts as each action
depends on observation which needs to be updated by a previous action. To this
end, we propose Action Deviation-Aware Hybrid Inference, wherein the draft
model estimates an action's need for verification and correction by the target
model and selectively skips communication and computation for server
operations. Action deviation shows a strong correlation with action's rejection
probability by the target model, enabling selective skipping. We derive the
path deviation threshold that balances the transmission rate and the inference
performance, and we empirically show that action deviation-aware hybrid
inference reduces uplink transmission and server operation by 40%, while
lowering end-to-end latency by 33.32% relative to hybrid inference without
skipping and achieving task success rate up to 97.03% of that of target model
only inference.

Conclusion: UWB SAR成像技术可行且有效，可显著提升机器人在恶劣环境下的感知鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Traditional exteroceptive sensors in mobile robots, such as LiDARs and
cameras often struggle to perceive the environment in poor visibility
conditions. Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have
emerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse
environmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small
apertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed
image of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large
aperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The
resulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition
representation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a
pipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an
unknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature
detectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB
SAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental
conditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR
imaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection
toward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems.

Conclusion: 该算法有效提升自主机器人在动态复杂环境中的安全导航能力，代码已开源以促进社区发展。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm to facilitate
safety-critical navigation for autonomous mobile robots. The proposed algorithm
integrates a real-time dynamic obstacle tracking and mapping system that
categorizes point clouds into dynamic and static components. For dynamic point
clouds, the Kalman filter is employed to estimate and predict their motion
states. Based on these predictions, we extrapolate the future states of dynamic
point clouds, which are subsequently merged with static point clouds to
construct the forward-time-domain (FTD) map. By combining control barrier
functions (CBFs) with nonlinear model predictive control, the proposed
algorithm enables the robot to effectively avoid both static and dynamic
obstacles. The CBF constraints are formulated based on risk points identified
through collision detection between the predicted future states and the FTD
map. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world scenarios
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in complex environments. In
simulation experiments, the proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline
approaches, showing superior performance in terms of safety and robustness in
obstacle avoidance. The source code is released for the reference of the
robotics community.

Result: 当前数值指标部分反映导航行为，但关键主观因素缺失，未与人类感知充分对齐。

Conclusion: 需设计新型量化指标以更准确表征人类对机器人社会导航的主观体验。

Abstract: Social, also called human-aware, navigation is a key challenge for the
integration of mobile robots into human environments. The evaluation of such
systems is complex, as factors such as comfort, safety, and legibility must be
considered. Human-centered assessments, typically conducted through surveys,
provide reliable insights but are costly, resource-intensive, and difficult to
reproduce or compare across systems. Alternatively, numerical social navigation
metrics are easy to compute and facilitate comparisons, yet the community lacks
consensus on a standard set of metrics.
  This work explores the relationship between numerical metrics and
human-centered evaluations to identify potential correlations. If specific
quantitative measures align with human perceptions, they could serve as
standardized evaluation tools, reducing the dependency on surveys. Our results
indicate that while current metrics capture some aspects of robot navigation
behavior, important subjective factors remain insufficiently represented and
new metrics are necessary.

Conclusion: 所提连续控制策略在低功耗系统中可行，为简化摆动机器人提供了实用且高效的控制方案。

Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is
presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms
attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal
bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the
robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based
on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for
repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing
the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is
proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide
mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy
accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two
strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control
strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system,
and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are
experimentally validated.

Abstract: Achieving precise lateral motion modeling and decoupled control in hover
remains a significant challenge for tail-sitter Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs), primarily due to complex aerodynamic couplings and the absence of
welldefined lateral dynamics. This paper presents a novel modeling and control
strategy that enhances yaw authority and lateral motion by introducing a
sideslip force model derived from differential propeller slipstream effects
acting on the fuselage under differential thrust. The resulting lateral force
along the body y-axis enables yaw-based lateral position control without
inducing roll coupling. The control framework employs a YXZ Euler rotation
formulation to accurately represent attitude and incorporate gravitational
components while directly controlling yaw in the yaxis, thereby improving
lateral dynamic behavior and avoiding singularities. The proposed approach is
validated through trajectory-tracking simulations conducted in a Unity-based
environment. Tests on both rectangular and circular paths in hover mode
demonstrate stable performance, with low mean absolute position errors and yaw
deviations constrained within 5.688 degrees. These results confirm the
effectiveness of the proposed lateral force generation model and provide a
foundation for the development of agile, hover-capable tail-sitter UAVs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for estimating the position and

inertial measurement units (IMUs), optimized and calibrated with ground truth

angles estimated from accelerometer and gyroscope measurements acquired by
cost-effective IMUs. A complementary filter is employed to fuse the
measurements, with its parameters optimized through particle swarm optimization
(PSO) to mitigate noise and delay. To further improve estimation accuracy,
residual errors in position and orientation are compensated using radial basis
function neural networks (RBFNN). Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed intelligent multi-IMU kinematic estimation
method, achieving root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.00021~m, 0.00041~m, and

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for real-time optimal controlling of a
heavy-duty skid-steered mobile platform for trajectory tracking. The importance
of accurate real-time performance of the controller lies in safety
considerations of situations where the dynamic system under control is affected
by uncertainties and disturbances, and the controller should compensate for
such phenomena in order to provide stable performance. A multiple-shooting
nonlinear model-predictive control framework is proposed in this paper. This
framework benefits from suitable algorithm along with readings from various
sensors for genuine real-time performance with extremely high accuracy. The
controller is then tested for tracking different trajectories where it
demonstrates highly desirable performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
This controller shows remarkable improvement when compared to existing
nonlinear model-predictive controllers in the literature that were implemented
on skid-steered mobile platforms.

Abstract: Diffusion models, as a class of deep generative models, have recently emerged
as powerful tools for robot skills by enabling stable training with reliable
convergence. In this paper, we present an end-to-end framework for generating
long, smooth trajectories that explicitly target high surface coverage across
various industrial tasks, including polishing, robotic painting, and spray
coating. The conventional methods are always fundamentally constrained by their
predefined functional forms, which limit the shapes of the trajectories they
can represent and make it difficult to handle complex and diverse tasks.
Moreover, their generalization is poor, often requiring manual redesign or
extensive parameter tuning when applied to new scenarios. These limitations
highlight the need for more expressive generative models, making
diffusion-based approaches a compelling choice for trajectory generation. By
iteratively denoising trajectories with carefully learned noise schedules and
conditioning mechanisms, diffusion models not only ensure smooth and consistent
motion but also flexibly adapt to the task context. In experiments, our method
improves trajectory continuity, maintains high coverage, and generalizes to
unseen shapes, paving the way for unified end-to-end trajectory learning across
industrial surface-processing tasks without category-specific models. On
average, our approach improves Point-wise Chamfer Distance by 98.2\% and
smoothness by 97.0\%, while increasing surface coverage by 61\% compared to
prior methods. The link to our code can be found

Abstract: A significant bottleneck in humanoid policy learning is the acquisition of
large-scale, diverse datasets, as collecting reliable real-world data remains
both difficult and cost-prohibitive. To address this limitation, we introduce
HumanoidExo, a novel system that transfers human motion to whole-body humanoid
data. HumanoidExo offers a high-efficiency solution that minimizes the
embodiment gap between the human demonstrator and the robot, thereby tackling
the scarcity of whole-body humanoid data. By facilitating the collection of
more voluminous and diverse datasets, our approach significantly enhances the
performance of humanoid robots in dynamic, real-world scenarios. We evaluated
our method across three challenging real-world tasks: table-top manipulation,
manipulation integrated with stand-squat motions, and whole-body manipulation.
Our results empirically demonstrate that HumanoidExo is a crucial addition to
real-robot data, as it enables the humanoid policy to generalize to novel
environments, learn complex whole-body control from only five real-robot
demonstrations, and even acquire new skills (i.e., walking) solely from
HumanoidExo data.

Abstract: Long-term human motion prediction (LHMP) is important for the safe and
efficient operation of autonomous robots and vehicles in environments shared
with humans. Accurate predictions are important for applications including
motion planning, tracking, human-robot interaction, and safety monitoring. In
this paper, we exploit Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), which encode spatial or

horizons of up to 60 seconds. We propose an MoD-informed LHMP framework that
supports various types of MoDs and includes a ranking method to output the most
likely predicted trajectory, improving practical utility in robotics. Further,
a time-conditioned MoD is introduced to capture motion patterns that vary
across different times of day. We evaluate MoD-LHMP instantiated with three
types of MoDs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that MoD-informed
method outperforms learning-based ones, with up to 50\% improvement in average

Abstract: Humanoid robots, as general-purpose physical agents, must integrate both
intelligent control and adaptive morphology to operate effectively in diverse
real-world environments. While recent research has focused primarily on
optimizing control policies for fixed robot structures, this position paper
argues for evolving both control strategies and humanoid robots' physical
structure under a co-design mechanism. Inspired by biological evolution, this
approach enables robots to iteratively adapt both their form and behavior to
optimize performance within task-specific and resource-constrained contexts.
Despite its promise, co-design in humanoid robotics remains a relatively
underexplored domain, raising fundamental questions about its feasibility and
necessity in achieving true embodied intelligence. To address these challenges,
we propose practical co-design methodologies grounded in strategic exploration,
Sim2Real transfer, and meta-policy learning. We further argue for the essential
role of co-design by analyzing it from methodological, application-driven, and
community-oriented perspectives. Striving to guide and inspire future studies,
we present open research questions, spanning from short-term innovations to
long-term goals. This work positions co-design as a cornerstone for developing
the next generation of intelligent and adaptable humanoid agents.

Abstract: Tiny flying robots hold great potential for search-and-rescue, safety
inspections, and environmental monitoring, but their small size limits
conventional sensing-especially with poor-lighting, smoke, dust or reflective
obstacles. Inspired by nature, we propose a lightweight, 3.2-gram,
whisker-based tactile sensing apparatus for tiny drones, enabling them to
navigate and explore through gentle physical interaction. Just as rats and
moles use whiskers to perceive surroundings, our system equips drones with
tactile perception in flight, allowing obstacle sensing even in pitch-dark
conditions. The apparatus uses barometer-based whisker sensors to detect
obstacle locations while minimising destabilisation. To address sensor noise
and drift, we develop a tactile depth estimation method achieving sub-6 mm
accuracy. This enables drones to navigate, contour obstacles, and explore
confined spaces solely through touch-even in total darkness along both soft and
rigid surfaces. Running fully onboard a 192-KB RAM microcontroller, the system
supports autonomous tactile flight and is validated in both simulation and
real-world tests. Our bio-inspired approach redefines vision-free navigation,
opening new possibilities for micro aerial vehicles in extreme environments.

Abstract: Stability certificates play a critical role in ensuring the safety and
reliability of robotic systems. However, deriving these certificates for
complex, unknown systems has traditionally required explicit knowledge of
system dynamics, often making it a daunting task. This work introduces a novel
framework that learns a Lyapunov function directly from trajectory data,
enabling the certification of stability for autonomous systems without needing
detailed system models. By parameterizing the Lyapunov candidate using a neural
network and ensuring positive definiteness through Cholesky factorization, our
approach automatically identifies whether the system is stable under the given
trajectory. To address the challenges posed by noisy, real-world data, we allow
for controlled violations of the stability condition, focusing on maintaining
high confidence in the stability certification process. Our results demonstrate
that this framework can provide data-driven stability guarantees, offering a
robust method for certifying the safety of robotic systems in dynamic,
real-world environments. This approach works without access to the internal
control algorithms, making it applicable even in situations where system
behavior is opaque or proprietary. The tool for learning the stability proof is
open-sourced by this research: https://github.com/HansOersted/stability.

Motivation: 视觉观测的光学信息难以如LiDAR或深度图那样显式建模，需智能模型与大规模数据支持。

Method: 构建MM-Nav模型，基于预训练大语言模型与视觉基础模型，使用三种RL专家在定制环境中生成的合成数据进行师生迭代训练，并动态平衡多能力训练比例。

Result: 在合成和真实环境中均表现出强泛化能力，学生模型性能超越RL教师模型，体现多能力集成的协同效应。

Conclusion: VLA模型能有效利用合成专家数据学习复杂导航能力，实现无需深度信息的视觉导航，具有实用潜力。

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it
mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,
optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly
modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires
intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage
the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse
navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.
Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360
observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation
models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three
reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information
in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation
capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA
model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is
dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through
extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model
achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student
VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of
integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further
confirm the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机在复杂环境中高效、平滑覆盖电力巡检点的轨迹规划问题

Method: 前端使用遗传算法求解POI的TSP问题生成访问序列，后端通过非线性最小二乘优化轨迹平滑性、时间和避障约束

Result: 数值仿真验证算法能有效生成满足约束的平滑覆盖轨迹

Conclusion: 该算法可实现无人机在复杂环境中的平滑、高效全覆盖

Abstract: For typical applications of UAVs in power grid scenarios, we construct the
problem as planning UAV trajectories for coverage in cluttered environments. In
this paper, we propose an optimal smooth coverage trajectory planning
algorithm. The algorithm consists of two stages. In the front-end, a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for
Points of Interest (POIs), generating an initial sequence of optimized visiting
points. In the back-end, the sequence is further optimized by considering
trajectory smoothness, time consumption, and obstacle avoidance. This is
formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and solved to produce a smooth
coverage trajectory that satisfies these constraints. Numerical simulations
validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, ensuring UAVs can
smoothly cover all POIs in cluttered environments.

TL;DR: VLMFP提出双VLM框架，自动生成PDDL领域与问题文件，提升视觉规划的长程与空间推理能力，无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工预定义PDDL领域文件或频繁环境交互，因VLM难以准确生成PDDL领域规则而受限。

Method: VLMFP引入SimVLM模拟动作后果，GenVLM通过对比执行结果迭代优化PDDL文件，实现双VLM协同生成。

Result: SimVLM在已知/未知外观下准确描述95.5%/82.6%场景，模拟85.5%/87.8%动作序列；VLMFP生成有效规划达70.0%/54.1%。

Conclusion: VLMFP实现PDDL文件的全自动生成，显著提升泛化能力，支持跨实例、外观与规则的视觉规划。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but
struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning
Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal
planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these
complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into
PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem
files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain
files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely
on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access
for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can
autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual
planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A
SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and
a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the
PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of
generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the
different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different
problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world
domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game
rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios,
simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal
reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of
SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for
unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively. Project page:

*Junru Hua,Rahul Ahluwalia,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于GAN和SMOTE的数据增强框架，用于极端值预测，结果表明SMOTE策略在长短时预测中表现最优，Conv-LSTM适合周期性数据，BD-LSTM适合非平稳序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端值预测在金融、气候等领域具有挑战性，传统方法在样本不均衡条件下性能受限，需引入数据增强技术提升模型对极端事件的预测能力。

Method: 结合Conv-LSTM和BD-LSTM深度模型，采用GAN和SMOTE进行数据增强，并设计基于相关性函数的增强策略，评估不同方法在精度与计算效率上的表现。

Result: SMOTE在整体与极端区域预测中表现最稳定，优于GAN；Conv-LSTM擅长周期性数据，BD-LSTM更适用于混沌或非平稳序列。

Conclusion: SMOTE是极端值预测中更有效的数据增强方法，模型选择应依据数据特性：周期性选Conv-LSTM，非平稳性选BD-LSTM。

Abstract: Data augmentation with generative adversarial networks (GANs) has been
popular for class imbalance problems, mainly for pattern classification and
computer vision-related applications. Extreme value forecasting is a
challenging field that has various applications from finance to climate change
problems. In this study, we present a data augmentation framework for extreme
value forecasting. In this framework, our focus is on forecasting extreme
values using deep learning models in combination with data augmentation models
such as GANs and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). We use deep
learning models such as convolutional long short-term memory (Conv-LSTM) and
bidirectional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) networks for multistep ahead
prediction featuring extremes. We investigate which data augmentation models
are the most suitable, taking into account the prediction accuracy overall and
at extreme regions, along with computational efficiency. We also present novel
strategies for incorporating data augmentation, considering extreme values
based on a relevance function. Our results indicate that the SMOTE-based
strategy consistently demonstrated superior adaptability, leading to improved
performance across both short- and long-horizon forecasts. Conv-LSTM and
BD-LSTM exhibit complementary strengths: the former excels in periodic, stable
datasets, while the latter performs better in chaotic or non-stationary
sequences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM无法有效处理时间序列数据，限制其在医疗等领域的应用，亟需一种能原生理解时间序列的模型。

Method: 设计两种架构：OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt（软提示隐式建模）和OpenTSLM-Flamingo（交叉注意力显式建模），并在三个新构建的CoT数据集（HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, ECG-QA-CoT）上进行评估。

Result: OpenTSLM在睡眠分期达69.9 F1、HAR达65.4 F1，远超文本-only模型（9.05/52.2）和GPT-4o（15.47/2.95）；Flamingo在长序列上表现更优且内存稳定，SoftPrompt内存随长度指数增长。

Conclusion: OpenTSLM成功实现时间序列与语言的原生融合，推动医疗AI推理能力提升，开源所有资源以促进后续研究。

Abstract: LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In
medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of
clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications.
Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To
overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models
(TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained
LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We
investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,
models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens
with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we
hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms
implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time
series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against
baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of
text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three
datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models
outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR,
compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even
1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo
matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences,
while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows
exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared
to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by
clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA.
To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models
open-source.

TL;DR: RainSeer通过将雷达反射率作为物理结构先验，提升了高分辨率降雨场重建的精度，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间插值方法过于平滑，无法捕捉降雨的尖锐过渡和局部极端值，影响洪水预报和水文建模。

Method: 提出RainSeer框架，采用物理知情的两阶段架构：结构到点映射器实现雷达结构与地面观测的双向对齐，地理感知降雨解码器通过因果时空注意力机制建模水成物下降、融化和蒸发过程。

Result: 在RAIN-F和MeteoNet数据集上，MAE降低超过13.31%，重建降雨场的结构保真度显著提升。

Conclusion: RainSeer成功融合物理先验与深度学习，实现了更准确、更精细的降雨场重建，为气象和水文应用提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution rainfall fields is essential for flood
forecasting, hydrological modeling, and climate analysis. However, existing
spatial interpolation methods-whether based on automatic weather station (AWS)
measurements or enhanced with satellite/radar observations often over-smooth
critical structures, failing to capture sharp transitions and localized
extremes. We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework
that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural
prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however,
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution
volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii)
bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level
precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage
architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by
projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall,
through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the
semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and
evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate
RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France,
2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines,
reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in
reconstructed rainfall fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态提示优化无法适应输入、用户或环境变化，亟需一种动态、个性化的调整机制。

Method: 使用小规模参数化模型作为顾问模型，通过强化学习根据环境奖励生成上下文提示，实时引导黑盒模型行为。

Result: Advisor Models在推理与个性化任务中优于静态提示优化，支持跨模型迁移，具备对分布外输入的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Advisor Models提供了一种可学习的黑盒系统接口，是实现个性化与环境自适应AI的有前景方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where
model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting.
While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed
prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We
introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with
reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering
instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small
model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a
per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple
domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models
outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and
improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability
of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the
framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to
out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a
learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a
parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of
black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling
personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖启发式加权融合多个效用信号（如不确定性、稀有性、多样性），缺乏统一框架且调参困难。

Method: 采用LMSR市场机制为每个样本定价，以信号为交易者，通过价格/token规则和轻量多样性头控制长度偏置与覆盖，结合主题聚类与有效样本量评估覆盖。

Result: 在GSM8K上达到与强基线相当性能，降低种子方差，选择开销<0.1 GPU-hr；在AGNews上提升平衡性与稳定性，准确率保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了多信号数据筛选，提供可解释、可调、低开销的解决方案，适用于提示推理与分类任务。

Abstract: Selecting a small yet useful subset of training data is hard because signals
of example utility (uncertainty, rarity, diversity, etc.) are heterogeneous and
typically combined with ad hoc weights. We propose a market-based selector that
prices each example via a cost-function prediction market (LMSR), signals act
as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration, and topic-wise
normalization stabilizes calibration. Token budgets are handled explicitly by a
price-per-token rule $\rho=p/\ell^{\gamma}$, with $\gamma$ exposing an
interpretable length bias; a lightweight diversity head improves coverage. We
quantify coverage via topic cluster coverage and effective sample size. On the
theory side, we show that LMSR implements a maximum-entropy aggregation with
exponential weighting and a convex objective, yielding transparent knobs for
aggregation strength. Empirically, on GSM8K (60k-token budget) the market with
diversity achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while reducing
seed variance and incurring $<\!0.1$ GPU-hr selection overhead; on AGNews at
kept=5-25\% the market (with light balancing) delivers competitive accuracy
with improved balance and stability. The framework unifies multi-signal data
curation under fixed compute for prompt-level reasoning and classification.

Motivation: 为保障安全关键场景中模型部署的可靠性，需深入探究后训练量化（PTQ）在不同输入分布下引发的性能骤降风险。

Method: 通过知识蒸馏与强化学习联合优化网络与比特宽度策略，模拟并分析最坏情况下量化导致的极端性能损失。

Result: 发现存在高风险的网络-策略对，其准确率在量化后下降10-65%，远超稳健模型的<2%下降；识别出最脆弱的输入特征与量化点。

Conclusion: PTQ在实际部署中存在严重安全风险，呼吁未来研究重视模型鲁棒性与安全性评估。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool
for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network
by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this
paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there
is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the
distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible
deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the
extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input
distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the
idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge
distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width
policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in
terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this
"detrimental" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating
performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their
"robust" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic
experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into
points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step
toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately
emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this
work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis
on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep
learning.

Conclusion: SAGE提供了一种内存恒定、实用的高效训练替代方案，可与剪枝和模型压缩技术互补，适用于大规模数据训练场景。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
energy intensive. We present SAGE, a streaming data-subset selection method
that maintains a compact Frequent Directions (FD) sketch of gradient geometry
in $O(\ell D)$ memory and prioritizes examples whose sketched gradients align
with a consensus direction. The approach eliminates $N \times N$ pairwise
similarities and explicit $N \times \ell$ gradient stores, yielding a simple
two-pass, GPU-friendly pipeline. Leveraging FD's deterministic approximation
guarantees, we analyze how agreement scoring preserves gradient energy within
the principal sketched subspace. Across multiple benchmarks, SAGE trains with
small kept-rate budgets while retaining competitive accuracy relative to
full-data training and recent subset-selection baselines, and reduces
end-to-end compute and peak memory. Overall, SAGE offers a practical,
constant-memory alternative that complements pruning and model compression for
efficient training.

Motivation: 上下文学习模型对上下文敏感，如何在无真实标签下选择最优模型集成是开放问题

Method: 利用TabPFN预测的四分位距（IQR）作为不确定性指标，选择低IQR模型进行集成

Result: 仅用序列特征的TabPFN超越专用SOTA模型，低IQR集成显著优于单模型或随机集成

Conclusion: 模型不确定性是无标签优化生物分子预测的强大启发式方法

Abstract: In-context learners like TabPFN are promising for biomolecule efficacy
prediction, where established molecular feature sets and relevant experimental
results can serve as powerful contextual examples. However, their performance
is highly sensitive to the provided context, making strategies like post-hoc
ensembling of models trained on different data subsets a viable approach. An
open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access
to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided
strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy
task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass
specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's
predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a
negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an
ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance
compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available
data. This finding highlights model uncertainty as a powerful, label-free
heuristic for optimizing biomolecule efficacy predictions.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and
massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation

Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies
through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our
approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to
maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with
standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B
parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates
substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and
$55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters.
These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad
applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training
phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

Motivation: 现有算法要么依赖已知的事实表示，要么无法利用因子结构，导致在高维观测下效率低下。

Method: 提出Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF)，利用动作对少量因子的稀疏影响，通过对比学习提取可控潜在变量。

Result: 在Taxi、FourRooms和MiniGrid-DoorKey三个基准上，ACF显著优于基线去相关算法，准确恢复真实可控因子。

Conclusion: ACF成功 bridging 了因子化MDP与深度强化学习之间的表示鸿沟，为高维观测下的高效学习提供新路径。

Abstract: Algorithms that exploit factored Markov decision processes are far more
sample-efficient than factor-agnostic methods, yet they assume a factored
representation is known a priori -- a requirement that breaks down when the
agent sees only high-dimensional observations. Conversely, deep reinforcement
learning handles such inputs but cannot benefit from factored structure. We
address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization
(ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable
latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF
leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while
the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for
contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors
directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored
structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently
outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.

Conclusion: DRL与有界ES相结合可显著提升复杂时变系统的控制鲁棒性与效率，具有实际工程应用价值

Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum
seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL
has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize
the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades
catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES
can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its
convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and,
like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We
demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller
whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of
historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a
desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We
present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined
ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section

*Jiangnan Li,Thuy-Trang Vu,Ehsan Abbasnejad,Gholamreza Haffari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SFT被证明等价于逆强化学习，可提取密集奖励模型并用于提升策略性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为SFT只是模仿学习，本文挑战此观点，提出其本质是逆强化学习

Method: 证明SFT是Inverse Q-Learning的特例，提出基于基线的奖励函数来恢复密集奖励信号

Result: 成功从SFT模型中提取稀疏奖励，利用Dense-Path REINFORCE在指令跟随任务上超越原始SFT模型

Conclusion: SFT不仅是策略模仿，更是强大的奖励学习机制，为利用专家示范提供了新途径

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation
learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on
demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a
fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We
prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which
implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an
implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert
demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly
from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The
availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing
granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key
application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with
reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently
outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This
work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward
learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert
demonstrations.

TL;DR: 提出一种残差学习框架，通过多交叉条阵列逐步补偿低精度权重更新的误差，实现在4位分辨率memristive设备上的高效模拟训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模拟内存计算（AIMC）需8位导电态以匹配数字基线，但实际器件如ReRAM仅支持约4位分辨率，导致训练精度严重下降。

Method: 提出残差学习框架，顺序在多个交叉条阵列上学习，逐步修正低精度权重更新的残差误差。

Result: 理论证明收敛速率线性提升，实验在图像分类基准上显著优于现有方法，硬件开销适中。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决低精度模拟训练的精度瓶颈，为实际memristive器件的片上训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural
network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays,
where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive
devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least
8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such
fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation
techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In
practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about
4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update
precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training
with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \emph{residual
learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to
compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of
tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image
classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state
settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our
cost analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视图的谱特征向量诱导的几何结构与全局结构，导致生成能力受限

Method: 将输入图与目标图嵌入黎曼流形，定义谱特征映射间的测地线流，匹配流上的分布以生成图

Result: 在多个基准上达到SOTA性能，比扩散模型快达30倍，且能泛化至未见图规模

Conclusion: SFMG通过融合谱几何与流匹配，为图生成提供了新范式

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental task with wide applications in modeling
complex systems. Although existing methods align the spectrum or degree profile
of the target graph, they often ignore the geometry induced by eigenvectors and
the global structure of the graph. In this work, we propose Spectral Geodesic
Flow Matching (SFMG), a novel framework that uses spectral eigenmaps to embed
both input and target graphs into continuous Riemannian manifolds. We then
define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these
flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i)
captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible
generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG
matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and
spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to
30$\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial
advantage in scalability and training efficiency. We also demonstrate its
ability to generalize to unseen graph scales. Overall, SFMG provides a new
approach to graph synthesis by integrating spectral geometry with flow
matching.

TL;DR: 提出基于Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC)的模型与脑响应比较方法，证明深度神经网络可准确模拟大脑机制，消除预测性与机制准确性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型与脑响应比较方法缺乏共识，亟需一种能同时提升预测精度与机制解释力的系统性方法。

Method: 引入IATC——用于在个体间精确映射神经响应的最严格函数集合，通过双向映射评估模型能否模拟典型个体的神经响应模式，并在模拟网络、小鼠和人类数据中验证。

Result: IATC能精确识别非线性激活函数等机制细节，实现高预测性与高特异性（区分类脑区、对齐同脑区响应），支持TDANN作为视觉系统模型。

Conclusion: IATC为模型与脑比较提供了原则性框架，证明预测性与机制准确性可兼得，革新了神经网络模型验证方法。

Abstract: Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models
of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for
comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in
philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the
Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to
accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using
the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and
brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject
using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We
identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network
models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We
find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as
the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC
enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high
specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate
response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning
same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a
proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural
engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal
of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided
transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural
networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables
principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the
predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon
previous approaches to model-brain comparison.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于注意力的GRU自编码器AttentiveGRUAE，用于从可穿戴数据中进行时间聚类与抑郁预测，性能优于基线模型且具临床可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时捕捉 longitudinal 可穿戴数据中的行为模式、抑郁风险与子群差异，亟需联合优化表示学习、分类与聚类的模型。

Method: AttentiveGRUAE 联合优化三目标：1）序列重构学习低维行为表示；2）二分类预测期末抑郁率；3）基于GMM的软聚类识别行为子群，并引入注意力机制提升可解释性。

Result: 在GLOBEM 2018-2019数据集上，聚类轮廓系数达0.70，抑郁AUC为0.74，显著优于基线；2020-2021外部验证保持稳定（轮廓系数0.63，AUC 0.61），注意力可视化揭示睡眠规律性关键时间窗口。

Conclusion: AttentiveGRUAE 能有效整合表示学习、分类与聚类，实现高精度、可解释的纵向行为分析，为个体化精神健康监测提供新工具。

Abstract: In this study, we present AttentiveGRUAE, a novel attention-based gated
recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder designed for temporal clustering and
prediction of outcome from longitudinal wearable data. Our model jointly
optimizes three objectives: (1) learning a compact latent representation of
daily behavioral features via sequence reconstruction, (2) predicting
end-of-period depression rate through a binary classification head, and (3)
identifying behavioral subtypes through Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) based soft
clustering of learned embeddings. We evaluate AttentiveGRUAE on longitudinal
sleep data from 372 participants (GLOBEM 2018-2019), and it demonstrates
superior performance over baseline clustering, domain-aligned self-supervised,
and ablated models in both clustering quality (silhouette score = 0.70 vs
0.32-0.70) and depression classification (AUC = 0.74 vs 0.50-0.67).
Additionally, external validation on cross-year cohorts from 332 participants
(GLOBEM 2020-2021) confirms cluster reproducibility (silhouette score = 0.63,
AUC = 0.61) and stability. We further perform subtype analysis and visualize
temporal attention, which highlights sleep-related differences between clusters
and identifies salient time windows that align with changes in sleep
regularity, yielding clinically interpretable explanations of risk.

Conclusion: 高阶导数是提升GNN表达力的有效新途径，连接子图GNN与结构编码，具有理论与实践价值。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), their limited
expressivity remains a fundamental challenge. Research on GNN expressivity has
produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies
with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs
with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the
oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To
date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN
expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural
way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN
(HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing
Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base
model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings
processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture.
Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive
power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between
HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For
computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing
high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.
Evaluations on popular graph learning benchmarks demonstrate HOD-GNN's strong
performance on popular graph learning tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have been supported by the emergence of
domain-specific software libraries, enabling streamlined workflows and
increased reproducibility. For geospatial machine learning (GeoML), the
availability of Earth observation data has outpaced the development of domain
libraries to handle its unique challenges, such as varying spatial resolutions,
spectral properties, temporal cadence, data coverage, coordinate systems, and
file formats. This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of GeoML
libraries, analyzing their evolution, core functionalities, and the current
ecosystem. It also introduces popular GeoML libraries such as TorchGeo,
eo-learn, and Raster Vision, detailing their architecture, supported data
types, and integration with ML frameworks. Additionally, it discusses common
methodologies for data preprocessing, spatial--temporal joins, benchmarking,
and the use of pretrained models. Through a case study in crop type mapping, it
demonstrates practical applications of these tools. Best practices in software
design, licensing, and testing are highlighted, along with open challenges and
future directions, particularly the rise of foundation models and the need for
governance in open-source geospatial software. Our aim is to guide
practitioners, developers, and researchers in navigating and contributing to
the rapidly evolving GeoML landscape.

TL;DR: 提出MINTO方法，通过取目标网络和在线网络的最小值估计，实现快速且稳定的值函数学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标网络稳定但更新慢，在线网络高效但不稳定，亟需兼顾两者优势。

Method: 引入MINTO更新规则，选择目标网络与在线网络估计值中的最小值作为目标。

Result: MINTO在多种RL算法和基准上显著提升性能，兼顾稳定性与学习速度。

Conclusion: MINTO是一种简单、通用且高效的改进方法，适用于广泛的价值型和策略梯度算法。

Abstract: The use of target networks is a popular approach for estimating value
functions in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). While effective, the target
network remains a compromise solution that preserves stability at the cost of
slowly moving targets, thus delaying learning. Conversely, using the online
network as a bootstrapped target is intuitively appealing, albeit well-known to
lead to unstable learning. In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both
worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the
MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our
method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that
MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the
potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping.
Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based
and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO
extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well
as discrete and continuous action spaces. Across all benchmarks, MINTO
consistently improves performance, demonstrating its broad applicability and
effectiveness.

Conclusion: 理论引导的物理 grounded 方法为未来“无处不在”的水文模型奠定基础，推动空间与时间变化过程主导性的架构化编码。

Abstract: While many modern studies are dedicated to ML-based large-sample hydrologic
modeling, these efforts have not necessarily translated into predictive
improvements that are grounded in enhanced physical-conceptual understanding.
Here, we report on a CONUS-wide large-sample study (spanning diverse
hydro-geo-climatic conditions) using ML-augmented physically-interpretable
catchment-scale models of varying complexity based in the Mass-Conserving
Perceptron (MCP). Results were evaluated using attribute masks such as snow
regime, forest cover, and climate zone. Our results indicate the importance of
selecting model architectures of appropriate model complexity based on how
process dominance varies with hydrological regime. Benchmark comparisons show
that physically-interpretable mass-conserving MCP-based models can achieve
performance comparable to data-based models based in the Long Short-Term Memory
network (LSTM) architecture. Overall, this study highlights the potential of a
theory-informed, physically grounded approach to large-sample hydrology, with
emphasis on mechanistic understanding and the development of parsimonious and
interpretable model architectures, thereby laying the foundation for future
models of everywhere that architecturally encode information about spatially-
and temporally-varying process dominance.

Motivation: 传统特征过滤方法依赖成对统计依赖度量，难以捕捉目标与特征间高阶交互关系。

Method: 采用神经网络估算互信息，设计带有稀疏正则化的损失函数，并通过两阶段流程解耦表征学习与特征选择。

Result: 在合成与真实欺诈数据集上验证了方法能有效捕捉复杂特征-目标关系，实现精确解。

Conclusion: MINERVA 在处理高阶特征交互方面显著优于传统方法，具有更好的泛化能力和特征重要性表达。

Abstract: Existing feature filters rely on statistical pair-wise dependence metrics to
model feature-target relationships, but this approach may fail when the target
depends on higher-order feature interactions rather than individual
contributions. We introduce Mutual Information Neural Estimation Regularized
Vetting Algorithm (MINERVA), a novel approach to supervised feature selection
based on neural estimation of mutual information between features and targets.
We paramaterize the approximation of mutual information with neural networks
and perform feature selection using a carefully designed loss function
augmented with sparsity-inducing regularizers. Our method is implemented in a
two-stage process to decouple representation learning from feature selection,
ensuring better generalization and a more accurate expression of feature
importance. We present examples of ubiquitous dependency structures that are
rarely captured in literature and show that our proposed method effectively
captures these complex feature-target relationships by evaluating feature
subsets as an ensemble. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life fraud
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method and its ability to perform
exact solutions.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive problem in tabular settings. Existing solutions
range from simple averaging to complex generative adversarial networks.
However, due to huge variance in performance across real-world domains and

Building on TabPFN, a recent tabular foundation model for supervised learning,
we propose TabImpute, a pre-trained transformer that delivers accurate and fast
zero-shot imputations requiring no fitting or hyperparameter tuning at
inference-time. To train and evaluate TabImpute, we introduce (i) an entry-wise
featurization for tabular settings, which enables a $100\times$ speedup over
the previous TabPFN imputation method, (ii) a synthetic training data
generation pipeline incorporating realistic missingness patterns, which boosts
test-time performance, and (iii) MissBench, a comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of imputation methods with $42$ OpenML datasets and $13$ missingness
patterns. MissBench spans domains such as medicine, finance, and engineering,

Motivation: 现有LoRA和AdaLoRA方法在参数秩分配上缺乏灵活性，AdaLoRA收敛慢、计算开销大。

Method: 使用基于注意力的超网络动态生成SVD分解参数(P, Λ, Q)，并通过剪枝超网络输出实现动态秩分配。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上加速收敛，性能保持不变，且可推广至其他LoRA变体。

Conclusion: HyperAdaLoRA有效提升AdaLoRA效率，为参数高效微调提供新方向。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language
models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA
assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting
for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and
layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize
updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank
allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training
process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high
computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel
framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a
hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value
Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on
attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the
outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank
allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and
models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without
sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other
LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统优化了drive-by检测平台，提出了专用检测车辆设计准则，为桥梁智能监测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Drive-by inspection for bridge health monitoring has gained increasing
attention over the past decade. This method involves analysing the coupled
vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to
assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical
and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting
the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for
optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An
unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used
to reconstruct the frequency-domain representation of acceleration responses.
The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are
optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index
distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is
employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify
optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional
parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3
and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective,
while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower
natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to
rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a
purpose-built inspection vehicle.

Conclusion: TutorBench为下一代AI家教模型开发提供了全面且未饱和的评估基准，揭示当前模型在教学能力上的显著不足。

Abstract: As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids,
it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of
tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive,
provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce
TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate
the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated
by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples
are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive
explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable
feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through
effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring,
samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge
model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained
automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific
rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed
analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the
frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\%$, showing a large room for
improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of
tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively,
with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\%$ pass rate on rubric
criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families
exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others
in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use
cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated
benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.

*Yongyi Yang,Tomaso Poggio,Isaac Chuang,Liu Ziyin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文证明了在广义置换等变学习规则下，训练过程对神经元分布的拓扑结构施加强约束，并揭示了学习率高于临界值时拓扑简化会降低模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度神经网络训练过程中神经元拓扑结构的动态变化，以及学习率对拓扑稳定性的影响。

Method: 通过数学证明，分析置换等变学习规则（如SGD、Adam）诱导的双利普希茨映射，刻画神经元分布的拓扑约束。

Result: 低于临界学习率η*时拓扑结构被保留；高于η*时发生拓扑简化，模型表达力下降；该理论与“稳定边缘”现象结合，揭示训练的两阶段动态。

Conclusion: 该理论不依赖具体架构或损失函数，为深度学习提供普适的拓扑分析框架。

Abstract: We prove that for a broad class of permutation-equivariant learning rules
(including SGD, Adam, and others), the training process induces a bi-Lipschitz
mapping between neurons and strongly constrains the topology of the neuron
distribution during training. This result reveals a qualitative difference
between small and large learning rates $\eta$. With a learning rate below a
topological critical point $\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve
all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\eta^*$, the
learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron
manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity.
Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability
phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can
be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under
topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through
drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is
independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal
application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生成AI模型的低精度部署需要避免反量化开销，传统方法无法兼顾数值稳定性和效率，亟需理论指导的新型浮点格式。

Method: 发现权重指数符合α-稳定分布，理论证明其熵有界，推导出理论压缩极限FP4.67，并设计熵感知编码与GPU优化解码的ECF8格式。

Result: 在671B参数模型上实现无损计算，内存节省26.9%，吞吐加速177.1%，输出完全无偏差。

Conclusion: 指数集中是训练模型的统计规律，为FP8时代无损低精度浮点设计提供了理论基石。

Abstract: The scaling of Generative AI (GenAI) models into the hundreds of billions of
parameters makes low-precision computation indispensable for efficient
deployment. We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing
low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical
stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization
overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an
exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently
exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this
arises naturally from $\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic
gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our
analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which
motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we
propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with
entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs
up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1%
throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no
deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a
statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless
low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.

Abstract: Recently, neural operators have emerged as powerful tools for learning
mappings between function spaces, enabling data-driven simulations of complex
dynamics. Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning
mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators
into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2)
Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several
viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven
dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to
explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural
operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this
explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent
need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple
dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that
dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn
complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the
critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into
neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden
physical phenomena.

Result: 在动态柔性作业车间调度问题上验证，EvoSpeak显著提升启发式质量、收敛速度，并输出可读性报告

Conclusion: EvoSpeak通过融合GP与LLM的优势，推动了智能、透明、用户友好的启发式算法发展

Abstract: Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving
tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic
and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly
complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting
transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak,
a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to
enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution.
EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and
leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate
convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language
explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge
transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We
verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic
flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective
formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective
heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable
reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP
with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the
development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for
real-world optimization problems.

Conclusion: 基于采样重加权与噪声结构的微调方法，可有效超越传统策略梯度，为扩散模型优化提供新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While
pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data
distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward
functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such
as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of
autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such
methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals
and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based
Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with
reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at
intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to
more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance
tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve
flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our
methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule
generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied
to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I
benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over
the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction
improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风险厌恶离线RL方法在安全性和价值保守性之间权衡，限制了策略表达能力，而表达性强的策略通常仅用于无风险场景。

Method: 引入RAMAC框架，使用生成式行动者（扩散模型和流匹配）与分布性评论家，联合优化分布风险与行为克隆损失。

Result: 在Stochastic-D4RL任务上，RAMAC一致提升了CVaR_{0.1}，同时保持了高回报。

Conclusion: RAMAC成功实现了在复杂多模态场景中兼顾风险敏感性与策略表达能力，填补了风险厌恶与表达性策略之间的空白。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains where online data collection is infeasible,
offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers an attractive alternative but only
if policies deliver high returns without incurring catastrophic lower-tail
risk. Prior work on risk-averse offline RL achieves safety at the cost of value
conservatism and restricted policy classes, whereas expressive policies are
only used in risk-neutral settings. Here, we address this gap by introducing
the \textbf{Risk-Aware Multimodal Actor-Critic (RAMAC)} framework, which
couples an \emph{expressive generative actor} with a distributional critic. The
RAMAC differentiates composite objective combining distributional risk and BC
loss through the generative path, achieving risk-sensitive learning in complex
multimodal scenarios. We instantiate RAMAC with diffusion and flow-matching
actors and observe consistent gains in $\mathrm{CVaR}_{0.1}$ while maintaining
strong returns on most Stochastic-D4RL tasks. Code:

Abstract: The growing integration of drones across commercial, industrial, and civilian
domains has introduced significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly due
to the susceptibility of drone networks to a wide range of cyberattacks.
Existing intrusion detection mechanisms often lack the adaptability,
efficiency, and generalizability required for the dynamic and resource
constrained environments in which drones operate. This paper proposes TSLT-Net,
a novel lightweight and unified Temporal Spatial Transformer based intrusion
detection system tailored specifically for drone networks. By leveraging self
attention mechanisms, TSLT-Net effectively models both temporal patterns and
spatial dependencies in network traffic, enabling accurate detection of diverse
intrusion types. The framework includes a streamlined preprocessing pipeline
and supports both multiclass attack classification and binary anomaly detection
within a single architecture. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISOT Drone
Anomaly Detection Dataset, consisting of more than 2.3 million labeled records,
demonstrate the superior performance of TSLT-Net with 99.99 percent accuracy in
multiclass detection and 100 percent in binary anomaly detection, while
maintaining a minimal memory footprint of only 0.04 MB and 9722 trainable
parameters. These results establish TSLT-Net as an effective and scalable
solution for real time drone cybersecurity, particularly suitable for
deployment on edge devices in mission critical UAV systems.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction,
Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) for capturing temporal
dependencies, and a dual attention mechanism, channel and temporal attention,
to enhance focus on critical patterns in the data. The proposed method was
trained and evaluated on the Edge IIoTset dataset, a comprehensive and
realistic benchmark containing more than 2.2 million labeled instances spanning
15 attack types and benign traffic, collected from a seven layer industrial
testbed. Our proposed model achieves outstanding accuracy for both 15 attack
types and benign traffic. CST AFNet achieves 99.97 percent accuracy. Moreover,
this model demonstrates exceptional performance with macro averaged precision,
recall, and F1 score all above 99.3 percent. Experimental results show that CST
AFNet achieves superior detection accuracy, significantly outperforming
traditional deep learning models. The findings confirm that CST AFNet is a
powerful and scalable solution for real time cyber threat detection in complex
IoT and IIoT environments, paving the way for more secure, intelligent, and

Result: 揭示了损失面的渐近特征（如有效维度与最佳损失），并推导出可解释和外推随机搜索收敛的新定律。

Conclusion: 新工具可用于计算性能置信区间与有效超参数数量，已开源。

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models
are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that
train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters.
Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter
loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory
yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the
optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic
features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover
this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search.
Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new
distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the
loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new
asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its
convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals
for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of
hyperparameters. We make these tools available at

Abstract: Deep time series forecasting has emerged as a booming direction in recent
years. Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are
sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor
improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike
image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100%
accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound
due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research
objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a
fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time
series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics,
e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related
to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting
paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of
over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant
exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models
and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy
law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated
tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy
for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for
optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in
computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient
descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological
systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically
inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,
which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during
the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization
scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the
density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the
stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is
the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE
governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the
corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which
surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential
gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new
formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss
function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally
distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns
out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for
image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample
generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,
Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the
new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a
biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,
founded on geometric Brownian motion.

Conclusion: HCA与CSADA相互增强，形成良性循环，显著提升图聚类的表示判别性。

Abstract: Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and
clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great
success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive
objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary
information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on
node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding
augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding
augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all
contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences
between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits
their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust
attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative
augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness
(CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding
representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a
more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive
learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides
edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high
confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively
identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an
innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually
reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability
in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against
several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.

Motivation: 传统LLM服务系统因非抢占式调度和反应式内存管理，在请求突发时资源利用率低、并行处理能力差，影响流式生成的响应性与稳定性。

Method: TokenFlow引入抢占式请求调度与主动KV缓存管理，动态基于缓冲区占用率和令牌消耗率优先排序请求，并后台异步迁移KV缓存，重叠I/O与计算以降低抢占开销。

Result: 在Llama3-8B和Qwen2.5-32B多GPU实验中，TokenFlow有效吞吐量提升高达82.5%，P99 TTFT降低达80.2%，且不牺牲整体令牌吞吐量。

Conclusion: TokenFlow通过协同优化调度与缓存管理，实现了流式LLM服务中响应性与稳定性的双赢，适用于高并发实时交互场景。

Abstract: Real-time LLM interactions demand streamed token generations, where text
tokens are progressively generated and delivered to users while balancing two
objectives: responsiveness (i.e., low time-to-first-token) and steady
generation (i.e.,required time-between-tokens). Standard LLM serving systems
suffer from the inflexibility caused by non-preemptive request scheduling and
reactive memory management, leading to poor resource utilization and low
request processing parallelism under request bursts. Therefore, we present
TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance
via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache
management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token
buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV
cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with
computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on
Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200)
demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput
(accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to
80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.

*Hugo Ninou,Jonathan Kadmon,N. Alex Cayco-Gajic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 非梯度的‘涡旋’项在神经网络学习中可能存在并增强优化效果，挑战了仅依赖梯度下降的主流理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物神经网络是否使用类似梯度下降的学习机制尚不明确，且多种突触可塑性规则是否近似梯度下降仍不清楚。

Method: 在学生-教师框架下分析前馈网络，通过引入规则反转的可塑性来系统性地引入非梯度‘涡旋’项，研究其对学习动态和性能的影响。

Result: 小涡旋项保持解流形稳定，类似梯度下降；强涡旋项可能 destabilize 解流形，导致混沌或意外加速学习，尤其在特定架构中可逃离鞍点。

Conclusion: 多样化的学习规则（非梯度项）在某些架构中可实现鲁棒学习，为生物学习机制提供了替代梯度下降的理论支持。

Abstract: Gradient-based algorithms are a cornerstone of artificial neural network
training, yet it remains unclear whether biological neural networks use similar
gradient-based strategies during learning. Experiments often discover a
diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an
approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously
overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally
non-gradient "curl"-like components while still being able to effectively
optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with
inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity,
resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any
objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze
feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher
framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons
exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of
the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to
gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the
solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of
stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In
other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to
gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by
temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures
capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an
important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in
neural networks.

Motivation: 开源大模型可通过简单激活编辑被篡改，需评估常见安全训练方法（如拒绝训练）是否仍有效。

Method: 提出模型破坏（abliteration）投影技术，移除拒绝敏感方向，在SmolLM2-1.7B及其20个检查点上进行控制实验，使用多评判者对100个有害/无害提示分类响应，验证评判一致性，并探查模型自识别拒绝能力。

Result: 量化了不同安全预训练组件在编辑下的鲁棒性，揭示评判者选择对评估结果影响显著，确认部分安全机制失效。

Conclusion: 建议在安全评估中集成推理时编辑方法，为开源模型安全测试提供可复现协议。

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation
edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety
interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We
study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove
refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a
granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside
widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated,
we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify
responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate
judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models
can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a
checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components
remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences
evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating
inference-time edits into safety assessments. Code:

TL;DR: 本文证明了使用深度ReLU网络的梯度下降可达到与核方法最优速率相当的泛化速率，仅具深度的多项式依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有结果在深度网络中泛化速率次优或对深度呈指数依赖，亟需更优分析。

Method: 通过精细权衡优化与泛化误差，结合对参考模型附近激活模式的新控制，推导出更优的Rademacher复杂度界。

Result: 在NTK可分假设下，得到泛化误差为$	ilde{O}(L^4 (1 + eta L^2) / (n eta^2))$，逼近最优SVM型速率。

Conclusion: 首次实现深度ReLU网络的最优泛化速率，突破了此前深度依赖的指数障碍。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the
generalization performance of gradient descent (GD) methods in deep neural
networks. A natural and fundamental question is whether GD can achieve
generalization rates comparable to the minimax optimal rates established in the
kernel setting. Existing results either yield suboptimal rates of
$O(1/\sqrt{n})$, or focus on networks with smooth activation functions,
incurring exponential dependence on network depth $L$. In this work, we
establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by
carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only
polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the
data are NTK separable from the margin $\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate
of $\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \gamma L^2) / (n \gamma^2))$, which aligns with the
optimal SVM-type rate $\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent
factors. A key technical contribution is our novel control of activation
patterns near a reference model, enabling a sharper Rademacher complexity bound
for deep ReLU networks trained with gradient descent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有在线共形预测方法在更新阈值时仅依赖预测是否包含真实值（二元判断），忽略预测区间的实际相关性，导致阈值波动大、区间过宽。

Method: 用连续函数量化预测区间与真实值的相关性，替代传统的inside/outside二元评估，优化阈值更新策略。

Result: 在真实数据集上实验表明，新方法能在保持覆盖有效性的同时生成更窄的预测区间。

Conclusion: 引入相关性感知的阈值更新机制是提升在线共形预测性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works
in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in
this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP)
becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time.
Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the
miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To
evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically
considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width
minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run
coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during
the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity
of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside
or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this
paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose
enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation
(inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance
of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent
abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction
intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that
these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods
while maintaining coverage validity.

Motivation: 大语言模型推理能耗持续增长，但现有研究仅使用粗粒度模型级指标，缺乏细粒度能耗测量方法，能耗效率常被忽视。

Method: 提出CLEAR方法，通过重复采样解决微秒级组件执行与毫秒级能耗传感器间的时间不匹配问题，对15种模型的组件级能耗进行精准测量。

Result: 注意力模块每FLOP能耗显著更高，能耗与FLOPs不呈线性关系；组件级能耗方差低于9.5%，捕获超90%的总能耗。

Conclusion: FLOPs不能准确反映组件级能耗，应基于细粒度基线进行组件级优化以实现高效Transformer模型设计。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant
environmental concerns. Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference
occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy
footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level
metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy
efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the
first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core
components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology,
Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome
temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring
of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models
spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise
energy variance below 9.5\% while capturing more than 90\% of the model's total
energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention
blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP),
indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP
counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a
component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy
baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient
transformer models through component-level optimizations.

Motivation: 现有方法如Group DRO虽能应对组间偏移，但对少数群体内部的分布偏移脆弱，而这类偏移在真实场景中频繁发生

Method: 构建层次化Group DRO，扩展模糊集以同时建模组间与组内不确定性，并设计新的基准测试模拟现实中的少数群体分布偏移

Result: 在新基准上显著优于现有方法，同时保持或提升标准基准性能

Conclusion: 应扩大模糊集以全面捕捉组间与组内分布不确定性，推动鲁棒学习研究走向更现实的场景

Abstract: Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious
correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address
this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed.
While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they
remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur
in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of
Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties,
providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also
introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group
distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in
spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under
these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while
also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results
highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both
inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.

Motivation: 随机顺序模型虽渐近等价于随机独立同分布模型，但有限时间内存在显著非平稳性，导致部分随机算法失效，而对抗算法虽稳健但性能较差，亟需兼顾两者优势的自适应方法。

Method: 提出一种通用模板，通过调整随机学习算法以适应随机顺序输入，在不显著损害原后悔界的前提下提升其在该模型下的表现。

Result: 成功改进了延迟预测、带约束在线学习和带切换成本的多臂赌博机的后悔界；并证明在线分类的可学习性由VC维决定，区别于对抗模型中的Littlestone维。

Conclusion: 随机顺序模型下可通过模板化方法适配随机算法，并获得与对抗模型本质不同的学习性刻画，凸显其独特理论性质。

Abstract: In the random-order model for online learning,
  the sequence of losses is chosen upfront by an adversary and presented to the
learner
  after a random permutation. Any random-order input is \emph{asymptotically}
equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit
significant {\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of
stochastic learning algorithms.
  While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret
guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the
stochastic model that fail against random-order instances.
  In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning
algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their
regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for
prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with
switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that,
in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than
the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general
adversarial model.

Motivation: 神经网络加速器昂贵且难以应对实时工作负载波动，需更高效的量化方法以平衡精度与性能。

Method: FlexiQ根据特征通道的值范围选择性应用低比特计算，并采用高效的降比特方法减少量化误差，同时动态调整低比特通道比例。

Result: 在11个视觉模型上，FlexiQ比现有方法平均提升6.6%精度；50% 4-bit模型仅损失0.6%精度，但获得40%的加速，且硬件运行开销极小。

Conclusion: FlexiQ实现了精度、延迟与硬件效率的最优权衡，适用于实时动态负载场景。

Abstract: Neural networks commonly execute on hardware accelerators such as NPUs and
GPUs for their size and computation overhead. These accelerators are costly and
it is hard to scale their resources to handle real-time workload fluctuations.
  We present FlexiQ, an adaptive mixed-precision quantization scheme for
computer vision models. FlexiQ selectively applies low-bitwidth computation to
feature channels with small value ranges and employs an efficient bit-lowering
method to minimize quantization errors while maintaining inference accuracy.
Furthermore, FlexiQ adjusts its low-bitwidth channel ratio in real time,
enabling quantized models to effectively manage fluctuating inference workload.
  We implemented FlexiQ prototype, including the mixed-precision inference
runtime on our custom NPU and GPUs. Evaluated on eleven convolution- and
transformer-based vision models, FlexiQ achieves on average 6.6% higher
accuracy for 4-bit models with finetuning and outperforms four state-of-the-art
quantization techniques. Moreover, our mixed-precision models achieved an
efficient accuracy-latency trade-off, with the 50% 4-bit model incurring only
0.6% accuracy loss while achieving 40% of the speedup of the 100% 4-bit model
over 8-bit model. Latency evaluations on our NPU and GPUs confirmed that FlexiQ
introduces minimal runtime overhead, demonstrating its hardware efficiency and
overall performance benefits.

Motivation: 传统SSM在提升表达能力时面临计算负担随状态维度增加的问题，亟需在表达力与效率间取得平衡。

Method: 利用汉克尔矩阵的特征值稳定性，在训练中识别并保留高影响力状态维度，对线性时不变SSM（如LRU）进行在线平衡截断，可扩展至选择性模型。

Result: 训练中压缩显著加速优化，压缩模型保留了关键任务结构，性能优于直接训练的小尺寸模型。

Conclusion: 先大后小的训练策略使SSM在高效计算的同时维持更高性能，为状态空间模型的高效设计提供新范式。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), developed to tackle long sequence modeling tasks
efficiently, offer both parallelizable training and fast inference. At their
core are recurrent dynamical systems that maintain a hidden state, with update
costs scaling with the state dimension. A key design challenge is striking the
right balance between maximizing expressivity and limiting this computational
burden. Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis,
provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well
as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller
representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability
properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training,
where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our
approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units,
but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training
reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity,
with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained
directly at smaller dimension. In other words, SSMs that begin large and shrink
during training achieve computational efficiency while maintaining higher
performance.

Result: 实验验证了各设计选择对生成质量和速度的贡献，并扩展至图生成和天气预报。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了VAR与扩散模型，支持少步并行生成，并可集成扩散生态工具。

Abstract: We revisit Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models through the lens of an
iterative-refinement framework. Rather than viewing VAR solely as next-scale
autoregression, we formalise it as a deterministic forward process that
constructs a Laplacian-style latent pyramid, paired with a learned backward
process that reconstructs it in a small number of coarse-to-fine steps. This
view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that
help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space,
casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and
partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to
quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how
the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to
probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting. The framework
also suggests practical interfaces for VAR to leverage tools from the diffusion
ecosystem while retaining few-step, scale-parallel generation.

Motivation: 现有深度学习和梯度提升模型在个性化健康预测中缺乏可解释性，且难以应对个体间巨大差异。

Method: 结合主体自适应稀疏线性回归、基于F检验的特征消除、回归后阈值处理，以及基于置信度的LightGBM集成。

Result: 在CH-2025数据集上，SASL-LightGBM性能与黑箱模型相当，但参数更少、可解释性更强。

Conclusion: SASL框架为临床实践提供了准确、透明且可操作的个性化健康预测方法。

Abstract: Improved prediction of personalized health outcomes -- such as sleep quality
and stress -- from multimodal lifelog data could have meaningful clinical and
practical implications. However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural
networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to
adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in
lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive
Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly
designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least
squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically
distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative
backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a
sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health
outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we
develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to
maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically
challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact
LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without
compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset --
which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate
that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance
comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly
fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear
and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.

Conclusion: Karma通过融合领域知识与数据驱动方法，实现了更准确、可靠且可解释的电池健康预测，适用于多样化应用场景中的安全电池管理。

Abstract: Battery health prognostics are critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and
sustainability in modern energy systems. However, it has been challenging to
achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation
behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing
data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack
knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with
frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining
useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive
battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning
architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency
degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics.
Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is
modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our
dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with
particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and
uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior
performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over
state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream
datasets, respectively. These results highlight Karma's robustness,
generalizability, and potential for safer and more reliable battery management
across diverse applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to improving reasoning in large

Reinforcement Learning (TTRL) removes this need by using majority-vote rewards,
but relies on heavy online RL and incurs substantial computational cost. We
propose RoiRL: Reasoning with offline iterative Reinforcement Learning, a
family of lightweight offline learning alternatives that can target the same
regularized optimal policies. Unlike TTRL, RoiRL eliminates the need to
maintain a reference model and instead optimizes weighted log-likelihood
objectives, enabling stable training with significantly lower memory and
compute requirements. Experimental results show that RoiRL trains to 2.5x
faster and consistently outperforms TTRL on reasoning benchmarks, establishing
a scalable path to self-improving LLMs without labels.

autoregressive models that generate tokens left-to-right, dLLMs can finalize
tokens in arbitrary order, breaking the causal design underlying traditional
watermarks. We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed
specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to
restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted
tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits
both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and
predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize
detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves
92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text
quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods.
DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing
that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型计算昂贵、多阶段训练，且无法显式发现基因互作，制约了细胞分化建模的效率与生物学解释性。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，用局部线性化ODE表示细胞演化过程，端到端训练，仅需PCA预处理。

Result: 在单细胞基准上表现优异，扩展至大规模和多数据集训练时超越现有方法，并学习到与TRRUST数据库一致的可解释基因互作。

Conclusion: Cell-MNN为细胞分化建模提供了高效、可解释且可扩展的新框架，兼具计算优势与生物学意义。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of cellular differentiation is fundamental to advancing
the understanding and treatment of diseases associated with this process, such
as cancer. With the rapid growth of single-cell datasets, this has also become
a particularly promising and active domain for machine learning. Current
state-of-the-art models, however, rely on computationally expensive optimal
transport preprocessing and multi-stage training, while also not discovering
explicit gene interactions. To address these challenges we propose
Cell-Mechanistic Neural Networks (Cell-MNN), an encoder-decoder architecture
whose latent representation is a locally linearized ODE governing the dynamics
of cellular evolution from stem to tissue cells. Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end
(besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly
learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions.
Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on
single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to
larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also
learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST
database of gene interactions.

Method: 集成动态boosting机制与自适应梯度聚合，基于SAMME权重机制赋予低误差客户端更高权重，并通过调整焦散损失参数提升弱势客户端训练效果

Result: 在MNIST、FEMNIST和CIFAR10上验证，FeDABoost相比FedAvg和Ditto在公平性与性能上均有提升

Conclusion: FeDABoost有效平衡了联邦学习中的性能与公平性，为非IID场景提供新解决方案

Abstract: This work focuses on improving the performance and fairness of Federated
Learning (FL) in non IID settings by enhancing model aggregation and boosting
the training of underperforming clients. We propose FeDABoost, a novel FL
framework that integrates a dynamic boosting mechanism and an adaptive gradient
aggregation strategy. Inspired by the weighting mechanism of the Multiclass
AdaBoost (SAMME) algorithm, our aggregation method assigns higher weights to
clients with lower local error rates, thereby promoting more reliable
contributions to the global model. In parallel, FeDABoost dynamically boosts
underperforming clients by adjusting the focal loss focusing parameter,
emphasizing hard to classify examples during local training. We have evaluated
FeDABoost on three benchmark datasets MNIST, FEMNIST, and CIFAR10, and compared
its performance with those of FedAvg and Ditto. The results show that FeDABoost
achieves improved fairness and competitive performance.

Result: 在四个医疗中心的iEEG数据上实现竞争性分类性能，提升可解释性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床可变长时间序列分类提供了可靠且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical time series analysis is challenging due to data sparsity, noise, and
highly variable recording lengths. Prior work has shown that stochastic sparse
sampling effectively handles variable-length signals, while retrieval-augmented
approaches improve explainability and robustness to noise and weak temporal
correlations. In this study, we generalize the stochastic sparse sampling
framework for retrieval-informed classification. Specifically, we weight window
predictions by within-channel similarity and aggregate them in probability
space, yielding convex series-level scores and an explicit evidence trail for
explainability. Our method achieves competitive iEEG classification performance
and provides practitioners with greater transparency and explainability. We
evaluate our method in iEEG recordings collected in four medical centers,
demonstrating its potential for reliable and explainable clinical
variable-length time series classification.

Motivation: 现实部署中常缺乏标签测试数据，传统评估方法受限，亟需无监督的模型泛化评估方法。

Method: 利用模型预测的置信度与分散性（dispersity）两个内在属性，构建混合评估指标，并广泛基准测试各类指标在多种模型、数据集和分布偏移下的表现。

Conclusion: 置信度与分散性结合是无监督模型评估的有效途径，核范数指标可作为通用、实用的部署评估标准。

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for
real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This
paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model
evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the
accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric
evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled
test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic
properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction
certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes),
together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We
systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and
hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and
distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently
outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric
evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix
provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world
datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These
findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model
assessment in deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: 遍历风险度量为持续强化学习提供了首个风险感知的理论框架，填补了该领域空白。

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (continual RL) seeks to formalize the
notions of lifelong learning and endless adaptation in RL. In particular, the
aim of continual RL is to develop RL agents that can maintain a careful balance
between retaining useful information and adapting to new situations. To date,
continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of
risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected
(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal
theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware
decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of
long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical
theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in
non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the
continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure
theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk
measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a
case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results,
which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk
measures.

ContextFlow integrates local tissue organization and ligand-receptor
communication patterns into a transition plausibility matrix that regularizes
the optimal transport objective. By embedding these contextual constraints,
ContextFlow generates trajectories that are not only statistically consistent
but also biologically meaningful, making it a generalizable framework for

data. Evaluated on three datasets, ContextFlow consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art flow matching methods across multiple quantitative and

Motivation: 船舶轴功率预测对节能至关重要，但高质量传感器数据难以获取，中午报告作为替代数据源具有可行性

Method: 提出基于迁移学习的方法：先在高频数据上预训练模型，再用其他船舶的低频中午报告进行微调

Conclusion: 迁移学习能有效利用有限的低频数据提升轴功率预测性能，尤其在结构相似船舶上效果更佳

Abstract: With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has
become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft
power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and
directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount
step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated
with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as
weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can
improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is
often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a
viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for
predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on
high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily
noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels
(identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger
with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and
configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error
decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel,
and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on
noon report data.

Abstract: The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of
psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders
from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic
models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias
through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate
without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant
challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support
diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this
study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework
named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to
identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during
model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model
against nine established brain network classification methods across three
multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior
diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore,
the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical
biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the
visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This
alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance
for real-world diagnostic applications.

Result: 在合成基准、神经行为数据和MuJoCo任务中，恢复了更具表现力的奖励表示，并实现最优模仿学习性能

Conclusion: 该方法适合行为分析与风险感知模仿学习，显著提升了奖励建模与策略学习的质量

Abstract: We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full
distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a
deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method
captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the
reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD)
violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy
learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and
distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior
analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic
benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks
demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and
achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.

Conclusion: DMIS是首个系统性解决扩散模型中不精确监督问题的统一框架，显著提升模型鲁棒性与生成性能。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various
generative tasks recently, but their training typically relies on large-scale
datasets that inevitably contain imprecise information in conditional inputs.
Such supervision, often stemming from noisy, ambiguous, or incomplete labels,
will cause condition mismatch and degrade generation quality. To address this
challenge, we propose DMIS, a unified framework for training robust Diffusion
Models from Imprecise Supervision, which is the first systematic study within
diffusion models. Our framework is derived from likelihood maximization and
decomposes the objective into generative and classification components: the
generative component models imprecise-label distributions, while the
classification component leverages a diffusion classifier to infer
class-posterior probabilities, with its efficiency further improved by an
optimized timestep sampling strategy. Extensive experiments on diverse forms of
imprecise supervision, covering tasks of image generation, weakly supervised
learning, and noisy dataset condensation demonstrate that DMIS consistently
produces high-quality and class-discriminative samples.

Abstract: The Wasserstein barycenter is defined as the mean of a set of probability
measures under the optimal transport metric, and has numerous applications
spanning machine learning, statistics, and computer graphics. In practice these
input measures are empirical distributions built from sensitive datasets,
motivating a differentially private (DP) treatment. We present, to our
knowledge, the first algorithms for computing Wasserstein barycenters under

U.S. population datasets, our methods produce high-quality private barycenters
with strong accuracy-privacy tradeoffs.

Conclusion: 平衡符号图上的谱去噪方法为EEG分类提供高效、可解释的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Samples of brain signals collected by EEG sensors have inherent
anti-correlations that are well modeled by negative edges in a finite graph. To
differentiate epilepsy patients from healthy subjects using collected EEG
signals, we build lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural nets by
unrolling a spectral denoising algorithm for signals on a balanced signed graph
-- graph with no cycles of odd number of negative edges. A balanced signed
graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph
via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal
low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos
approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data. Given
that two balanced signed graph denoisers learn posterior probabilities of two
different signal classes during training, we evaluate their reconstruction
errors for binary classification of EEG signals. Experiments show that our
method achieves classification performance comparable to representative deep
learning schemes, while employing dramatically fewer parameters.

Conclusion: CHORD实现了个性化与资源适应的平衡，无需重新训练即可高效部署于异构设备

Abstract: With the advancement of mobile device capabilities, deploying reranking
models directly on devices has become feasible, enabling real-time contextual
recommendations. When migrating models from cloud to devices, resource
heterogeneity inevitably necessitates model compression. Recent quantization
methods show promise for efficient deployment, yet they overlook
device-specific user interests, resulting in compromised recommendation
accuracy. While on-device finetuning captures personalized user preference, it
imposes additional computational burden through local retraining. To address
these challenges, we propose a framework for \underline{\textbf{C}}ustomizing
\underline{\textbf{H}}ybrid-precision \underline{\textbf{O}}n-device model for
sequential \underline{\textbf{R}}ecommendation with
\underline{\textbf{D}}evice-cloud collaboration (\textbf{CHORD}), leveraging
channel-wise mixed-precision quantization to simultaneously achieve
personalization and resource-adaptive deployment. CHORD distributes randomly
initialized models across heterogeneous devices and identifies user-specific
critical parameters through auxiliary hypernetwork modules on the cloud. Our
parameter sensitivity analysis operates across multiple granularities (layer,
filter, and element levels), enabling precise mapping from user profiles to
quantization strategy. Through on-device mixed-precision quantization, CHORD
delivers dynamic model adaptation and accelerated inference without
backpropagation, eliminating costly retraining cycles. We minimize
communication overhead by encoding quantization strategies using only 2 bits
per channel instead of 32-bit weights. Experiments on three real-world datasets
with two popular backbones (SASRec and Caser) demonstrate the accuracy,
efficiency, and adaptivity of CHORD.

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become essential for large-scale
atomistic simulations, enabling ab initio-level accuracy with computational
efficiency. However, current MLPs struggle with uncertainty quantification,
limiting their reliability for active learning, calibration, and
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We address these challenges by developing
Bayesian E(3) equivariant MLPs with iterative restratification of many-body
message passing. Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative
log-likelihood (NLL$_\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models
uncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy
compared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple
Bayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,
stochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and
laplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty
prediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further
demonstrate that NLL$_\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by
quantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by
disagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and
energy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs
achieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling
uncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces
calibration. This work establishes Bayesian equivariant neural networks as a
powerful framework for developing uncertainty-aware MLPs for atomistic
simulations at scale.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions
requires extreme sample efficiency. While Bayesian optimization (BO) is the
current state-of-the-art, its performance hinges on surrogate and acquisition
function hyper-parameters that are often hand-tuned and fail to generalize
across problem landscapes. We present ZeroShotOpt, a general-purpose,
pretrained model for continuous black-box optimization tasks ranging from 2D to
20D. Our approach leverages offline reinforcement learning on large-scale
optimization trajectories collected from 12 BO variants. To scale pretraining,
we generate millions of synthetic Gaussian process-based functions with diverse
landscapes, enabling the model to learn transferable optimization policies. As
a result, ZeroShotOpt achieves robust zero-shot generalization on a wide array
of unseen benchmarks, matching or surpassing the sample efficiency of leading
global optimizers, including BO, while also offering a reusable foundation for
future extensions and improvements. Our open-source code, dataset, and model

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维参数化动作空间中强化学习算法效率与稳定性不足的问题，避免使用循环网络。

Method: 在Platform-v0和Goal-v0基准上测试SAC、GAC和TQC的变体，使用Microsoft NNI进行超参数优化，改进GAC和TQC代码以确保可复现性。

Result: PAGAC在两项任务中均实现最快训练速度和最高回报，Platform任务耗时41:24，Goal任务耗时24:04，显著优于PASAC和PATQC。

Abstract: This study evaluates the performance of Soft Actor Critic (SAC), Greedy Actor
Critic (GAC), and Truncated Quantile Critics (TQC) in high-dimensional
decision-making tasks using fully observable environments. The focus is on
parametrized action (PA) spaces, eliminating the need for recurrent networks,
with benchmarks Platform-v0 and Goal-v0 testing discrete actions linked to
continuous action-parameter spaces. Hyperparameter optimization was performed
with Microsoft NNI, ensuring reproducibility by modifying the codebase for GAC
and TQC. Results show that Parameterized Action Greedy Actor-Critic (PAGAC)
outperformed other algorithms, achieving the fastest training times and highest
returns across benchmarks, completing 5,000 episodes in 41:24 for the Platform
game and 24:04 for the Robot Soccer Goal game. Its speed and stability provide
clear advantages in complex action spaces. Compared to PASAC and PATQC, PAGAC
demonstrated superior efficiency and reliability, making it ideal for tasks
requiring rapid convergence and robust performance. Future work could explore
hybrid strategies combining entropy-regularization with truncation-based
methods to enhance stability and expand investigations into generalizability.

*Mingfeng Fan,Jiaqi Cheng,Yaoxin Wu,Yifeng Zhang,Yibin Yang,Guohua Wu,Guillaume Sartoretti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出UD3RL框架解决近邻旅行商问题(CETSP)，通过双解码器结构提升全局与局部决策性能，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法主要关注标准TSP，而CETSP因邻域访问机制复杂，缺乏有效解决方案。

Method: 构建离散化MDP模型，提出UD3RL框架，包含自适应编码器、节点解码器与位置解码器，并引入k近邻子图交互策略，定制REINFORCE算法进行训练。

Result: UD3RL在解的质量和运行时间上超越传统方法，且在不同规模、空间分布、邻域半径及动态环境中表现出强泛化性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UD3RL为CETSP提供了高效且通用的深度强化学习解决方案，推动了邻域型路径规划问题的研究进展。

Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has gained traction for
solving the NP-hard traveling salesman problem (TSP). However, limited
attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the
challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a
node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around
it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using
a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL)
framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint
determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective
feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the
two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction
strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location
decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a
unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and
varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii).
Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both
solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across
problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness
to dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 通过链式GNN迭代优化图对齐相似矩阵，显著超越传统方法和现有GNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在组合优化问题上表现不佳，尤其在图对齐这一NP难问题上缺乏有效解法。

Method: 提出链式GNN框架，逐层迭代 refine 相似矩阵，采用节点对架构捕获全局结构信息，结合离散排名反馈提升对齐质量。

Result: 在合成基准上准确率提升3倍以上，首次成功解决正则图对齐，结合传统优化后超越SOTA求解器。

Conclusion: 链式GNN通过迭代优化和结构感知，为图对齐问题提供了高效且鲁棒的新范式。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have struggled to outperform traditional
optimization methods on combinatorial problems, limiting their practical
impact. We address this gap by introducing a novel chaining procedure for the
graph alignment problem, a fundamental NP-hard task of finding optimal node
correspondences between unlabeled graphs using only structural information. Our
method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively
refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference,
this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by
incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from
prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on
node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns
essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot
represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than
existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs
where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional
optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.

TL;DR: 通过分数蒸馏技术显著加速蛋白质主链生成，实现20倍以上采样速度提升，同时保持与原模型相当的设计性、多样性和新颖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在蛋白质主链生成中采样步骤过多，计算效率低，限制了大规模蛋白发现的应用。

Method: 将先进的分数蒸馏策略SiD适配于蛋白质生成，结合多步生成与推理时噪声调制技术，训练少步生成器。

Result: 采样速度提升20倍以上，设计性、多样性与新颖性与原模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低推理成本，推动扩散模型在真实蛋白质工程中的实用化。

Abstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong
performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented
capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable
performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating
speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion
process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in
large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate
structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of
score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of
sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality.
However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably
low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to
appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score
distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which
significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to
their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined
with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that
our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in
sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and
novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables
large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models
closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

TL;DR: 提出一种在训练中自适应选择图神经网络节点特征的方法，通过置换特征值评估其重要性，动态移除无用特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图数据中节点特征与结构存在复杂依赖，传统特征重要性度量方法不适用，需一种模型与任务无关的方法来识别关键特征。

Method: 基于训练过程中对验证性能的干预（置换特征值）评估特征重要性，动态淘汰无用特征，并追踪重要性变化过程。

Result: 方法适用于多种图架构与复杂图学习场景，能有效降低维度并提升性能，同时提供特征重要性演化追踪。

Conclusion: 该方法为图神经网络提供了一种灵活、可解释的自适应特征选择机制，兼具理论依据与实证有效性。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive node feature selection approach for graph neural
networks (GNNs) that identifies and removes unnecessary features during
training. The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key
for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving
performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data
introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature
importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and
task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on
changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We
theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how
GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph
structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training
concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively
dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and
also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify
the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its
adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaBet是一种无需梯度和标签的层选择方法，通过拓扑特征提升边缘设备上的模型自适应性能，准确率提升5%且内存消耗降低40%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上进行模型自适应面临计算与内存受限的问题，传统微调方法因深度网络和梯度计算开销过大而不实用

Method: 提出AdaBet，通过激活空间的Betti数分析拓扑特征，仅用前向传播评估层的重要性，实现无梯度、无标签的层选择

Result: 在16组基准模型和数据集上验证，AdaBet平均比梯度基方法准确率高5%，峰值内存降低40%

Conclusion: AdaBet为边缘设备提供高效、低资源开销的模型自适应方案，无需标签或梯度，实用性强

Abstract: To utilize pre-trained neural networks on edge and mobile devices, we often
require efficient adaptation to user-specific runtime data distributions while
operating under limited compute and memory resources. On-device retraining with
a target dataset can facilitate such adaptations; however, it remains
impractical due to the increasing depth of modern neural nets, as well as the
computational overhead associated with gradient-based optimization across all
layers. Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers
for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model
backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for
constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection
approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their
activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet
allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for
retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating
AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves
an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based
baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.

Result: 在大规模实际地铁数据上验证，模型能准确预测时刻间隔，计算效率高，优于传统仿真方法。

Conclusion: 所提框架为地铁运营商提供高效、可操作的实时调度工具，显著提升服务稳定性和乘客满意度。

Abstract: Efficient real-time dispatching in urban metro systems is essential for
ensuring service reliability, maximizing resource utilization, and improving
passenger satisfaction. This study presents a novel deep learning framework
centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to
predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an
entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a
critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately
forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal
evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability
empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control
decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We
introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies,
ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived
from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily
focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our
approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale
dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates
promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time
decision-making. This framework provides rail operators with a powerful,
computationally efficient tool to optimize dispatching strategies, thereby
significantly improving service consistency and passenger satisfaction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习预测器因目标不匹配和误差放大在稳健资产配置中表现不佳，亟需端到端优化风险感知目标的新方法。

Method: SIT利用路径签名捕捉资产动态的几何特征，并通过签名增强的注意力机制融入领先-滞后效应等金融先验偏置，实现端到端投资策略学习。

Result: 在标普100日频数据上，SIT显著优于传统与深度学习基线，尤其超越预测-后优化模型。

Conclusion: 风险感知目标与几何感知先验偏置对机器学习系统中的风险资本配置至关重要。

Abstract: Robust asset allocation is a key challenge in quantitative finance, where
deep-learning forecasters often fail due to objective mismatch and error
amplification. We introduce the Signature-Informed Transformer (SIT), a novel
framework that learns end-to-end allocation policies by directly optimizing a
risk-aware financial objective. SIT's core innovations include path signatures
for a rich geometric representation of asset dynamics and a signature-augmented
attention mechanism embedding financial inductive biases, like lead-lag
effects, into the model. Evaluated on daily S\&P 100 equity data, SIT
decisively outperforms traditional and deep-learning baselines, especially when
compared to predict-then-optimize models. These results indicate that
portfolio-aware objectives and geometry-aware inductive biases are essential
for risk-aware capital allocation in machine-learning systems. The code is

Conclusion: 所提管道显著提升反事实解释的实用性与可解释性，适用于真实场景部署。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence has become a crucial area of research,
aiming to demystify the decision-making processes of deep learning models.
Among various explainability techniques, counterfactual explanations have been
proven particularly promising, as they offer insights into model behavior by
highlighting minimal changes that would alter a prediction. Despite their
potential, these explanations are often complex and technical, making them
difficult for non-experts to interpret. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages Language Models, large and small, to compose
narratives for counterfactual explanations. We employ knowledge distillation
techniques along with a refining mechanism to enable Small Language Models to
perform comparably to their larger counterparts while maintaining robust
reasoning abilities. In addition, we introduce a simple but effective
evaluation method to assess natural language narratives, designed to verify
whether the models' responses are in line with the factual, counterfactual
ground truth. As a result, our proposed pipeline enhances both the reasoning
capabilities and practical performance of student models, making them more
suitable for real-world use cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于过程验证器的生成方法因验证器微小错误易导致灾难性累积，需更鲁棒的解码策略。

Method: VGB算法将自回归生成建模为树上的随机游走，基于验证器与基础模型指导转移概率，并引入概率性回溯机制，理论源于Sinclair-Jerrum随机游走。

Result: 在合成与真实语言建模任务中，VGB在多种指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过借鉴理论计算机科学中的随机游走理论，VGB为过程引导生成提供了更稳健、可证明的解码框架。

Abstract: Test-time algorithms that combine the generative power of language models
with process verifiers that assess the quality of partial generations offer a
promising lever for eliciting new reasoning capabilities, but the algorithmic
design space and computational scaling properties of such approaches are still
opaque, and their benefits are far from apparent when one accounts for the cost
of learning a high-quality verifier. Our starting point is the observation that
seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures
for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course
of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated
decoding strategies?
  We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which
uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness
to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk
on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the
process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs
probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random
walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and
sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our
work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we
demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB
outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.

Motivation: 通过高率量化理论理解MoE模型在回归任务中的逼近误差特性，探索专家数量对模型性能的理论影响。

Method: 将输入空间分割为小区域，每个区域由常数预测专家处理；对一维与多维输入分别推导测试误差及其最优分割，分析专家参数的统计学习性质。

Result: 推导出一维下的最优分割与误差表达式，给出多维下的误差上界，并理论与实验验证逼近误差与估计误差随专家数量变化的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 专家数量增加可降低逼近误差但增加估计误差，MoE性能存在最优平衡点，高率量化理论为MoE设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper uses classical high-rate quantization theory to provide new
insights into mixture-of-experts (MoE) models for regression tasks. Our MoE is
defined by a segmentation of the input space to regions, each with a
single-parameter expert that acts as a constant predictor with zero-compute at
inference. Motivated by high-rate quantization theory assumptions, we assume
that the number of experts is sufficiently large to make their input-space
regions very small. This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE
model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and
its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we
formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization.
Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training
dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical
learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how
the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning
depends on the number of experts.

Conclusion: 通过直接优化校准误差，可以有效提升主动学习的模型性能，为高可靠性预测提供新思路。

Abstract: We study the problem of actively learning a classifier with a low calibration
error. One of the most popular Acquisition Functions (AFs) in pool-based Active
Learning (AL) is querying by the model's uncertainty. However, we recognize
that an uncalibrated uncertainty model on the unlabeled pool may significantly
affect the AF effectiveness, leading to sub-optimal generalization and high
calibration error on unseen data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even
worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we
propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the
highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we
utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and
formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration
error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data. Empirically, our proposed
method surpasses other AF baselines by having a lower calibration and
generalization error across pool-based AL settings.

Motivation: 尽管学习率预热在现代深度学习中广泛使用，但其理论基础仍不清晰。

Result: 证明了预热调度比固定学习率收敛更快，且该条件在常见网络与损失函数下成立。

Conclusion: 理论分析与实验共同证实了学习率预热的必要性与实用性。

Abstract: Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of
training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its
theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a
principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a
generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local
curvature as a linear function of the loss sub-optimality and exhibits
desirable closure properties. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically
that this condition holds for common neural architectures trained with
mean-squared error and cross-entropy losses. Under this assumption, we prove
that Gradient Descent with a warm-up schedule achieves faster convergence than
with a fixed step-size, establishing upper and lower complexity bounds.
Finally, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments on language
and vision models, confirming the practical benefits of warm-up schedules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统同步和异步联邦学习在资源受限的边缘设备上面临内存、能耗、带宽限制，以及异构网络中的慢节点延迟和收敛慢问题。

Method: FTTE采用稀疏参数更新和基于更新年龄与方差的滞留加权聚合机制，实现高效的半异步联邦训练。

Result: FTTE比同步FL（如FedAVG）收敛速度快81%，设备内存降低80%，通信负载减少69%，并在高异构场景下达到与半异步方法相当或更高的精度。

Conclusion: FTTE是首个适用于真实世界异构、资源受限边缘设备的实用且可扩展的联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed devices while preserving data privacy, but deployment on
resource-constrained edge nodes remains challenging due to limited memory,
energy, and communication bandwidth. Traditional synchronous and asynchronous
FL approaches further suffer from straggler induced delays and slow convergence
in heterogeneous, large scale networks. We present FTTE (Federated Tiny
Training Engine),a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework that uniquely employs
sparse parameter updates and a staleness-weighted aggregation based on both age
and variance of client updates. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
data distributions - including up to 500 clients and 90% stragglers -
demonstrate that FTTE not only achieves 81% faster convergence, 80% lower
on-device memory usage, and 69% communication payload reduction than
synchronous FL (eg.FedAVG), but also consistently reaches comparable or higher
target accuracy than semi-asynchronous (eg.FedBuff) in challenging regimes.
These results establish FTTE as the first practical and scalable solution for
real-world FL deployments on heterogeneous and predominantly
resource-constrained edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QUCB算法在非平稳RL环境中，因分布漂移导致策略在漂移后陷入次优奖励，亟需一种能感知漂移并自适应调整的算法。

Method: 提出Density-QUCB（DQUCB），利用转移密度函数检测分布漂移，并将其似然值融入Q值的不确定性估计，增强探索能力。

Result: 理论证明DQUCB相比QUCB具有更优的后悔界；实验表明其在标准RL任务和COVID-19医院分配任务中均显著降低后悔值，且保持模型自由算法的计算效率。

Conclusion: DQUCB是一种有效应对非平稳环境分布漂移的轻量级、高效算法，成功平衡探索与利用，为实际动态系统提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution
shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions
may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting,
such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction
with the environment. While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm
(QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution
shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To
address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware
Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect
distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty
estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between
exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB
achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB. Empirically, our DQUCB enjoys the
computational efficiency of model-free RL and outperforms QUCB baselines by
having a lower regret across RL tasks, as well as a real-world COVID-19 patient
hospital allocation task using a Deep-Q-learning architecture.

Abstract: Benchmarks for competition-style reasoning have advanced evaluation in
mathematics and programming, yet physics remains comparatively explored. Most
existing physics benchmarks evaluate only final answers, which fail to capture
reasoning processes, while recent stepwise methods rely on heuristic
LLM-as-judge scoring or restrictive linear assumptions, limiting reliability
and diagnostic validity. We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation
framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are
represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding
causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of
the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a
fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we
developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without
heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned
with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal
persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both
diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training. By combining structural
rigor, theoretical guarantees, and symbolic validation, PRISM-Physics provides
a principled foundation for advancing process-level evaluation and guiding the
development of models with deeper scientific reasoning capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究超线性表示是否干扰表征对齐度量，导致低估神经网络或脑区之间的实际对齐程度。

Method: 构建理论分析严格排列度量与超线性表示的关系，并通过训练稀疏自编码器（SAEs）解缠超线性表示，比较解缠前后对齐分数变化。

Result: 解缠超线性表示后，toy模型、DNN→DNN和DNN→脑的线性回归对齐分数显著提升。

Conclusion: 超线性表示会扭曲对齐度量，必须先进行解缠才能准确评估神经表征的真实对齐性。

Abstract: The superposition hypothesis states that a single neuron within a population
may participate in the representation of multiple features in order for the
population to represent more features than the number of neurons. In
neuroscience and AI, representational alignment metrics measure the extent to
which different deep neural networks (DNNs) or brains represent similar
information. In this work, we explore a critical question: \textit{does
superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We
hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \textit{different
superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear
combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics
(semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment
than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics
are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment
scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced
with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for
DNN\(\rightarrow\)DNN and DNN\(\rightarrow\)brain linear regression alignment
in the visual domain. Our results suggest that superposition disentanglement is
necessary for mapping metrics to uncover the true representational alignment
between neural codes.

TL;DR: 使用可穿戴传感器和机器学习估算肱二头肌弯举的主观疲劳度（RPE），随机森林模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计RPE可提升抗阻训练的个性化反馈与伤痛预防。

Method: 采集69组超1000次重复的惯性与EMG传感器数据，提取统计特征，训练多种机器学习模型进行RPE估算。

Result: 随机森林模型达到41.4%精确准确率和85.9%±1 RPE准确率，EMG略有提升但受限于数据质量，离心阶段时长为最强预测特征。

Conclusion: 基于可穿戴传感器的RPE估算可行，但模型泛化能力仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of rating of perceived exertion (RPE) can enhance
resistance training through personalized feedback and injury prevention. This
study investigates the application of machine learning models to estimate RPE
during single-arm dumbbell bicep curls, using data from wearable inertial and
electromyography (EMG) sensors. A custom dataset of 69 sets and over 1000
repetitions was collected, with statistical features extracted for model
training. Among the models evaluated, a random forest classifier achieved the
highest performance, with 41.4% exact accuracy and 85.9% $\pm1$ RPE accuracy.
While the inclusion of EMG data slightly improved model accuracy over inertial
sensors alone, its utility may have been limited by factors such as data
quality and placement sensitivity. Feature analysis highlighted eccentric
repetition time as the strongest RPE predictor. The results demonstrate the
feasibility of wearable-sensor-based RPE estimation and identify key challenges
for improving model generalizability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的推理策略Best-of-Majority（BoM），在Pass@k设置下优于多数投票和Best-of-N，具有最优 regret 保证且不随采样预算增加而性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多数投票和Best-of-N在困难任务中扩展性差，无法有效利用增加的采样预算，Pass@k评估下性能受限。

Method: 提出BoM策略：先从N个采样中筛选高频响应，再从中选出Top-k奖励最高的响应，结合了多数投票与BoN的优点。

Result: 理论上证明BoM的regret为$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$，且达到最小最大最优；实验表明在数学问题上性能优于传统方法。

Conclusion: BoM是Pass@k设置下更优的推理策略，兼具理论最优性和实践有效性，解决了采样预算增加时性能退化的问题。

Abstract: LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects
one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult
tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently,
evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,
and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we
study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and
prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with
$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting
and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),
with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high
frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove
that when the sampling budget is $N=\tilde\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is
$O(\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}+\sqrt{\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$
is the coverage coefficient, $\epsilon_{\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error
of the reward model, and $\epsilon_{\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of
reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,
certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a
key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade
when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show
BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.

Conclusion: 研究为如何有效利用特权信息提供新指南，有望提升多种部分可观测场景中策略学习的效率。

Abstract: Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning
(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent
empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages
availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a
simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to
disentangle the task of "learning to see" from "learning to act". While expert
distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state
information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through
a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and
controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we
investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation
and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The
trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as
theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief
contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is
not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new
guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially
advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially
observable domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出低概率正则化（Lp-Reg），通过保护推理火花（reasoning sparks）解决强化学习中探索崩溃问题，显著提升大语言模型在数学推理任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法过度依赖提升策略熵来维持探索，却忽视了有价值但低概率的推理火花被系统性剔除的问题，导致探索退化和训练不稳定。

Method: 提出Lp-Reg，通过过滤噪声词元并重归一化构建启发式代理分布，以KL散度正则化策略，放大并保护推理火花的出现概率。

Result: Lp-Reg实现约1000步的稳定策略训练，超越基线熵控制方法，在五个数学基准上达到60.17%平均准确率，提升2.66%。

Conclusion: 推理火花是关键探索成分，其保护比单纯提升熵更有效；Lp-Reg为RLVR提供了更精准的探索调控范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large
Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by
a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses,
signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by
maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern
meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that
an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and
destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within
RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable
low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning
sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are
systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a
degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability
Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a
heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out
presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining
candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of
\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft
regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL
divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for
around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.
This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a
$60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$
over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.
