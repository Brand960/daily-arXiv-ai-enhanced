While prior work has explored data poisoning during\nstatic pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual\npre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory\ntruth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods\nincreases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar\nvulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but\nconfidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from\nthe truth.\n  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief\ndynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of\npoisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,\nmodel scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs\nshift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent\nrepresentational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying\nacross layers and model sizes.

We introduce NaviTrace, a high-quality\nVisual Question Answering benchmark where a model receives an instruction and\nembodiment type (human, legged robot, wheeled robot, bicycle) and must output a\n2D navigation trace in image space. Across 1000 scenarios and more than 3000\nexpert traces, we systematically evaluate eight state-of-the-art VLMs using a\nnewly introduced semantic-aware trace score. This metric combines Dynamic Time\nWarping distance, goal endpoint error, and embodiment-conditioned penalties\nderived from per-pixel semantics and correlates with human preferences.

To address this, we propose\nFairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy\ndesigned for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level\ndemographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a\nclustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while\nenforcing census-derived group proportions.

We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier\nthat unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans\nare linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an\noff-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds\neach plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a\nlow-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for\nunseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.\n  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the\nlikelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.\nThis guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving\nrule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV\nimproves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline\nmethods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement\nframework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning\ndomains.

Because this approach requires an enclosed\nmechanism for transporting sensors, we developed, modeled, and tested a\npassively adapting enclosed tip mount. Finally, we validated the hermetic and\ntransparent vine robot system concept through a real-world condition assessment\nand mapping task in a wastewater pipe.

Our key contribution is\na hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child\nrelationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook\nenables the network to automatically identify common substructures across\npotentially diverse shape categories.

Conventional\ngrippers often rely on applying high normal forces, which can cause damage to\nobjects. To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that\ncombines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The\ngripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the\ninternal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental\nexperiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a\nproportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables\nthe gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the\ngripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,\nfruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than\napplying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid\ngripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative\nto relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper\nflexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u521a\u6027\u5916\u58f3\u4e0e\u53ef\u5145\u6c14\u7845\u80f6\u56ca\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5939\u722a\u6307\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u6c14\u538b\u6539\u53d8\u8868\u9762\u6469\u64e6\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6293\u53d6\u591a\u79cd\u7269\u4f53\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u589e\u5927\u5939\u6301\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5939\u722a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u6cd5\u5411\u529b\u6293\u53d6\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u6613\u635f\u574f\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u5149\u6ed1\u6216\u91cd\u7269\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u5939\u722a\u6307\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u521a\u6027\u5916\u58f3\u4e0e\u53ef\u5145\u6c14\u7845\u80f6\u56ca\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6c14\u538b\u8c03\u8282\u8868\u9762\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6c14\u538b\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u63d0\u5347\u6469\u64e6\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u6293\u53d6\u91cd\u7269\u548c\u6ed1\u7269\uff0c\u5e76\u5b8c\u597d\u6293\u53d6\u9e21\u86cb\u3001\u6c34\u679c\u3001\u7eb8\u676f\u7b49\u6613\u635f\u7269\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u6469\u64e6\u800c\u975e\u589e\u5927\u5939\u6301\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While most\nrecent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing\n3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for\nmany real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and\nforest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of\na comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over\nreal-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have\nbuilt a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM\nin wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric\nDreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect\naerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of\nadditional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also\nprovides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and\ntypes and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks\ncovering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting\npilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images\nfrom a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of\nWildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals\nthe unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights\npotential improvements for future works.

Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of\nquery objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain\nspatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object\nlocations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer\ninformation between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship\nfeature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge\nnoise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),\nwhich performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,\nenabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the\nquery object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of\ncross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the\nquery object.

Criticality metrics provide an\nobjective means of assessing safety. However, as existing metrics primarily\ntarget longitudinal conflicts, accurately quantifying the risks of lateral\nconflicts - prevalent in urban settings - remains challenging. This paper\nproposes the Modified-Emergency Index (MEI), a metric designed to quantify\nevasive effort in lateral conflicts. Compared to the original Emergency Index\n(EI), MEI refines the estimation of the time available for evasive maneuvers,\nenabling more precise risk quantification. We validate MEI on a public lateral\nconflict dataset based on Argoverse-2, from which we extract over 1,500\nhigh-quality AV conflict cases, including more than 500 critical events.

Instead of\nteaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim\nto teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like\nadding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance\nin two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented\nConsistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al.

The\nLLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key\nobjects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly\ndetected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,\nregion-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated.

Fusing the\nthese complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D\nperception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to\nsingle-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete\nscene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,\nhinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers\nricher spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust\nand effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and\nmitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.\nConsequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object\ndetection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal\ndata from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate\nfeatures from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce\nreference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer\ninformation for second-stage.

Besides static images, more and more research attentions have\nbeen drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only\nhas a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in\nensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,\nhuman-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to\ngenerate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via\nCondition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic\nsingle-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion\nmodel. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a\nvideo sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully\nbenefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance\nEnhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image\nduring the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering\nModule (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve\nthe generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video\ndata from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model\ntraining.

Spatial\nnormalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,\nbut often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when\nlocalization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted\nbrain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between\nindividuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)\nlearns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from\nmulti-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive\nobjectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to\nregion-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a\ntransformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of\nchannels.

While existing caching techniques can\naccelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed\nand fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold\nsystem, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure\nthe efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature\nsummarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity\nestimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods.

However, it remains\nchallenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences\nbecause of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,\nwe propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework\nthat handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across\ndiverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer\narchitecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still\nenabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent\nnoise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This\ndesign enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional\nmanner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the\ndecoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling\nmethod that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve\nasynchronously at different rates.

We also constructed the Hyper-400K\ndataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality\nbenchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS\nsensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding\nprocess for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to\ngenerate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each\nspectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own\nimage content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a\nsample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors\nfor channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction\nand latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to\nperceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and\nsensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable\nnumber of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint\npre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware\ncan learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic\nsegmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSpecAware\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5143\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u8d85\u5149\u8c31\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8054\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5730\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u7565\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5143\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1SpecAware\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5143\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u7f16\u7801\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u5149\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5730\u7269\u5206\u5272\u3001\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SpecAware\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u878d\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5143\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668HLSI\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper presents Object-IR, a\nself-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a\nlearning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is\nguided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.\nGiven an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid\nmesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict\nthe motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted\nresult is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in\nthe input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate\ngeometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function\nincorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic\nobjects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain\nsimple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce\na clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates\nthe need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision\ndirectly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive\nevaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative\nmetrics and subjective visual quality assessments.

Recent advances in the pathological\nfoundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving\nmeaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.\nHowever, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity\ncaused by diverse private training datasets and different network\narchitectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we\nutilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To\nfully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we\npropose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,\ncalled FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The\nmain contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To\nguarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a\nmulti-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via\nmultiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous\npatch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online\ncapture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous\nslide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the\nconnections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung\ncancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFuseCPath\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u75c5\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347WSI\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u75c5\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u5f02\u6784\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd", "method": "1) \u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u805a\u7c7b\u7b5b\u9009\u5224\u522b\u6027\u8865\u4e01\uff1b2) \u805a\u7c7b\u7ea7\u91cd\u5d4c\u5165\u878d\u5408\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3)\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u878d\u5408\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81", "result": "\u5728TCGA\u7684\u80ba\u764c\u3001\u8180\u80f1\u764c\u548c\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u764c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFuseCPath\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "FuseCPath\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u75c5\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387"}}

As a\nnovel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial\ntraining to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood\nof sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of\nadversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this\nwork, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of\nconcept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept\nspace? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual\nsemantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting\nof concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there\nare few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object\nconcept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.\nMotivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE\n(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging\nsemantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and\nperform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art\nmethods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM\nunlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure\nperformance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training\ntime by 90%.

We introduce an\nattention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D\nsmoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue\nreconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.\nExperimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate\nthat our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and\nLPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better\nvisualization quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSAGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u955c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53d8\u5f62\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6df7\u53e0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8fd0\u52a8\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6df7\u53e0\u4e0e\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u67434D\u53d8\u5f62\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u5e73\u6ed1\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4e0e2D Mip\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6df7\u53e0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728EndoNeRF\u548cSCARED\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSAGS\u5728PSNR\u3001SSIM\u3001LPIPS\u6240\u6709\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGS\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most training data attribution (TDA)\nmethods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often\nusing leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be\nattributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an\noperational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining\ncorpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a\nsimple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST\nembeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the\nnearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,\nwe consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2\nand report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much\nlonger spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote\nor suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also\nincreases novelty.

To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly\nfine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which\ninvolves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this\nissue, we propose a new method, called \\textbf{C}omplex \\textbf{I}mage\n\\textbf{E}diting via \\textbf{L}LM \\textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a\ncomplex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,\neliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and\ndiffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic\nrepresentation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce\nan iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this\nrepresentation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image\nscene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.\nExtensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our\nmethod surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating\nits superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the\nlimited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with\nreasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image\nsamples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.\nCIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark.

That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for\nreducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use\nelement-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of\nthe weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological\ndirections in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the\ncondition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon\noptimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize\nmatrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,\nLocal Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces\ncommunication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID\nsetting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions\nof each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses\nsignificant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)\nmoment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nFederated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)\nmomentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local\ninitialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are\naligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.\nTheoretically, we prove that \\texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup\nconvergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number\nof participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and\n$R$ is the total number of communication rounds.

First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed.

However, current CL-DPFL methods usually\nresult in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model\ngeneralization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find\na local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local\nflatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address\nthis issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL\nalgorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to\nthe local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global\ngradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also\nreduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error\nof gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN\nmitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed\nDP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves\nfast convergence. We also use R\\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees\nand provide sensitivity analysis for local updates.

Traditional preconditioners\nrely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while\nlimiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing\nlearning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve\nthe performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on\nincomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated\ntriangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces\nlong-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these\nissues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly\npreconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate\nInverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires\nonly two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector\nproduct is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The\nflexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of\nscenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss\nfunction. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on\nthe condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved\nperformance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived\ndatasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstandard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous\nlearning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by\n40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior\ngeneralization performance.

While Large Language Models\n(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance\nremains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based\napproaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high\ncomputational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a\ngraph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in\nformulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents\noptimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph\nisomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the\ntested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the\nWeisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.\nBuilding on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an\nSD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural\nequivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to\nnumerical variations.

Unlike traditional images\nor videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,\nas they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric\nattacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural\nwatermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership\nverification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of\n3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning\nusing PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to\nreliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such\nas rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our\nmethod using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep\nlearning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based\ntechniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly\noutperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise\naccuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD\nachieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,\nwhich is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment.

This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP).

In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive\nHard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the\npower of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to\nenable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings\nfor the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster\ntogether in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same\nclass while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps\nthe model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient\ncues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and\nrobust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard\nadversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial\nguidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more\nstructured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and\nrobustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faANCHOR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6e05\u6d01\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f9d\u8d56\u68af\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u5373\u53ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "ANCHOR\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u786c\u6b63\u4f8b\u6316\u6398\uff0c\u4f7f\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e0e\u540c\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f02\u7c7b\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\uff0cANCHOR\u5728PGD-20\uff08\u03b5=0.031\uff09\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6e05\u6d01\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0e\u786c\u6316\u6398\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when\napplied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize\nthat leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and\nbranching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To\ninvestigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating\nlarge-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in\nsegmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular\ngeometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,\nencouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures.

Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the\nmost commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a\nsimilarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of\ntheir sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent\nstudies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for\nmeasuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we\nhave observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which\nnegatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when\nused as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes\nleads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).\nThrough analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD\nnot only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,\nwhich enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the\nAI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box\nregression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various detectors.

However,\nlimited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex\ngenerative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video\ngeneration. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory\nusage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.\nWhile prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential\nsolution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of\nmulti-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step\ncounterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step\ndistillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model\ncapacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution\nmatching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the\nSNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR\nlevels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training\nobjective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous\nmathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art\nimage and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and\nWan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD\npreserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative\ncapabilities.
