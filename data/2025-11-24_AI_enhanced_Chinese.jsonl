When full task compliance is unattainable, we aim to achieve the best possible task satisfaction by integrating user preferences for relaxation into the planning process. Utilizing the automata-based representations for temporal logic goals and user preferences, we propose an A*-based planning framework. This approach effectively tackles large-scale problems while generating near-optimal high-level trajectories. To facilitate this, we propose a simple, efficient heuristic that allows for planning over large robot environments in a fraction of time and search memory as compared to uninformed search algorithms.

Here, we introduce Single-Pixel Tactile Skin (SPTS), a paradigm that uses compressive sampling to reconstruct rich tactile information from an entire sensor array via a single output channel. This is achieved through a direct circuit-level implementation where each sensing element, equipped with a miniature microcontroller, contributes a dynamically weighted analog signal to a global sum, performing distributed compressed sensing in hardware. Our flexible, daisy-chainable design simplifies wiring to a few input lines and one output, and significantly reduces measurement requirements compared to raster scanning methods. We demonstrate the system's performance by achieving object classification at an effective 3500 FPS and by capturing transient dynamics, resolving an 8 ms projectile impact into 23 frames. A key feature is the support for adaptive reconstruction, where sensing fidelity scales with measurement time. This allows for rapid contact localization using as little as 7% of total data, followed by progressive refinement to a high-fidelity image - a capability critical for responsive robotic systems.

However, designing diverse and physically realistic protein structure and surfaces that precisely complement target receptors remains a significant challenge in computational protein design. In this work, we introduce PepBridge, a novel framework for the joint design of protein surface and structure that seamlessly integrates receptor surface geometry and biochemical properties. Starting with a receptor surface represented as a 3D point cloud, PepBridge generates complete protein structures through a multi-step process. First, it employs denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) to map receptor surfaces to ligand surfaces.

Recent work indicates that the use of robot-to-camera transformation information ({\\ie}, camera extrinsics) benefits the learning process and produces better results. However, camera extrinsics are oftentimes unavailable and estimation methods usually suffer from local minima and poor generalizations. In this paper, we present CalibAll, a simple yet effective method that \\textbf{requires only a single mark} and performs training-free, stable, and accurate camera extrinsic estimation across diverse robots and datasets through a coarse-to-fine calibration pipeline. In particular, we annotate a single mark on an end-effector (EEF), and leverage the correspondence ability emerged from vision foundation models (VFM) to automatically localize the corresponding mark across robots in diverse datasets. Using this mark, together with point tracking and the 3D EEF trajectory, we obtain a coarse camera extrinsic via temporal Perspective-n-Point (PnP). This estimate is further refined through a rendering-based optimization that aligns rendered and ground-true masks, yielding accurate and stable camera extrinsic. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, showing strong robustness and general effectiveness across three robot platforms.

In this study, we focus on macaque monkeys, widely studied in systems neuroscience and evolutionary research, and propose a method to generate their facial expressions using a style-based generative image model (i.e., StyleGAN2). To address data limitations, we implemented: 1) data augmentation by synthesizing new facial expression images using a motion transfer to animate still images with computer graphics, 2) sample selection based on the latent representation of macaque faces from an initially trained StyleGAN2 model to ensure the variation and uniform sampling in training dataset, and 3) loss function refinement to ensure the accurate reproduction of subtle movements, such as eye movements. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method enables the generation of diverse facial expressions for multiple macaque individuals, outperforming models trained solely on original still images.

Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety.\n  In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization.

Model-based and learning-based methods often fail in highly dynamic scenarios because traditional methods assume a static environment and cannot adapt to real-time changes, while learning-based methods rely on single-frame observations for motion constraint estimation, limiting their adaptability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework that leverages multi-frame point constraints, including current and future frames predicted by a dedicated module, to enable proactive end-to-end navigation.

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era.

To this end, we propose H-GAR, a Hierarchical interaction framework via Goal-driven observation-Action Refinement.To anchor prediction to the task objective, H-GAR first produces a goal observation and a coarse action sketch that outline a high-level route toward the goal. To enable explicit interaction between observation and action under the guidance of the goal observation for more coherent decision-making, we devise two synergistic modules. (1) Goal-Conditioned Observation Synthesizer (GOS) synthesizes intermediate observations based on the coarse-grained actions and the predicted goal observation. (2) Interaction-Aware Action Refiner (IAAR) refines coarse actions into fine-grained, goal-consistent actions by leveraging feedback from the intermediate observations and a Historical Action Memory Bank that encodes prior actions to ensure temporal consistency. By integrating goal grounding with explicit action-observation interaction in a coarse-to-fine manner, H-GAR enables more accurate manipulation.

However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D).

However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise.

However, recent Vision-Language-Action models focus on direct action prediction and earlier progress methods predict numeric achievements; both overlook the monotonic co-progression property of the observation and instruction sequences. Building on this insight, Progress-Think introduces semantic progress reasoning, predicting instruction-style progress from visual observations to enable more accurate navigation. To achieve this without expensive annotations, we propose a three-stage framework. In the initial stage, Self-Aligned Progress Pretraining bootstraps a reasoning module via a novel differentiable alignment between visual history and instruction prefixes. Then, Progress-Guided Policy Pretraining injects learned progress states into the navigation context, guiding the policy toward consistent actions.

Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs.

We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention.

We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation.

However, for single object SVGs, generating multi-view consistent SVGs from a single-view input remains underexplored. We present a three stage framework that produces multi-view SVGs with geometric and color consistency from a single SVG input. First, the rasterized input is lifted to a 3D representation and rendered under target camera poses, producing multi-view images of the object. Next, we extend the temporal memory mechanism of Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) to the spatial domain, constructing a spatial memory bank that establishes part level correspondences across neighboring views, yielding cleaner and more consistent vector paths and color assignments without retraining. Finally, during the raster to vector conversion, we perform path consolidation and structural optimization to reduce redundancy while preserving boundaries and semantics. The resulting SVGs exhibit strong geometric and color consistency across views, significantly reduce redundant paths, and retain fine structural details.

Particularly, this is evident within resource-constrained and security-sensitive environments such as those encountered in networks associated with the Internet of Things (IoT). Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL. Many FL approaches have been proposed to enhance learning effectiveness under statistical heterogeneity. However, prior studies have uncovered a gap in the existing research landscape, particularly in the absence of a comprehensive comparison between federated methods addressing statistical heterogeneity in detecting IoT attacks. In this research endeavor, we delve into the exploration of FL algorithms, specifically FedAvg, FedProx, and Scaffold, under different data distributions. Our focus is on achieving a comprehensive understanding of and addressing the challenges posed by statistical heterogeneity.

Traditional Demand-Driven Navigation (DDN) handles one need at a time but does not reflect the complexity of real-world tasks involving multiple needs and personal choices. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring).

Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMesh RAG\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u4e91\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u589e\u91cf\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u589e\u91cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u589e\u91cf\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "Mesh RAG\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The proposed simulator includes net dynamics, contact between the net and the debris, self-contact of the net, orbital mechanics, and a controller that can actuate thrusters on the four satellites at the corners of the net. It showcases the case of capturing Envisat, a large ESA satellite that remains in orbit as space debris following the end of its mission. This work investigates different mechanical models, which can be used to simulate the net dynamics, simulating various degrees of compliance, and different control strategies to achieve the capture of the debris, depending on the relative position of the net and the target. Unlike previous works on this topic, we do not assume that the net has been previously ballistically thrown toward the target, and we start from a relatively static configuration. The results show that a more compliant net achieves higher performance when attempting the capture of Envisat. Moreover, when paired with a sliding mode controller, soft nets are able to achieve successful capture in 100% of the tested cases, whilst also showcasing a higher effective area at contact and a higher number of contact points between net and Envisat.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMuJoCo\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u7f51\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e3b\u6355\u6349\u592a\u7a7a\u788e\u7247Envisat\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u67d4\u6027\u7f51\u7ed3\u5408\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u6210\u529f\u6355\u83b7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u7f51\u5df2 ballistic \u6295\u63b7\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u6784\u578b\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eMuJoCo\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u7f51\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8f68\u9053\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u56db\u536b\u661f\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u67d4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u67d4\u6027\u7f51\u5728\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u6355\u83b7\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u63a5\u89e6\u9762\u79ef\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u70b9\u6570\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u7f51\u67d4\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u6355\u83b7\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u592a\u7a7a\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing EO datasets mainly emphasize semantic understanding tasks such as captioning or classification, lacking benchmarks that align multimodal perception with measurable biophysical variables. To fill this gap, we present REO-Instruct, the first unified benchmark designed for both descriptive and regression tasks in EO. REO-Instruct establishes a cognitively interpretable logic chain in forest ecological scenario (human activity,land-cover classification, ecological patch counting, above-ground biomass (AGB) regression), bridging qualitative understanding and quantitative prediction. The dataset integrates co-registered Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 imagery with structured textual annotations generated and validated through a hybrid human AI pipeline. Comprehensive evaluation protocols and baseline results across generic VLMs reveal that current models struggle with numeric reasoning, highlighting an essential challenge for scientific VLMs. REO-Instruct offers a standardized foundation for developing and assessing next-generation geospatial models capable of both description and scientific inference.

The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data.

Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Current benchmarks test high level relationships ('left of,' 'behind', etc.) but ignore fine-grained spatial understanding needed for real world applications: precise 3D localization, physical compatibility between objects, object affordances and multi step spatial planning. In this work, we present BOP-ASK, a novel large scale dataset for object interaction reasoning for both training and benchmarking. Our data generation pipeline leverages 6D object poses from the Benchmark for Object Pose Estimation (BOP) datasets from which we derive fine grained annotations such as grasp poses, referred object poses, path planning trajectories, relative spatial and depth relationships, and object-to-object relationships. BOP-ASK comprises over 150k images and 33M question answer pairs spanning six tasks (four novel), providing a rich resource for training and evaluating VLMs. We evaluate proprietary and open sourced VLMs, and conduct human evaluations on BOP-ASK-core, a contributed test benchmark.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u6570\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6216\u5f3a\u5236\u5355\u5cf0\u5206\u5e03\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u8986\u76d6-\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5e8f\u6570\u5171\u5f62\u5206\u7c7b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6700\u77ed\u8986\u76d6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53d8\u4f53\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534715%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u5e8f\u6570\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present a novel approach to monocular vision-based exploration that can safely cover large-scale unstructured indoor and outdoor 3D environments by explicitly accounting for the properties of a sparse monocular SLAM frontend in both mapping and planning. The mapping module solves the problems of sparse depth data, free-space gaps, and large depth uncertainty by oversampling free space in texture-sparse areas and keeping track of obstacle position uncertainty. The planning module handles the added free-space uncertainty through rapid replanning and perception-aware heading control. We further show that frontier-based exploration is possible with sparse monocular depth data when parallax requirements and the possibility of textureless surfaces are taken into account. We evaluate our approach extensively in diverse real-world and simulated environments, including ablation studies.

The use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) has driven major advances in this recognition task. In real-world scenarios, the captured skeletons are not always perfect or complete because of occlusions of parts of the human body or poor communication quality, leading to missing parts in skeletons or videos with missing frames. In the presence of such non-idealities, existing GCN models perform poorly due to missing local context. To address this limitation, we propose Parts-Mamba, a hybrid GCN-Mamba model designed to enhance the ability to capture and maintain contextual information from distant joints.

The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact. Other benefits of the open dataset include the ability to explore auto-generation and calibration of forestry machine simulators and automation scenario descriptions using the data recorded in the field.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68ee\u6797\u4f5c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6FORWARD\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u5730\u5f62\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a7\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u673a\u68b0\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301AI\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u6821\u51c6\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u745e\u5178\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u4e24\u4e2a\u91c7\u4f10\u70b9\u91c7\u96c6Komatsu\u578b\u524d\u88c5\u673a\u7684\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff08RTK-GNSS\u3001360\u00b0\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u3001IMU\u3001CAN-bus\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6fc0\u5149\u626b\u63cf\u4e0eStanForD\u65e5\u5fd7\uff0c\u6807\u6ce818\u5c0f\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e1a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u5730\u5f62\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u5de5\u51b5\uff08\u4e0d\u540c\u5c65\u5e26\u3001\u8f7d\u91cd\u3001\u8f66\u901f\uff09\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5355\u5143\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u663e\u8457\u4fc3\u8fdb\u68ee\u6797\u673a\u68b0\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce the Joint Gromov-Wasserstein (JGW) objective and extend the original framework of GW to enable simultaneous matching between collections of objects. Our formulation provides a non-negative dissimilarity measure that identifies partially isomorphic distributions of mm-spaces, with point sampling convergence. We also show that the objective can be formulated and solved for point cloud object representations by adapting traditional algorithms in Optimal Transport, including entropic regularization. Our benchmarking with other variants of GW for partial matching indicates superior performance in accuracy and computational efficiency of our method, while experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show its effectiveness for multiple shape matching, including geometric shapes and biomolecular complexes, suggesting promising applications for solving complex matching problems across diverse domains, including computer graphics and structural biology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408Gromov-Wasserstein\uff08JGW\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edfGW\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGW\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u6210\u5bf9\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u5339\u914d\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5982\u5f62\u72b6\u7fa4\u6216\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u590d\u5408\u7269\u7684\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165JGW\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cJGW\u5728\u5339\u914d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6GW\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u590d\u5408\u7269\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "JGW\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u56fe\u5f62\u5b66\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE. We discovered that brain similarity increases progressively and emerges early during pretraining, despite the model not being explicitly optimized for this objective. This suggests that brain-like representations can be an emergent byproduct of learning to reconstruct missing information from naturalistic audio data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u5927\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e5f\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8111\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u662f\u5426\u4f7f\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5927\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u542c\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528 voxel-wise \u548c component-wise \u56de\u5f52\u53ca\u8868\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff08RSA\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f8336\u4e2a\u97f3\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e24\u4e2afMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728HEAREval\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8111\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u5448\u5f3a\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff08r>0.7\uff09\uff1bEnCodecMAE\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8111\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9010\u6b65\u4e0a\u5347\u4e14\u65e9\u671f\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8111\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u975e\u523b\u610f\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u97f3\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u526f\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002"}}

In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image.

The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\\%$ and $92.11\\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies.

A major bottleneck lies in the scarcity of large-scale, action-annotated data for dexterous skills, as teleoperation is difficult and costly. Human data, with its vast scale and diverse manipulation behaviors, provides rich priors for learning robotic actions. While prior works have explored leveraging human demonstrations, they are often constrained by limited scenarios and a large visual gap between human and robots. To eliminate these limitations, we propose METIS, a vision-language-action (VLA) model for dexterous manipulation pretrained on multi-source egocentric datasets. We first construct EgoAtlas, which integrates large-scale human and robotic data from multiple sources, all unified under a consistent action space. We further extract motion-aware dynamics, a compact and discretized motion representation, which provides efficient and expressive supervision for VLA training. Built upon them, METIS integrates reasoning and acting into a unified framework, enabling effective deployment to downstream dexterous manipulation tasks. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities, achieving highest average success rate in six real-world tasks. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness to out-of-distribution scenarios.

These characteristics make glass surface detection a challenging computer vision task. Existing glass surface detection methods always rely on boundary cues (e.g., window and door frames) or reflection cues to locate glass surfaces, but they fail to fully exploit the intrinsic properties of the glass itself for accurate localization. We observed that in most real-world scenes, the illumination intensity in front of the glass surface differs from that behind it, which results in variations in the reflections visible on the glass surface. Specifically, when standing on the brighter side of the glass and applying a flash towards the darker side, existing reflections on the glass surface tend to disappear. Conversely, while standing on the darker side and applying a flash towards the brighter side, distinct reflections will appear on the glass surface. Based on this phenomenon, we propose NFGlassNet, a novel method for glass surface detection that leverages the reflection dynamics present in flash/no-flash imagery. Specifically, we propose a Reflection Contrast Mining Module (RCMM) for extracting reflections, and a Reflection Guided Attention Module (RGAM) for fusing features from reflection and glass surface for accurate glass surface detection. For learning our network, we also construct a dataset consisting of 3.3K no-flash and flash image pairs captured from various scenes with corresponding ground truth annotations.

Recent advances in locomotion and whole-body tracking have enabled impressive progress in either agile dynamic skills or stability-critical behaviors, but existing methods remain specialized, focusing on one capability while compromising the other. In this work, we introduce AMS (Agility Meets Stability), the first framework that unifies both dynamic motion tracking and extreme balance maintenance in a single policy. Our key insight is to leverage heterogeneous data sources: human motion capture datasets that provide rich, agile behaviors, and physically constrained synthetic balance motions that capture stability configurations. To reconcile the divergent optimization goals of agility and stability, we design a hybrid reward scheme that applies general tracking objectives across all data while injecting balance-specific priors only into synthetic motions. Further, an adaptive learning strategy with performance-driven sampling and motion-specific reward shaping enables efficient training across diverse motion distributions. We validate AMS extensively in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Experiments demonstrate that a single policy can execute agile skills such as dancing and running, while also performing zero-shot extreme balance motions like Ip Man's Squat, highlighting AMS as a versatile control paradigm for future humanoid applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "AMS\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u654f\u6377\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u6781\u81f4\u5e73\u8861\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u540c\u65f6\u5b8c\u6210\u8df3\u821e\u3001\u8dd1\u6b65\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5e73\u8861\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u654f\u6377\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0eUnitree G1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5355\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u654f\u6377\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u8df3\u821e\uff09\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6781\u7aef\u5e73\u8861\uff08\u5982\u53f6\u95ee\u8e72\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "AMS\u4e3a\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In constructing this, we design a pipeline consisting of LLM-based key object extraction, automatic spatial annotation and manual quality inspection, resulting in over 5K untrimmed videos with 27K objects across 100 types of audio-visual events. Building on this dataset, we define three core tasks for spatio-temporal reasoning in audio-visual scenes and generate more than 8K high-quality, evenly distributed question-answer pairs to effectively benchmark model performance. To further enhance reasoning, we propose AVST-Zero, a reinforcement learning-based model that avoids intermediate supervision, directly optimizing behavior via carefully designed multi-dimensional rewards. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our R-AVST in advancing audio-visual spatio-temporal reasoning, upon which AVST-Zero demonstrates competitive performance compared to existing models.

Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency.

While recent studies have explored alternative degradation processes beyond Gaussian noise, this paper bridges two key diffusion paradigms: hot diffusion, which relies entirely on noise, and cold diffusion, which uses only blurring without noise. We argue that hot diffusion fails to exploit the strong correlation between high-frequency image detail and low-frequency structures, leading to random behaviors in the early steps of generation. Conversely, while cold diffusion leverages image correlations for prediction, it neglects the role of noise (randomness) in shaping the data manifold, resulting in out-of-manifold issues and partially explaining its performance drop. To integrate both strengths, we propose Warm Diffusion, a unified Blur-Noise Mixture Diffusion Model (BNMD), to control blurring and noise jointly.

Existing embodied benchmarks largely focus on passive, static household environments and evaluate only isolated capabilities, failing to capture holistic performance in dynamic, real-world complexity. To fill this gap, we present IndustryNav, the first dynamic industrial navigation benchmark for active spatial reasoning. IndustryNav leverages 12 manually created, high-fidelity Unity warehouse scenarios featuring dynamic objects and human movement. Our evaluation employs a PointGoal navigation pipeline that effectively combines egocentric vision with global odometry to assess holistic local-global planning. Crucially, we introduce the \"collision rate\" and \"warning rate\" metrics to measure safety-oriented behaviors and distance estimation. A comprehensive study of nine state-of-the-art VLLMs (including models such as GPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5, and Gemini-2.5) reveals that closed-source models maintain a consistent advantage; however, all agents exhibit notable deficiencies in robust path planning, collision avoidance and active exploration.

However, most existing quality assessment datasets and models provide only a single quality score, which is too coarse to offer targeted guidance for improving generative models. In current applications of AI-generated images, realism and plausibility are two critical dimensions, and with the emergence of unified generation-understanding models, fine-grained evaluation along these dimensions becomes especially effective for improving generative performance. Therefore, we introduce Q-Real, a novel dataset for fine-grained evaluation of realism and plausibility in AI-generated images. Q-Real consists of 3,088 images generated by popular text-to-image models. For each image, we annotate the locations of major entities and provide a set of judgment questions and attribution descriptions for these along the dimensions of realism and plausibility. Considering that recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) enable fine-grained evaluation of AI-generated images, we construct Q-Real Bench to evaluate them on two tasks: judgment and grounding with reasoning. Finally, to enhance MLLM capabilities, we design a fine-tuning framework and conduct experiments on multiple MLLMs using our dataset.

Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints.

Our goal is to achieve unification along three axes: the model, the tasks, and the representations. At the representation level, we eliminate modality discrepancies by mapping both text and images into a shared visual space: textual prompts are rendered as painted text images on a clean canvas, and all inputs and outputs are treated purely as RGB pixels. This yields a fully vision-native formulation of multimodal learning. At the task level, a broad range of vision-language problems are cast as pixel-to-pixel transformations in this visual space. For understanding tasks, the model takes an RGB image and produces a painted text image that visually encodes the semantic prediction. For generation tasks, painted text images serve as visual conditions that guide realistic and semantically aligned image synthesis. Captioning and text-to-image generation thus become different directions of the same underlying visual translation process. At the model level, we instantiate a single Unified Diffusion Transformer trained with rectified flow in pixel space. A shared backbone jointly learns bidirectional mappings between natural images and painted text images, with lightweight task embeddings to specify the desired direction. Experiments on text-to-image synthesis and image-to-text understanding demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment and emergent controllability such as cycle-consistent image-caption-image loops.

Despite considerable progress in BCI research, most current motion control systems are limited to discrete commands, rather than supporting continuous pursuit, where users can freely adjust speed and direction in real time. Such natural mobility control is, however, essential for wheelchair users to navigate complex public spaces, such as transit stations, airports, hospitals, and indoor corridors, to interact socially with the dynamic populations with agility, and to move flexibly and comfortably as autonomous driving is refined to allow movement at will. In this study, we address the gap of continuous pursuit motion control in BCIs by proposing and validating a brain-inspired Bayesian inference framework, where embodied dynamics in acceleration-based motor representations are decoded. This approach contrasts with conventional kinematics-level decoding and deep learning-based methods. Using a public dataset with sixteen hours of EEG from four subjects performing motor imagery-based target-following, we demonstrate that our method, utilizing Automatic Relevance Determination for feature selection and continual online learning, reduces the normalized mean squared error between predicted and true velocities by 72% compared to autoregressive and EEGNet-based methods in a session-accumulative transfer learning setting. Theoretically, these findings empirically support embodied cognition theory and reveal the brain's intrinsic motor control dynamics in an embodied and predictive nature. Practically, grounding EEG decoding in the same dynamical principles that govern biological motion offers a promising path toward more stable and intuitive BCI control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0EEG\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f6e\u6905\u5bfc\u822a\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709BCI\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u79bb\u6563\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5982\u673a\u573a\u3001\u533b\u9662\u7b49\u516c\u5171\u573a\u6240\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u79fb\u52a8", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u786e\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548cEEGNet\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u572816\u5c0f\u65f6EEG\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e72%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5177\u8eab\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba", "conclusion": "\u5c06EEG\u89e3\u7801\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u539f\u5219\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u76f4\u89c2\u7684BCI\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84"}}

While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments.

Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $\u03c0_0$-FAST and $\u03c0_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\\times$ fewer robot demonstrations.

However, they suffer from error accumulation, spatial artifacts, and a trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity, primarily caused by inaccurate alignment and insufficient compensation between video frames. In this paper, within the DM-based VSR pipeline, we revisit the role of alignment and compensation between adjacent video frames and reveal two crucial observations: (a) the feature domain is better suited than the pixel domain for information compensation due to its stronger spatial and temporal correlations, and (b) warping at an upscaled resolution better preserves high-frequency information, but this benefit is not necessarily monotonic. Therefore, we propose a novel Densely Guided diffusion model with Aligned Features for Video Super-Resolution (DGAF-VSR), with an Optical Guided Warping Module (OGWM) to maintain high-frequency details in the aligned features and a Feature-wise Temporal Condition Module (FTCM) to deliver dense guidance in the feature domain.

Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life.

The dataset covers 16 scenarios, including residential, commercial, and working environments, with 421 tasks systematically organized by bimanual coordination patterns and object properties. Our key innovation is a hierarchical capability pyramid that provides multi-level annotations, spanning trajectory-level concepts, segment-level subtasks, and frame-level kinematics. We further develop CoRobot, a comprehensive processing framework featuring Robot Trajectory Markup Language (RTML) for quality assessment, automated annotation generation, and unified multi-embodiment management.

Manual claim drafting is labor-intensive, costly, and inherently inconsistent, while conventional Large Language Models (LLMs) often lack the structured, iterative reasoning essential for precise claim refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\\%, and up to 9\\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTree of Claims (ToC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MCTS\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u52a8\u64b0\u5199\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfLLM\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8fed\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u51c6\u4f18\u5316\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "ToC\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08MCTS\uff09\u4e0e\u53cc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08EditorAgent\u548cExaminerAgent\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u8303\u56f4\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57281145\u4e2a\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cToC\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfLLM\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53478%\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6848\u4f8b\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe9%\u3002", "conclusion": "ToC\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4e13\u5229\u6743\u5229\u8981\u6c42\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e0eMCTS\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5229\u5ba1\u67e5\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation.

Despite their practical success, theoretically understanding the gradient descent dynamics for training DEQs remains an area of active research. In this work, we rigorously study the gradient descent dynamics for DEQs in the simple setting of linear models and single-index models, filling several gaps in the literature. We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time. We then prove linear convergence of gradient descent to a global minimizer for linear DEQs and deep equilibrium single-index models under appropriate initialization and with a sufficiently small step size.

We demonstrate that HALO can plan informative paths that exploit this information to complete missions with multiple tasks specified in natural language. In simulation-based evaluation across large-scale environments of size up to 78,000 sq. m., HALO consistently completes tasks with less exploration time and achieves up to 68% higher competitive ratio in terms of the distance traveled compared to the state-of-the-art semantic exploration baseline.

Current privacy benchmarks are structurally insufficient for this new threat, as they primarily evaluate privacy perception while failing to address the more critical risk of privacy reasoning: a VLM's ability to infer and link distributed information to construct individual profiles. To address this critical gap, we propose \\textbf{MultiPriv}, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate individual-level privacy reasoning in VLMs. We introduce the \\textbf{Privacy Perception and Reasoning (PPR)} framework and construct a novel, bilingual multimodal dataset to support it. The dataset uniquely features a core component of synthetic individual profiles where identifiers (e.g., faces, names) are meticulously linked to sensitive attributes. This design enables nine challenging tasks evaluating the full PPR spectrum, from attribute detection to cross-image re-identification and chained inference. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of over 50 foundational and commercial VLMs. Our analysis reveals: (1) Many VLMs possess significant, unmeasured reasoning-based privacy risks. (2) Perception-level metrics are poor predictors of these reasoning risks, revealing a critical evaluation gap.

Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.", "AI": {"tldr": "FIRM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5185\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9700\u4f20\u8f93\u591a\u4e2a\u68af\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\u4e0e\u65e0\u5bb3\u6027\u7b49\u51b2\u7a81\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "FIRM\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u6c42\u89e3\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ec5\u4e0a\u4f20\u4e00\u7ec4\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u751f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6291\u5236\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eFIRM\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u7a33\u5b9a\u70b9\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7ed9\u51fa\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u6743\u8861\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6309\u504f\u597d\u8c03\u6574\u76ee\u6807\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "FIRM\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u90a6\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Conventional motion-compensated reconstructions typically rely on pre-estimated optical flow, which is inaccurate under undersampling and degrades reconstruction quality. In this work, we propose a novel implicit neural representation (INR) framework that jointly models both the dynamic image sequence and its underlying motion field. Specifically, one INR is employed to parameterize the spatiotemporal image content, while another INR represents the optical flow. The two are coupled via the optical flow equation, which serves as a physics-inspired regularization, in addition to a data consistency loss that enforces agreement with k-space measurements. This joint optimization enables simultaneous recovery of temporally coherent images and motion fields without requiring prior flow estimation. Experiments on dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art motion-compensated and deep learning approaches, achieving superior reconstruction quality, accurate motion estimation, and improved temporal fidelity.

Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering.

In this work, we propose Fine-grained Finger-level Hand Motion Captioning (FingerCap), which aims to generate textual descriptions that capture detailed finger-level semantics of hand actions. To support this task, we curate FingerCap-40K, a large-scale corpus of 40K paired hand-motion videos and captions spanning two complementary sources: concise instruction-style finger motions and diverse, naturalistic hand-object interactions. To enable effective evaluation, we employ HandJudge, a LLM-based rubric that measures finger-level correctness and motion completeness. Temporal sparsity remains a fundamental bottleneck for current Video-MLLMs, since sparse RGB sampling is insufficient to capture the subtle, high-frequency dynamics underlying fine finger motions. As a simple and compute-friendly remedy, we introduce FiGOP (Finger Group-of-Pictures), which pairs each RGB keyframe with subsequent hand keypoints until the next keyframe. A lightweight temporal encoder converts the keypoints into motion embeddings and integrates them with RGB features. FiGOP adapts the classic GOP concept to finger motion, recovering fine temporal cues without increasing RGB density.

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations.

To address these issues, we propose SING3R-SLAM, a globally consistent and compact Gaussian-based dense RGB SLAM framework. The key idea is to combine locally consistent 3D reconstructions with a unified global Gaussian representation that jointly refines scene geometry and camera poses, enabling efficient and versatile 3D mapping for multiple downstream applications. SING3R-SLAM first builds locally consistent submaps through our lightweight tracking and reconstruction module, and then progressively aligns and fuses them into a global Gaussian map that enforces cross-view geometric consistency. This global map, in turn, provides feedback to correct local drift and enhance the robustness of tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SING3R-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art tracking, 3D reconstruction, and novel view rendering, resulting in over 12% improvement in tracking and producing finer, more detailed geometry, all while maintaining a compact and memory-efficient global representation on real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSING3R-SLAM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u5bc6\u96c6RGB-SLAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bc6\u96c63D\u91cd\u5efa\u5728SLAM\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u70b9\u4e91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u518d\u9010\u6b65\u5bf9\u9f50\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u5e76\u53cd\u9988\u4fee\u6b63\u5c40\u90e8\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d8512%\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "SING3R-SLAM\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u591a\u7528\u9014\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Existing methods primarily focus on fully-supervised learning and rely on costly, time-consuming temporal boundary annotations. In this paper, we investigate point-supervised facial expression spotting (P-FES), where only a single timestamp annotation per instance is required for training. We propose a unique two-branch framework for P-FES. First, to mitigate the limitation of hard pseudo-labeling, which often confuses neutral and expression frames with various intensities, we propose a Gaussian-based instance-adaptive intensity modeling (GIM) module to model instance-level expression intensity distribution for soft pseudo-labeling. By detecting the pseudo-apex frame around each point label, estimating the duration, and constructing an instance-level Gaussian distribution, GIM assigns soft pseudo-labels to expression frames for more reliable intensity supervision. The GIM module is incorporated into our framework to optimize the class-agnostic expression intensity branch. Second, we design a class-aware apex classification branch that distinguishes macro- and micro-expressions solely based on their pseudo-apex frames. During inference, the two branches work independently: the class-agnostic expression intensity branch generates expression proposals, while the class-aware apex-classification branch is responsible for macro- and micro-expression classification.Furthermore, we introduce an intensity-aware contrastive loss to enhance discriminative feature learning and suppress neutral noise by contrasting neutral frames with expression frames with various intensities.

Since large-scale 3D annotation is prohibitively expensive, recent work explores self-supervised learning directly from sensor data without manual labels.

We introduce QueryOcc, a query-based self-supervised framework that learns continuous 3D semantic occupancy directly through independent 4D spatio-temporal queries sampled across adjacent frames. The framework supports supervision from either pseudo-point clouds derived from vision foundation models or raw lidar data. To enable long-range supervision and reasoning under constant memory, we introduce a contractive scene representation that preserves near-field detail while smoothly compressing distant regions.

However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening.

We present MatPedia, a foundation model built upon a novel joint RGB-PBR representation that compactly encodes materials into two interdependent latents: one for RGB appearance and one for the four PBR maps encoding complementary physical properties. By formulating them as a 5-frame sequence and employing video diffusion architectures, MatPedia naturally captures their correlations while transferring visual priors from RGB generation models. This joint representation enables a unified framework handling multiple material tasks--text-to-material generation, image-to-material generation, and intrinsic decomposition--within a single architecture.

We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior.

Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (\"retain-invariant\"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects.

Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps. The resulting dataset provides twice-daily, 1 km LST observations for the entire pan-Arctic region over four decades. This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Additionally, it supports climate monitoring efforts in the pre-MODIS era and offers a framework adaptable to future satellite missions for thermal infrared observation and climate data record continuity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5c06AVHRR GAC\u6570\u636e\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81f31 km\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e8642\u5e74pan-Arctic\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5730\u8868\u6e29\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51bb\u571f\u3001\u51b0\u76d6\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "AVHRR\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fc7\u4f4e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u5317\u6781\u7ec6\u5c3a\u5ea6\u51bb\u571f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u957f\u671fLST\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u6c14\u5019\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eMODIS LST\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7c97\u5316AVHRR\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387MODIS\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u548c\u690d\u88ab\u9ad8\u5ea6\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u4e8642\u5e74\u3001\u6bcf\u65e5\u4e24\u6b21\u30011 km\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5168\u5317\u6781LST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51bb\u571f\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u8fd1\u5730\u8868\u6c14\u6e29\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u683c\u9675\u5170\u51b0\u76d6\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86MODIS\u524d\u65f6\u4ee3\u7684\u70ed\u7ea2\u5916\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u536b\u661f\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6c14\u5019\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns\" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries.

The timely and accurate detection of these diseases from plant leaf images is critical to mitigating their adverse effects. Deep neural network Ensembles (Deep Ensembles) have emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of diverse Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, selecting high-performing ensemble member models is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in measuring ensemble diversity. In this paper, we introduce the Synergistic Diversity (SQ) framework to enhance plant disease detection accuracy. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of existing ensemble diversity metrics (denoted as Q metrics), which often fail to identify optimal ensemble teams. Second, we present the SQ metric, a novel measure that captures the synergy between ensemble members and consistently aligns with ensemble accuracy. Third, we validate our SQ approach through extensive experiments on a plant leaf image dataset, which demonstrates that our SQ metric substantially improves ensemble selection and enhances detection accuracy.

Code to be released upon full publication", "summary": "Sampling useful three-dimensional molecular structures along with their most favorable conformations is a key challenge in drug discovery. Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time.

Understanding what makes humans perceive an image as complex is also a long-standing question in cognitive science. Recent approaches have leveraged multimodal models that combine visual and linguistic representations, but it remains unclear whether language information is necessary for this task. We propose DReX (DINO-ResNet Fusion), a vision-only model that fuses self-supervised and convolutional representations through a learnable attention mechanism to predict image complexity. Our architecture integrates multi-scale hierarchical features from ResNet-50 with semantically rich representations from DINOv3 ViT-S/16, enabling the model to capture both low-level texture patterns and high-level semantic structure. DReX achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IC9600 benchmark (Pearson r = 0.9581), surpassing previous methods--including those trained on multimodal image-text data--while using approximately 21.5x fewer learnable parameters. Furthermore, DReX generalizes robustly across multiple datasets and metrics, achieving superior results on Pearson and Spearman correlation, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Ablation and attention analyses confirm that DReX leverages complementary cues from both backbones, with the DINOv3 [CLS] token enhancing sensitivity to visual complexity. Our findings suggest that visual features alone can be sufficient for human-aligned complexity prediction and that, when properly fused, self-supervised transformers and supervised deep convolutional neural networks offer complementary and synergistic benefits for this task.", "AI": {"tldr": "DReX\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u8981\u4ecd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff1b\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDReX\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u878d\u5408ResNet-50\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u7279\u5f81\u4e0eDINOv3 ViT\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728IC9600\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230Pearson r=0.9581\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c1121.5\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763Transformer\u4e0e\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u878d\u5408\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a unified Memory-Enhanced Visual-Language Recovery (MVLR) model that restores images from different degradation levels under various weather conditions. MVLR couples a lightweight encoder-decoder backbone with a Visual-Language Model (VLM) and an Implicit Memory Bank (IMB). The VLM performs chain-of-thought inference to encode weather degradation priors and the IMB stores continuous latent representations of degradation patterns. The VLM-generated priors query the IMB to retrieve fine-grained degradation prototypes. These prototypes are then adaptively fused with multi-scale visual features via dynamic cross-attention mechanisms, enhancing restoration accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on four severe-weather benchmarks show that MVLR surpasses single-branch and Mixture-of-Experts baselines in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).

SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model). Our experiments span five canonical datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, and demonstrate substantial gains post-training.

However, conventional prompt tuning methods are prone to overfitting and can struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. To address these limitations, Bayesian prompt learning has been proposed, which frames prompt optimization as a Bayesian inference problem to enhance robustness. This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5ReBaPL\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5438\u5f15-\u6392\u65a5\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u793a\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u540e\u9a8c\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5faa\u73af\u6b65\u957f\u4e0eSGHMC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08MMD\u3001Wasserstein\uff09\u7684\u6392\u65a5\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "ReBaPL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u610f\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Since lens blur typically varies with scene depth, the placement of virtual objects and their corresponding blur levels significantly affect the visual fidelity of mixed reality compositions. Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network.

While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies.

Without any manual layout design or panoramic image guidance, our framework can generate explicit layout criteria for rational spatial placement. We begin by introducing a hierarchical structure of language-driven agent planners that can automatically parse short and ambiguous prompts into detailed scene descriptions. These descriptions include raw spatial and semantic attributes for each object and the background, which are then used to initialize 3D point clouds. To position objects within bounded environments, we implement two arrangement constraints that iteratively optimize spatial arrangements, ensuring a collision-free and accessible layout solution. In the final rendering stage, we propose a novel AnyReach Sampling strategy for camera trajectory, along with the Interval Timestep Flow Sampling (ITFS) strategy, to efficiently optimize the coarse 3D Gaussian scene representation. These approaches help reduce the total generation time to under 30 minutes.

However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6OmniPT\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LVLM\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "LVLM\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6070\u597d\u662fLVLM\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6240\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1OmniPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5148RL\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u6846\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u884c\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bad\uff0c\u63a5\u7740SFT\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u518dRL\u4f18\u5316\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOmniPT\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniPT\u6210\u529f\u5c06LVLM\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning.

We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime.

The autoencoder encodes completions into compact global feature vectors (GFVs), which are selectively adjusted by an RL agent to improve geometric fidelity. To ensure robustness, a lightweight non-parametric PointNN selector evaluates the geometric consistency of both the original completion and the RL-refined output, retaining the better reconstruction. When ground truth is available, both Chamfer Distance and geometric consistency metrics guide refinement. Training is performed separately per category, since the unsupervised and dynamic nature of RL makes convergence across highly diverse categories challenging. Nevertheless, the framework can be extended to multi-category refinement in future work.

Towards their part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, REArtGS~\\cite{wu2025reartgs} introduces a category-agnostic approach using multi-view RGB images at two different states. However, we observe that REArtGS still struggles with screw-joint or multi-part objects and lacks geometric constraints for unseen states. In this paper, we propose REArtGS++, a novel method towards generalizable articulated object reconstruction with temporal geometry constraint and planar Gaussian splatting. We first model a decoupled screw motion for each joint without type prior, and jointly optimize part-aware Gaussians with joint parameters through part motion blending. To introduce time-continuous geometric constraint for articulated modeling, we encourage Gaussians to be planar and propose a temporally consistent regularization between planar normal and depth through Taylor first-order expansion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world articulated objects demonstrate our superiority in generalizable part-level surface reconstruction and joint parameter estimation, compared to existing approaches.

Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance.

To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships.

In this paper, we introduce DiverseVAR, a simple yet effective approach that restores the generative diversity of VAR models without requiring any additional training. Our analysis reveals the pivotal component of the feature map as a key factor governing diversity formation at early scales. By suppressing the pivotal component in the model input and amplifying it in the model output, DiverseVAR effectively unlocks the inherent generative potential of VAR models while preserving high-fidelity synthesis.

While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values.

Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions.

To address the limitations, we propose a category-agnostic articulated object reconstruction framework via planar Gaussian Splatting, which only uses sparse-view RGB images from a single state. Specifically, we first introduce a Gaussian information field to perceive the optimal sparse viewpoints from candidate camera poses. Then we compress 3D Gaussians into planar Gaussians to facilitate accurate estimation of normal and depth. The planar Gaussians are optimized in a coarse-to-fine manner through depth smooth regularization and few-shot diffusion. Moreover, we introduce a part segmentation probability for each Gaussian primitive and update them by back-projecting part segmentation masks of renderings.

Recent advances in large pre-trained models have opened new opportunities for training-free VAD by leveraging rich prior knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. However, existing studies typically rely on dense frame-level inference, incurring high computational costs and latency. This raises a fundamental question: Is dense reasoning truly necessary when using powerful pre-trained models in VAD systems? To answer this, we propose ReCoVAD, a novel framework inspired by the dual reflex and conscious pathways of the human nervous system, enabling selective frame processing to reduce redundant computation. ReCoVAD consists of two core pathways: (i) a Reflex pathway that uses a lightweight CLIP-based module to fuse visual features with prototype prompts and produce decision vectors, which query a dynamic memory of past frames and anomaly scores for fast response; and (ii) a Conscious pathway that employs a medium-scale vision-language model to generate textual event descriptions and refined anomaly scores for novel frames. It continuously updates the memory and prototype prompts, while an integrated large language model periodically reviews accumulated descriptions to identify unseen anomalies, correct errors, and refine prototypes. Extensive experiments show that ReCoVAD achieves state-of-the-art training-free performance while processing only 28.55\\% and 16.04\\% of the frames used by previous methods on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, demonstrating that sparse reasoning is sufficient for effective large-model-based VAD.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReCoVAD\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e27\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u63a2\u7a76\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u9700\u5bc6\u96c6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u901a\u8def\u6846\u67b6ReCoVAD\uff1a\u53cd\u5c04\u901a\u8def\uff08\u8f7b\u91cfCLIP+\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u610f\u8bc6\u901a\u8def\uff08\u4e2d\u7b49VLM+LLM\uff09\u7cbe\u70bc\u5f02\u5e38\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u539f\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728UCF-Crime\u548cXD-Violence\u4e0a\u4ec5\u5904\u740628.55%\u548c16.04%\u7684\u5e27\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3VAD\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u63a8\u7406\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6491\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bc6\u96c6\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}}

To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes.

Although recent studies have achieved notable improvements by leveraging the knowledge embedded within pre-trained visual models, the lack of direct association between factual-level features and emotional categories, called the \"affective gap\", limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for VER tasks. On the contrary, the explicit emotional expression and high information density in textual modality eliminate the \"affective gap\". Therefore, we propose borrowing the knowledge from the pre-trained textual model to enhance the emotional perception of pre-trained visual models. We focus on the factual and emotional connections between images and texts in noisy social media data, and propose Partitioned Adaptive Contrastive Learning (PACL) to leverage these connections. Specifically, we manage to separate different types of samples and devise distinct contrastive learning strategies for each type. By dynamically constructing negative and positive pairs, we fully exploit the potential of noisy samples.

However, even leading models exhibit redundant self-reflection when generating lengthy reasoning chains. While training-free CoT compression methods have emerged in the LLMs domain, they rely on static visual references and thus provide limited gains for multimodal reasoning. Therefore, we propose ChainV, a framework that dynamically integrates visual hints into the reasoning process, thereby making multimodal reasoning shorter and better. Specifically, ChainV first performs a coarse visual patch selection based on the previous reasoning step, then refines it by identifying the most representative atomic visual hint according to the averaged attention intensity. Additionally, ChainV introduces a consistency-based evaluation mechanism to assess the reliability of the chosen hint, guiding the model to adaptively adjust its level of self-reflection. Eventually, the pixel coordinates of the selected visual hint and its reliability are incorporated into thinking with a Bernoulli stochastic process. Experiments indicate that our method significantly improves reasoning accuracy and efficiency, especially on math-intensive benchmarks where visual hints are crucial for multi-step symbolic reasoning.

However, modern lighting technologies such as LEDs can deviate substantially from the Planckian locus, exposing the limitations of relying on conventional one-dimensional CCT for illumination characterization. This paper demonstrates that transitioning from 1D CCT (on the Planckian locus) to a 2D chromaticity space (off the Planckian locus) improves colorimetric accuracy across various mapping approaches. In addition, we replace conventional CCT interpolation with a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that leverages 2D chromaticity features for robust colorimetric mapping under non-Planckian illuminants. A lightbox-based calibration procedure incorporating representative LED sources is used to train our MLP. Validated across diverse LED lighting, our method reduces angular reproduction error by 22% on average in LED-lit scenes, maintains backward compatibility with traditional illuminants, accommodates multi-illuminant scenes, and supports real-time in-camera deployment with negligible additional computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8272\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfCCT\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cfMLP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LED\u7167\u660e\u4e0b\u76f8\u673a\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u8272\u6e29\uff08CCT\uff09\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u666e\u6717\u514b\u5149\u6e90\uff08\u5982LED\uff09\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0CCT\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u63cf\u8ff0\u975e Planckian \u5149\u6e90\u7684\u8272\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8272\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u66ff\u4ee3CCT\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027LED\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u5149\u7bb1\u6821\u51c6\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdLED\u7167\u660e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u89d2\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e22%\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6e90\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5149\u6e90\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8272\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u5408MLP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u975ePlanckian\u5149\u6e90\u4e0b\u7684\u8272\u5f69\u6620\u5c04\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfCCT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u66f4\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work presents a complete, multi-stage optimization framework to bridge the gap between high-performance floating-point models and efficient, hardware-friendly integer-based implementations. First, we address the fundamental problem of quantization-induced performance degradation. We propose a Dynamic Range-Aware Quantization (DRAQ) method that uses statistically-calibrated activation clipping and a novel weight regularization scheme to counteract the effects of extreme data outliers and large dynamic ranges, successfully creating a high-fidelity 8-bit integer model. Second, building on this robust foundation, we introduce two hardware-aware optimization techniques tailored for FPGAs. A progressive mixed-precision search algorithm exploits FPGA flexibility to assign optimal, non-uniform bit-widths to each layer, minimizing complexity while preserving performance. Concurrently, a channel pruning method, adapted to work with the Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) layers common in LIC, removes model redundancy by eliminating inactive channels. Our comprehensive experiments show that the foundational DRAQ method reduces the BD-rate overhead of a GDN-based model from $30\\%$ to $6.3\\%$.

Existing methods lack the causal reasoning and multimodal understanding required for reliable generalization. We introduce $\\textbf{FireScope-Bench}$, a large-scale dataset and benchmark that couples Sentinel-2 imagery and climate data with expert-defined risk rasters across the USA, and real wildfire events in Europe for cross-continental evaluation. Building on this dataset, we propose $\\textbf{FireScope}$, a VLM-based reasoning-to-generation framework that learns from both reinforcement learning and visual supervision to predict risk rasters with complementary reasoning traces. When trained in the USA and tested in Europe, $\\textbf{FireScope}$ achieves substantial performance gains, while expert feedback and automated analysis confirm that its reasoning traces are faithful and semantically meaningful. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability.

However, since these methods typically rely on denoising human-crafted trajectory anchors or random noise, there remains significant room for improvement. In this paper, we propose DiffRefiner, a novel two-stage trajectory prediction framework. The first stage uses a transformer-based Proposal Decoder to generate coarse trajectory predictions by regressing from sensor inputs using predefined trajectory anchors. The second stage applies a Diffusion Refiner that iteratively denoises and refines these initial predictions. In this way, we enhance the performance of diffusion-based planning by incorporating a discriminative trajectory proposal module, which provides strong guidance for the generative refinement process.

To mitigate this issue, it is practical to develop unpaired image translation (UIT) methods that effectively align the statistical distributions between source and target domains, particularly under the constraint of a reused inference-blackbox setting. However, existing UIT approaches often overlook class-specific semantic alignment during domain adaptation, resulting in misaligned content-class mappings that can impair diagnostic accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose UI-Styler, a novel ultrasound-specific, class-aware image style transfer framework. UI-Styler leverages a pattern-matching mechanism to transfer texture patterns embedded in the target images onto source images while preserving the source structural content. In addition, we introduce a class-aware prompting strategy guided by pseudo labels of the target domain, which enforces accurate semantic alignment with diagnostic categories.

To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution.

We find that existing video recapture methods suffer from suboptimal camera motion injection strategies; such suboptimal designs not only limit camera control precision but also result in generated videos that fail to preserve fine visual details from the source video. To achieve more accurate and flexible motion manipulation, PostCam introduces a query-shared cross-attention module. It integrates two distinct forms of control signals: the 6-DoF camera poses and the 2D rendered video frames. By fusing them into a unified representation within a shared feature space, our model can extract underlying motion cues, which enhances both control precision and generation quality. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: the model first learns coarse camera control from pose inputs, and then incorporates visual information to refine motion accuracy and enhance visual fidelity. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that PostCam outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 20% in camera control precision and view consistency, while achieving the highest video generation quality.

Noise modeling methods can fit noise distributions to generate synthetic HSIs to train denoising networks. However, the noise in captured HSIs is usually complex and difficult to model accurately, which significantly limits the effectiveness of these approaches. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage noise-decoupling framework that decomposes complex noise into explicitly modeled and implicitly modeled components. This decoupling reduces the complexity of noise and enhances the learnability of HSI denoising methods when applied to real paired data. Specifically, for explicitly modeled noise, we utilize an existing noise model to generate paired data for pre-training a denoising network, equipping it with prior knowledge to handle the explicitly modeled noise effectively. For implicitly modeled noise, we introduce a high-frequency wavelet guided network. Leveraging the prior knowledge from the pre-trained module, this network adaptively extracts high-frequency features to target and remove the implicitly modeled noise from real paired HSIs. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate all noise components and mitigate error accumulation across stages, a multi-stage learning strategy, comprising separate pre-training and joint fine-tuning, is employed to optimize the entire framework.

In this work, we propose VLA-4D, a general VLA model with 4D awareness for spatiotemporally coherent robotic manipulation. Our model is guided by two key designs: 1) 4D-aware visual representation. We extract visual features, embed 1D time into 3D positions for 4D embeddings, and fuse them into a unified visual representation via a cross-attention mechanism. 2) Spatiotemporal action representation. We extend conventional spatial action representations with temporal information to enable the spatiotemporal planning, and align the multimodal representations into the LLM for spatiotemporal action prediction. Within this unified framework, the designed visual and action representations jointly make robotic manipulation spatially-smooth and temporally-coherent.

While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offers strong zero-shot priors and has been widely fine-tuned across downstream tasks, its large parameter count and computational overhead challenge practical deployment. This paper demonstrates that the SAM paradigm is highly promising once its computational efficiency and performance can be balanced. To this end, we introduce the Alignment Layer, a lightweight, plug-and-play module which aligns encoder-decoder feature distributions to efficiently adapt SAM to specific medical images, improving accuracy while reducing computation. Building on SAM and the Alignment Layer, we then propose Continual Alignment for SAM (CA-SAM), a continual learning strategy that automatically adapts the appropriate Alignment Layer to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while leveraging SAM's zero-shot priors to preserve strong performance on unseen medical datasets.

The projected 3D Gaussians are fused into a BEV representation via differentiable splatting, producing continuous, uncertainty-aware semantic maps without requiring undistortion or perspective rectification. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong segmentation performance on complex parking and urban driving scenarios, achieving IoU scores of 87.75% for drivable regions and 57.26% for vehicles under severe fisheye distortion and diverse environmental conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u53bb\u7578\u53d8\u7684\u7578\u53d8\u611f\u77e5BEV\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u9c7c\u773c\u56fe\u50cf\u56e0\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7578\u53d8\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u5bfc\u81f4BEV\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53cd\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5c06\u50cf\u7d20\u5347\u7ef4\u81f33D\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u518d\u7ecf\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u70b9\u4e91\u6e32\u67d3\u878d\u5408\u4e3aBEV\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u505c\u8f66\u4e0e\u57ce\u5e02\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u884c\u9a76\u533a\u57dfIoU\u8fbe87.75%\uff0c\u8f66\u8f86IoU\u8fbe57.26%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u53bb\u7578\u53d8\u6216\u900f\u89c6\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9c7c\u773c\u56fe\u50cfBEV\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

This is critical for applications like surveillance, medical imaging, and consumer electronics. However, current methods struggle with limited real-world LR-HR data, impacting the learning of basic image features. Pre-trained SR models from large-scale synthetic datasets offer valuable prior knowledge, which can improve generalization, speed up training, and reduce the need for extensive real-world data in realistic SR tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, Dual-domain Adaptation Networks, which is able to efficiently adapt pre-trained image SR models from simulated to real-world datasets. To achieve this target, we first set up a spatial-domain adaptation strategy through selectively updating parameters of pre-trained models and employing the low-rank adaptation technique to adjust frozen parameters. Recognizing that image super-resolution involves recovering high-frequency components, we further integrate a frequency domain adaptation branch into the adapted model, which combines the spectral data of the input and the spatial-domain backbone's intermediate features to infer HR frequency maps, enhancing the SR result. Experimental evaluations on public realistic image SR benchmarks, including RealSR, D2CRealSR, and DRealSR, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art models.

This fidelity term leverages the properties of quaternion convolution kernel, which consists of four kernels: one that functions similarly to a non-negative convolution kernel to capture the overall blur, and three additional convolution kernels without constraints corresponding to red, green and blue channels respectively model their unknown interdependencies.

However, improving their performance often requires fine-tuning and scaling to larger model variants. In this work, we propose a mechanism inspired by traditional text-based search to improve retrieval performance at inference time: relevance feedback. While relevance feedback can serve as an alternative to fine-tuning, its model-agnostic design also enables use with fine-tuned VLMs. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate four feedback strategies for VLM-based retrieval. First, we revise classical pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF), which refines query embeddings based on top-ranked results. To address its limitations, we propose generative relevance feedback (GRF), which uses synthetic captions for query refinement. Furthermore, we introduce an attentive feedback summarizer (AFS), a custom transformer-based model that integrates multimodal fine-grained features from relevant items. Finally, we simulate explicit feedback using ground-truth captions as an upper-bound baseline. Experiments on Flickr30k and COCO with the VLM backbones show that GRF, AFS, and explicit feedback improve retrieval performance by 3-5% in MRR@5 for smaller VLMs, and 1-3% for larger ones, compared to retrieval with no feedback. Moreover, AFS, similarly to explicit feedback, mitigates query drift and is more robust than GRF in iterative, multi-turn retrieval settings. Our findings demonstrate that relevance feedback can consistently enhance retrieval across VLMs and open up opportunities for interactive and adaptive visual search.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u53473-5%\uff0c\u4e14\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6458\u8981\u5668AFS\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u53cd\u9988\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff08PRF\uff09\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff08GRF\uff09\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u6458\u8981\u5668\uff08AFS\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u9650\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "GRF\u3001AFS\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u53cd\u9988\u5728Flickr30k\u548cCOCO\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347MRR@5\u8fbe3-5%\uff08\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u548c1-3%\uff08\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0cAFS\u6700\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u67e5\u8be2\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u63a9\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u771f\u5b9eLiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8fb9\u7f18\u573a\u666f\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4eff\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u8fd8\u539f\u771f\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8ddd\u79bb\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u5305\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a9\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u6307\u5bfc\u7269\u4f53\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u4f4d\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728KITTI-360\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u573a\u666f\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5730\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers.

This capability is essential for large-scale chemical data mining, drug discovery pipelines, and Large Language Model (LLM) applications in related domains. However, existing OCSR systems face significant challenges in accurately recognizing stereochemical information due to the subtle visual cues that distinguish stereoisomers, such as wedge and dash bonds, ring conformations, and spatial arrangements. To address these challenges, we propose MolSight, a comprehensive learning framework for OCSR that employs a three-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, we conduct pre-training on large-scale but noisy datasets to endow the model with fundamental perception capabilities for chemical structure images. In the second stage, we perform multi-granularity fine-tuning using datasets with richer supervisory signals, systematically exploring how auxiliary tasks-specifically chemical bond classification and atom localization-contribute to molecular formula recognition. Finally, we employ reinforcement learning for post-training optimization and introduce a novel stereochemical structure dataset. Remarkably, we find that even with MolSight's relatively compact parameter size, the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm can further enhance the model's performance on stereomolecular.

Existing finger pose estimation algorithms that can be implemented in portable devices predominantly rely on capacitive images, which are currently limited to estimating pitch and yaw angles and exhibit reduced accuracy when processing large-angle inputs (especially when it is greater than 45 degrees). In this paper, we propose BiFingerPose, a novel bimodal based finger pose estimation algorithm capable of simultaneously and accurately predicting comprehensive finger pose information. A bimodal input is explored, including a capacitive image and a fingerprint patch obtained from the touchscreen with an under-screen fingerprint sensor. Our approach leads to reliable estimation of roll angle, which is not achievable using only a single modality. In addition, the prediction performance of other pose parameters has also been greatly improved. The evaluation of a 12-person user study on continuous and discrete interaction tasks further validated the advantages of our approach. Specifically, BiFingerPose outperforms previous SOTA methods with over 21% improvement in prediction performance, 2.5 times higher task completion efficiency, and 23% better user operation accuracy, demonstrating its practical superiority.

Nevertheless, most MLLMs suffer from limited spatial reasoning ability to interpret and infer spatial arrangements in three-dimensional space. In this work, we propose a novel vision encoder based on hierarchical fusion of geometry and semantics features, generating spatial-aware visual embedding and boosting the spatial grounding capability of MLLMs. Specifically, we first unveil that the spatial ambiguity shortcoming stems from the lossy embedding of the vision encoder utilized in most existing MLLMs (e.g., CLIP), restricted to instance-level semantic features. This motivates us to complement CLIP with the geometry features from vision-only self-supervised learning via a hierarchical adapter, enhancing the spatial awareness in the proposed SpatialGeo. The network is efficiently trained using pretrained LLaVA model and optimized with random feature dropping to avoid trivial solutions relying solely on the CLIP encoder. Experimental results show that SpatialGeo improves the accuracy in spatial reasoning tasks, enhancing state-of-the-art models by at least 8.0% in SpatialRGPT-Bench with approximately 50% less memory cost during inference.

To overcome the challenges, our approach begins with a relative pose initialization with explicit feature matching, followed by a local joint optimization to enhance the pose estimation for training a more robust NeRF representation. This method significantly improves the quality of initial poses. Additionally, we introduce global optimization phase that incorporates geometric consistency constraints through bundle adjustment, which integrates feature trajectories to further refine poses and collectively boost the quality of NeRF.

However, one domain in which they perform notably poorly is in the synthesis of transparent objects, which exhibit refraction, reflection, absorption and scattering. Refraction is a particular challenge, because refracted pixel rays often intersect with surfaces observed in other parts of the image, providing a constraint on the color. It is clear from inspection that generative models have not distilled the laws of optics sufficiently well to accurately render refractive objects. In this work, we consider the problem of generating images with accurate refraction, given a text prompt. We synchronize the pixels within the object's boundary with those outside by warping and merging the pixels using Snell's Law of Refraction, at each step of the generation trajectory. For those surfaces that are not directly observed in the image, but are visible via refraction or reflection, we recover their appearance by synchronizing the image with a second generated image -- a panorama centered at the object -- using the same warping and merging procedure.

This enables consistent texture evolution and process transfer across styles. A reverse-painting training strategy further ensures smooth, human-aligned generation.

A key challenge of this task lies in its dependence on large, manually labeled datasets whose acquisition is costly and time-consuming. This paper devises a novel, label-efficient method for skeleton-based action recognition using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The contribution of the proposed method resides in learning a novel acquisition function -- scoring the most informative subsets for labeling -- as the optimum of an objective function mixing data representativity, diversity and uncertainty. We also extend this approach by learning the most informative subsets using an invertible GCN which allows mapping data from ambient to latent spaces where the inherent distribution of the data is more easily captured.

Specifically, DSeq-JEPA (i) first identifies primary discriminative regions based on a transformer-derived saliency map, emphasizing the distribution of visual importance, and then (ii) predicts subsequent regions in this discriminative order, progressively forming a curriculum-like semantic progression from primary to secondary cues -- a form of GPT-style pre-training.

By capturing micro-level morphological and intensity patterns, these features support more precise tumor identification and improve AI interpretability by highlighting diagnostically relevant cells for pathologist review. However, most existing studies focus on slide-level or patch-level tumor classification, leaving cell-level radiomics analysis largely unexplored. Moreover, there is currently no dedicated backbone specifically designed for radiomics data. Inspired by the recent success of the Mamba architecture in vision and language domains, we introduce a Unified Attention-Mamba (UAM) backbone for cell-level classification using radiomics features. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74% to 78% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75% to 80% ($n$=406 patches).

Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks.

Although SDF values provide a naturally smooth and continuous geometric field, preserving this smoothness across independently parameterized sparse voxels is nontrivial. To address this challenge, we promote coherent and smooth voxel-wise structure through (1) robust geometric initialization using a visual geometry model and (2) a spatial smoothness loss that enforces coherent relationships across parent-child and sibling voxel groups.

Existing reinforcement learning frameworks often project this space into coarse, low-dimensional representations, limiting their ability to capture spatially variant deformations. We propose MorphSeek, a fine-grained representation-level policy optimization paradigm that reformulates DIR as a spatially continuous optimization process in the latent feature space. MorphSeek introduces a stochastic Gaussian policy head atop the encoder to model a distribution over latent features, facilitating efficient exploration and coarse-to-fine refinement. The framework integrates unsupervised warm-up with weakly supervised fine-tuning through Group Relative Policy Optimization, where multi-trajectory sampling stabilizes training and improves label efficiency. Across three 3D registration benchmarks (OASIS brain MRI, LiTS liver CT, and Abdomen MR-CT), MorphSeek achieves consistent Dice improvements over competitive baselines while maintaining high label efficiency with minimal parameter cost and low step-level latency overhead.

By leveraging complementary information across shared contextual cues, it enhances the discriminative evaluation of subtle intra-class variations in highly similar action sequences. However, partial modalities are frequently unavailable at the inference stage in reality. The absence of any modality often renders existing multimodal models inoperable. Furthermore, it triggers catastrophic performance degradation due to interruptions in cross-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a novel Missing Completion Framework with Mixture of Experts (MCMoE) that unifies unimodal and joint representation learning in single-stage training. Specifically, we propose an adaptive gated modality generator that dynamically fuses available information to reconstruct missing modalities. We then design modality experts to learn unimodal knowledge and dynamically mix the knowledge of all experts to extract cross-modal joint representations. With a mixture of experts, missing modalities are further refined and complemented. Finally, in the training phase, we mine the complete multimodal features and unimodal expert knowledge to guide modality generation and generation-based joint representation extraction.

A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information.

In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: \"Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?\". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention.

In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches.

While adversarial knowledge distillation has shown promise in transferring robustness from teacher to student models, traditional single-teacher approaches suffer from limited knowledge diversity, slow convergence, and difficulty in balancing robustness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose MMT-ARD: a Multimodal Multi-Teacher Adversarial Robust Distillation framework. Our key innovation is a dual-teacher knowledge fusion architecture that collaboratively optimizes clean feature preservation and robust feature enhancement. To better handle challenging adversarial examples, we introduce a dynamic weight allocation strategy based on teacher confidence, enabling adaptive focus on harder samples. Moreover, to mitigate bias among teachers, we design an adaptive sigmoid-based weighting function that balances the strength of knowledge transfer across modalities. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and zero-shot benchmarks demonstrate that MMT-ARD improves robust accuracy by +4.32% and zero-shot accuracy by +3.5% on the ViT-B-32 model, while achieving a 2.3x increase in training efficiency over traditional single-teacher methods.

However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSketchVerify\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u6216\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b80\u5355\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u8fd0\u52a8\u5019\u9009\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8349\u56fe\u89c6\u9891\u6e32\u67d3\u52a0\u901f\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u81f3\u6ee1\u610f\u8f68\u8ff9\u540e\u518d\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5728WorldModelBench\u548cPhyWorldBench\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "SketchVerify\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8349\u56fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u3002"}}

For many emerging applications, such as comprehensive evaluations of physical AI behavior under varying conditions, the ability of world models to answer counterfactual queries, such as \"what would happen if this object was removed?\", is of increasing importance. We formalize counterfactual world models that additionally take interventions as explicit inputs, predicting temporal sequences under hypothetical modifications to observed scene properties. Traditional world models operate directly on entangled pixel-space representations where object properties and relationships cannot be selectively modified. This modeling choice prevents targeted interventions on specific scene properties. We introduce CWMDT, a framework to overcome those limitations, turning standard video diffusion models into effective counterfactual world models. First, CWMDT constructs digital twins of observed scenes to explicitly encode objects and their relationships, represented as structured text. Second, CWMDT applies large language models to reason over these representations and predict how a counterfactual intervention propagates through time to alter the observed scene. Third, CWMDT conditions a video diffusion model with the modified representation to generate counterfactual visual sequences.

Previous deep learning methods have been applied to radar modeling; however, they often fail to represent arbitrary shapes or have difficulty with real-world radar signals which are collected over limited viewing angles. Existing methods in optical 3D reconstruction can generate arbitrary shapes from limited camera views, but struggle when they naively treat the radar signal as a camera view. In this work, we present Radar2Shape, a denoising diffusion model that handles a partially observable radar signal for 3D reconstruction by correlating its frequencies with multiresolution shape features. Our method consists of a two-stage approach: first, Radar2Shape learns a regularized latent space with hierarchical resolutions of shape features, and second, it diffuses into this latent space by conditioning on the frequencies of the radar signal in an analogous coarse-to-fine manner. We demonstrate that Radar2Shape can successfully reconstruct arbitrary 3D shapes even from partially-observed radar signals, and we show robust generalization to two different simulation methods and real-world data.

It holds the body and is important for leading a healthy life. The spine is vulnerable to age-related degenerations that can be identified through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this paper we propose a novel computer-vison-based deep learning method to estimate spine age using images from over 18,000 MRI series. Data are restricted to subjects with only age-related spine degeneration. Eligibility criteria are created by identifying common age-based clusters of degenerative spine conditions using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (HDBSCAN). Model selection is determined using a detailed ablation study on data size, loss, and the effect of different spine regions. We evaluate the clinical utility of our model by calculating the difference between actual spine age and model-predicted age, the spine age gap (SAG), and examining the association between these differences and spine degenerative conditions and lifestyle factors. We find that SAG is associated with conditions including disc bulges, disc osteophytes, spinal stenosis, and fractures, as well as lifestyle factors like smoking and physically demanding work, and thus may be a useful biomarker for measuring overall spine health.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8d85\u8fc718,000\u7ec4MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u7b97\u810a\u67f1\u5e74\u9f84\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u810a\u67f1\u5e74\u9f84\u5dee\uff08SAG\uff09\u4e0e\u9000\u53d8\u75be\u75c5\u53ca\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u810a\u67f1\u968f\u5e74\u9f84\u9000\u5316\u5e38\u89c1\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u5065\u5eb7\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u91cf\u5316\u810a\u67f1\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790MRI\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408UMAP\u548cHDBSCAN\u7b5b\u9009\u7eaf\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u9000\u53d8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u810a\u67f1\u5e74\u9f84\u5dee\uff08SAG\uff09\u4e0e\u690e\u95f4\u76d8\u7a81\u51fa\u3001\u9aa8\u8d58\u3001\u690e\u7ba1\u72ed\u7a84\u3001\u9aa8\u6298\u53ca\u5438\u70df\u3001\u91cd\u4f53\u529b\u52b3\u52a8\u7b49\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "SAG\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u810a\u67f1\u6574\u4f53\u5065\u5eb7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this work, we conduct a principled analysis of downscaling intelligence in multimodal models, examining how reduced large language model (LLM) capacity affects multimodal capabilities. Our initial findings reveal an interesting trend: LLM downscaling disproportionately affects visual capabilities, rather than abilities inherited from the LLM. We then examine whether this drop mainly reflects the expected decline in visual reasoning or a more fundamental loss of perceptual abilities. Isolating the effect of LLM downscaling on perception, we find performance still drops sharply, often matching or exceeding the impact on reasoning. To address this bottleneck, we introduce visual extraction tuning, which explicitly trains the model to extract instruction-relevant visual details consistently across tasks. With these extracted visual details, we then apply step-by-step reasoning to generate answers.

While effective to some extent, these approaches often yield perceptually inferior results and struggle to scale up in model capacity and training data. In this work, we propose EvDiff, an event-based diffusion model that follows a surrogate training framework to produce high-quality videos. To reduce the heavy computational cost of high-frame-rate video generation, we design an event-based diffusion model that performs only a single forward diffusion step, equipped with a temporally consistent EvEncoder. Furthermore, our novel Surrogate Training Framework eliminates the dependence on paired event-image datasets, allowing the model to leverage large-scale image datasets for higher capacity.

This dataset is meticulously curated to ensure that edited objects faithfully adhere to the instructional changes while preserving the consistency of unedited regions with the source object. Building upon this dataset, we explore two distinct conditioning strategies for our model: a conventional cross-attention mechanism and a novel 3D token concatenation approach. Our results demonstrate that token concatenation is more parameter-efficient and achieves superior performance. Extensive evaluations show that our method outperforms existing 2D-lifting approaches, setting a new benchmark in generation quality, 3D consistency, and instruction fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c3D\u8868\u793a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3D\u4ee4\u724c\u62fc\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u76843D\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u67092D\u5347\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u578b\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u524d\u9988\u578b\u56e0\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u89c6\u56fe2D\u7f16\u8f91\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u60013D\u7f16\u8f91\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u65b0\u9896\u76843D\u4ee4\u724c\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u30013D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u67092D\u5347\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u7acb\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "3D\u4ee4\u724c\u62fc\u63a5\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a83D\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u67653D\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
