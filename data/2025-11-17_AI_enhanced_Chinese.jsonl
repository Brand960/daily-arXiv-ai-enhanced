This paper asks a precise, testable version of the \"runaway growth\" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u65adAI\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u9650\u52a0\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u63a7\u5236\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u201c\u5931\u63a7\u589e\u957f\u201d\u6216\u201c\u5947\u70b9\u201d\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u5224\u65ad\u5176\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff08\u7535\u529b\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u3001\u5185\u5b58\uff09\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5305\u7edc\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u751f\u589e\u957f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6295\u5165\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u4ece\u5b9e\u9645\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u5931\u63a7\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u533a\u5206\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u4e0e\u4e9a\u4e34\u754c\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u529b\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7b49\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u7684\u201c\u662f/\u5426\u201d\u8ba4\u8bc1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u7535\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9971\u548c\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5bf9AI\u5947\u70b9\u7684\u731c\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5982\u529f\u7387\u9650\u5236\u3001\u541e\u5410\u8282\u6d41\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u95f8\u95e8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9AI\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u3002"}}

This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS.

However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies.

Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains.

While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($\u03c1$) and head-tail ratio ($\u03b7$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy.

Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems.

However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems.

While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains.

Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition.

Based on prior work in simple orbits, our method produces a broad class of stable, periodic trajectories by stabilizing the system around a Lie group-based geometric embedding. Employing the Lie group SO(3), we generate a wider range of periodic curves than existing quaternion-based methods.

The model effectively captures long-term temporal dependencies and identifies key body-joint contributions through learned attention weights.

Accepted for publication in the Journal of Information Systems Engineering and Management", "summary": "Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement.

Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings.

PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor.

Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops.

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector.

To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system.

To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks.

This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions.

However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHCD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5b50logit\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982ViT\u5230ResNet\uff09\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9ViT\u4e0eResNet\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u6784\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56logit\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "HCD\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6c60\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5b66\u751f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u62fc\u63a5\u540e\u7ecf\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5668\uff08CFM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eablogits\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5b50logit\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\uff08SDD\uff09\u5c06logits\u62c6\u5206\u4e3an\u4e2a\u5b50logits\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6559\u5e08logits\u6821\u51c6\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6b63\u4ea4\u635f\u5931\uff08OL\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u5b50logit\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001CUB200\u548cImageNet-1K\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HCD\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL.

Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency.

Reddy"], "title": "SURFACEBENCH: Can Self-Evolving LLMs Find the Equations of 3D Scientific Surfaces?", "comment": null, "summary": "Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSurfaceBench\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u7b26\u53f7\u66f2\u9762\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u57df\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9762\u5411\u4e09\u7ef4\u66f2\u9762\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b183\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684SurfaceBench\uff0c\u6db5\u76d615\u7c7b\u7b26\u53f7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u663e\u5f0f\u3001\u9690\u5f0f\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Chamfer\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0cSurfaceBench\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "SurfaceBench\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0eLLM\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment.

However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "EarthSight\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u51cf\u5c11\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u90e8\u4e0b\u4f20\u518d\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u56e0\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u81f3\u6570\u5929\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5b64\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u536b\u661f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "method": "EarthSight\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5927\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u536b\u661f\u7aef\u5171\u4eab\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2\uff09\u5730\u9762\u7ad9\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u805a\u5408\u8bf7\u6c42\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\uff1b3\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6392\u5e8f\u7ed3\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f4e\u4ef7\u503c\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u536b\u661f\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cEarthSight\u5c06\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5e73\u5747\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c111.9\u500d\uff0c90\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ece51\u5206\u949f\u964d\u81f321\u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "EarthSight\u901a\u8fc7\u661f\u5730\u534f\u540c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8scalability\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u667a\u80fd\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations.

Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues.

Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m.

Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures.

However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks.

In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u964d\u4f4e\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u56e0\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u9ad8\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u601d\u60f3\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ebf\u7a0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u8fdb\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u540e\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u53ef\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time.

Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an \"Eigenbasis Score\", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions.

While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDMC\u548cDMC-OT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728CLIP\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CLIP\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9057\u5fd8\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u4e2d\u672a\u8003\u8651\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "DMC\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e00\u65b9\u4f18\u5316\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1bDMC-OT\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001ImageNet-R\u3001CUB-200\u548cUCF-101\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0cDMC-OT\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53471.80%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u6821\u51c6\u662f\u89e3\u51b3CLIP\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5dee\u4e0e\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms.

We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling.

In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction.

We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder.

However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration.

This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression.

To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLUE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eStable Diffusion\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u683c\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "CLUE\u5728Stable Diffusion\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165Style Encoder\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165U-Net\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u8033\u708e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFID\u4ece46.81\u964d\u81f39.30\uff0c\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ece49.60%\u63d0\u5347\u81f370.29%\uff1b1000%\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668F1\u8fbe83.21%\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8fbe94.76%\uff1b\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636eF1\u4e3a76.77%\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fbe85.78%\u3002", "conclusion": "CLUE\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper focuses on the advantages of this formulation in terms of scalability through parallelization, highlighting its computational benefits compared to conventional methods based on waypoint tracking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u8986\u76d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e76\u884c\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8986\u76d6\u89c4\u5212\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cSinkhorn\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u8026\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u5408\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e76\u884c\u5316\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u5f84\u70b9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u8986\u76d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "PROMISE\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u56e0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPROMISE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u5f81", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ecf\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "PROMISE\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0e\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027"}}

However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation.

Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT).

Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing.

To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance.

However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \\textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types).

However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method.

Code will be available", "summary": "Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with \"the right to be forgotten\" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGraphToxin\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u56fe\u91cd\u6784\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u5220\u9664\u8282\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u5173\u8054\u7684\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u65e0\u6548\u751a\u81f3\u52a0\u5267\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u867d\u65e8\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6b8b\u7559\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u88ab\u653b\u51fb\u6062\u590d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u771f\u5b9e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u66f2\u7387\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5355\u8282\u70b9\u4e0e\u591a\u8282\u70b9\u5220\u9664\u4e0b\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u4e0e\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "GraphToxin\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u5220\u9664\u8282\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u751a\u81f3\u589e\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes.

To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling.

However, slow sampling speed is an essential challenge for recent developed DM-based schemes. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel flow matching (FM)-based generative model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation. We first formulate the channel estimation problem within FM framework, where the conditional probability path is constructed from the noisy channel distribution to the true channel distribution. In this case, the path evolves along the straight-line trajectory at a constant speed. Then, guided by this, we derive the velocity field that depends solely on the noise statistics to guide generative models training. Furthermore, during the sampling phase, we utilize the trained velocity field as prior information for channel estimation, which allows for quick and reliable noise channel enhancement via ordinary differential equation (ODE) Euler solver. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FM-based channel estimation scheme can significantly reduce the sampling overhead compared to other popular DM-based schemes, such as the score matching (SM)-based scheme.

We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color.

This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks.

Under review", "summary": "Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes.

Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9c81\u68d2\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08URDA\uff09\u6846\u67b6DART\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u590d\u6742\u4fee\u6539\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709UDA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfVAT\u5728UDA\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faURDA\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0eDART\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3UDA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u84b8\u998f\u8fdb\u884c\u77ac\u65f6\u9c81\u68d2\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1DART\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5efa\u7acbURDA\u7406\u8bba\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "DART\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u9c81\u68d2\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3aUDA\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5316\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6846\u67b6\uff08NCMP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3aGNN\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012GNN\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8282\u70b9\u4e0e\u5355\u4e2a\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNCMP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1SINC-GCN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5176\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u540c\u6784\u65b9\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u90bb\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86SINC-GCN\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86NCMP\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NCMP\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u7ecf\u5178GNN\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a8\u5e7f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data.

Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method.

However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08HGC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u9700\u5904\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\uff08\u5757\u7ea7\uff09\u91cd\u7528\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\uff09\u91cd\u7528\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u76f8\u90bb\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO-Stuff\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1163%\uff0818.22T\u21926.70T\uff09\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u4f4e\u4e8e1.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "HGC\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps.

However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty.

However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks.

We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting.

However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes.

Supplementary material included after references. 27 pages, 21 figures, 11 tables", "summary": "4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency.

Chamon"], "title": "Adaptive Symmetrization of the KL Divergence", "comment": null, "summary": "Many tasks in machine learning can be described as or reduced to learning a probability distribution given a finite set of samples. A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence.

Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+\u03b4$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality.

This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges.

The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants.

To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \\textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \\textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \\textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \\textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \\textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization.

Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization.

Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u566a\u58f0\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5ab2\u7f8e\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u6570\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u8fbe\u6210\u5171\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u90e8\u52063D\u6570\u636e\uff09\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56e0\u679c\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5927\u91cf\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u76f8\u540c\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u6839\u636e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u8865\u5168\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u800c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2.

However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points.

For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets.

We explore sparse convolutional networks for representation learning on TPC data, finding that a sparse ResNet architecture, even with randomly set weights, provides useful structured vector embeddings of events. Pre-training this architecture on a simple physics-motivated binary classification task further improves the embedding quality. Using data from the GAseous Detector with GErmanium Tagging (GADGET) II TPC, a detector optimized for measuring low-energy $\u03b2$-delayed particle decays, we represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, train Minkowski Engine ResNet models, and probe the resulting event-level embeddings which reveal rich event structure. As a cross-detector test, we embed data from the Active-Target TPC (AT-TPC) -- a detector designed for nuclear reaction studies in inverse kinematics -- using the same encoder. We find that even an untrained sparse ResNet model provides useful embeddings of AT-TPC data, and we observe improvements when the model is trained on GADGET data.

Under review for MIDL 2026", "summary": "Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u91cd\u5efaX\u5149\u7247\uff08DRRs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9499\u5316\uff08CAC\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9eX\u5149\u7247\u76f8\u5f53\u7684AUC 0.754\u3002", "motivation": "CT\u626b\u63cf\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e0d\u9002\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u800c\u771f\u5b9eX\u5149\u7247\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u5c55\uff1bDRRs\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u5e26\u7cbe\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eCOCA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684667\u4f8bCT\u751f\u6210DRRs\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8f7b\u91cfCNN\u4ece\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387+\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578bAUC\u8fbe0.754\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5f80X\u5149\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "DRRs\u662f\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684CAC\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5411\u771f\u5b9eX\u5149\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This paper proposes a few-shot learning approach leveraging contrastive learning to detect bark beetle infestations using satellite PRISMA hyperspectral data. The methodology is based on a contrastive learning framework to pre-train a one-dimensional CNN encoder, enabling the extraction of robust feature representations from hyperspectral data. These extracted features are subsequently utilized as input to support vector regression estimators, one for each class, trained on few labeled samples to estimate the proportions of healthy, attacked by bark beetle, and dead trees for each pixel.

However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices.

The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection.

While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5NASK\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "NASK\u7ed3\u5408Gower\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u6307\u6570\u53d8\u6362\u5efa\u6a21\u6570\u503c\u4e0e\u7c7b\u522b\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7Weisfeiler-Lehman\u8fed\u4ee3\u589e\u5f3a\u661f\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u90bb\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u548c4\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cNASK\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e16\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "NASK\u662f\u6b63\u5b9a\u56fe\u6838\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation.

Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "EHR\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4eba\u7fa4\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63d0\u53473-6\u500d\u5bcc\u96c6\u7387\uff0c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u764c\u75c7\u7b5b\u67e5\u6307\u5357\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528All of Us\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u4e2d86.5\u4e07\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684EHR\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u548c\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30EHR\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u56e0\u7a81\u53d8\u3001\u5bb6\u65cf\u53f2\uff09\u5bf98\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u764c\u75c7\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u80fd\u3002", "result": "EHR\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u7d20\u9ad83-6\u500d\u5bcc\u96c6\u7387\uff1bEHR\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u572826\u79cd\u764c\u75c7\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "EHR\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u764c\u75c7\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one.

It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality.

Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios.

Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states.

Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., \"Crack\" vs. \"Scratch\") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times.

However, most computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics encoded in their symbols. This prevents a truly deep understanding of critical biological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we present SemST, a semantic-guided deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics data clustering. SemST leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable genes to \"speak\" through their symbolic meanings, transforming gene sets within each tissue spot into biologically informed embeddings. These embeddings are then fused with the spatial neighborhood relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving a coherent integration of biological function and spatial structure. We further introduce the Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module to optimally exploit these biological priors. The FSM module learns spot-specific affine transformations that empower the semantic embeddings to perform an element-wise calibration of the spatial features, thus dynamically injecting high-order biological knowledge into the spatial context. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that SemST achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance.

On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities.

In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\\!7.5\\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \\ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs.

For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs.

Project Page- https://refine-align.github.io/", "summary": "In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAlignVQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fa9\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u5fae\u6821\u51c6\u635f\u5931aligncal\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728VQA\u4e2d\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6b63\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1AlignVQA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e13\u7528VLM\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fa9\u8bba\uff08\u6279\u5224\u3001\u4fee\u6b63\u3001\u805a\u5408\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u635f\u5931aligncal\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7406\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e13\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u8d8a\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8d8a\u51c6\u786e\uff0caligncal\u635f\u5931\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u4f53\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e0e\u53ef\u5fae\u6821\u51c6\u635f\u5931\u7ed3\u5408\u662f\u63d0\u5347VQA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u4e2a\u822a\u5929\u4efb\u52a1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RL\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e14\u589e\u52a0\u64cd\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Gated Transformer-XL\u67b6\u6784\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5355\u4e00\u5206\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u5904\u7406\u79d2\u81f3\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u706b\u7bad\u4e0a\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u52a8\u6001 regimes\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u514d\u9636\u6bb5\u5207\u6362\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u822a\u5929\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4e13\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002"}}

To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Viper-F1 \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u9ad8\u6548 Liquid \u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u4ee3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0cTransformer \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 Liquid \u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u4ee3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1 Token-Grid \u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 FiLM \u6761\u4ef6\u8c03\u5236\u72b6\u6001\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cViper-F1 \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Viper-F1 \u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.\n  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\\mathcal C$ and any predictor $\u03b3$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\\hat \u03b3$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\\hat \u03b3$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $\u03b3$.

Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data.

A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 \u03bcm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns.

While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.\n  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data.

We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision.

However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data.

However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption.

However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Abdallah", "Telmo M. Silva Filho"], "title": "Epistemic Error Decomposition for Multi-step Time Series Forecasting: Rethinking Bias-Variance in Recursive and Direct Strategies", "comment": "2025 EIML Eurips Workshop, 6 pages", "summary": "Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error.

Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM.

Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones.

In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data.

Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research.

We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets.

However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process.

Despite achieving impressive accuracy on benchmarks, these models produce confident hallucinations, even when wrong answers carry catastrophic consequences. Our evaluations on GSM8K, MedQA and GPQA show frontier models almost never abstain despite explicit warnings of severe penalties, suggesting that prompts cannot override training that rewards any answer over no answer. As a remedy, we propose Reinforced Hesitation (RH): a modification to Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to use ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstention, -$\u03bb$ error) instead of binary. Controlled experiments on logic puzzles reveal that varying $\u03bb$ produces distinct models along a Pareto frontier, where each training penalty yields the optimal model for its corresponding risk regime: low penalties produce aggressive answerers, high penalties conservative abstainers. We then introduce two inference strategies that exploit trained abstention as a coordination signal: cascading routes queries through models with decreasing risk tolerance, while self-cascading re-queries the same model on abstention. Both outperform majority voting with lower computational cost. These results establish abstention as a first-class training objective that transforms ``I don't know'' from failure into a coordination signal, enabling models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5316\u72b9\u8c6b\uff08RH\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5143\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u5b66\u4f1a\u6c89\u9ed8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u4ecd\u81ea\u4fe1\u4f5c\u7b54\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u540e\u679c\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4f1a\u4f55\u65f6\u4e0d\u5e94\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "method": "\u6539\u8fdbRLVR\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5143\u5956\u52b1\uff08+1\u6b63\u786e\uff0c0 abstention\uff0c-$\u03bb$\u9519\u8bef\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea7\u8054\u548c\u81ea\u7ea7\u8054\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c$\u03bb$\u503c\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u9669\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ea7\u8054\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u3002", "conclusion": " abstention \u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bda\u5b9e\u627f\u8ba4\u5c40\u9650\u6765\u8d62\u5f97\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002"}}

To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an \"Embedding-as-Value\" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes.

Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior \"vision-mamba\" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline.

As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \\emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.\n  In this work, we generalize the study of the \\emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al.

This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module.

Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "CountSteer \u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9075\u5faa\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u9690\u542b\u5bf9\u6570\u91cf\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa CountSteer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u6821\u6b63\u5bf9\u8c61\u6570\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u8c61\u6570\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea6 4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5df2\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u91cf\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices.

It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects.

However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines.

However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $\u03a6$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors.

While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details.

Code: https://github.com/HaokunChen245/AUVIC", "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting.

Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace\" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "BOFA\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u8c03\u6574CLIP\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6865\u63a5\u5c42\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CLIP\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u6dfb\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "BOFA\u4ec5\u5728CLIP\u7684\u6865\u63a5\u5c42\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u4f4e\u79e9\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b89\u5168\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u539f\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cBOFA\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u6865\u63a5\u5c42\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u539f\u578b\uff0cBOFA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3aCLIP\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts.

However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles.

Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($\u03bc$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures.

Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity.

Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels.

We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher\" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student\" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\\%.

First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%.

However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing.

This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6587\u5316\u610f\u8c61\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u8f6c\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u590d\u5236\u8fd8\u91cd\u6784\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e76\u8f6c\u5316\u6587\u5316\u5171\u901a\u610f\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u79bb\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e767\u4e2aWikidata\u6587\u5316\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u793a\u6270\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6587\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u53d7\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u3001\u6587\u672c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3001\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u548c\u521b\u4f5c\u65f6\u95f4\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5728\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u8f6c\u5316\u4e0e\u91cd\u65b0\u8bed\u5883\u5316\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e94\u8d85\u8d8a\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8fc8\u5411\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity.

Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale.

However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u504f\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u6837\u7269\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u989c\u8272\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65e0\u504f\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u524d\u6cbfVLMs\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u5728COCO\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347VLMs\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMaMOL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e13\u5bb6\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u5e94\u5bf9\u9065\u611f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u5047\u8bbe\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "method": "MaMOL\u5c06\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u7531\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a-\u5171\u4eab\u9759\u6001\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MaMOL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5907\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability).

To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery.

In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "ImAgent\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u5199\u3001\u6700\u4f73N\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u867d\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u5757\u4e14\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faImAgent\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e76\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cImAgent\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u6548\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens.

However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning.

Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities \"think\". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.

Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts.

However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/", "AI": {"tldr": "LARM \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e Transformer \u7684\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u91cd\u5efa\u4e09\u7ef4\u5173\u8282\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bc6\u96c6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u800c\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u51e0\u4f55\u7c97\u7cd9\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7eb9\u7406\u91cd\u5efa\u4e14\u7ba1\u9053\u590d\u6742\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "method": "LARM \u6269\u5c55\u4e86 LVSM \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7 Transformer \u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u4e0e\u5173\u8282\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u548c\u90e8\u4ef6\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u663e\u5f0f\u7f51\u683c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5173\u8282\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "LARM \u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u5408\u6210\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u5173\u8282\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfmesh\u5e76\u7d27\u5bc6\u8d34\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "LARM \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e09\u7ef4\u5173\u8282\u5bf9\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}
