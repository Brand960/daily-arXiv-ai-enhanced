The core methodology involves leveraging semantic information from image captions during model training to improve generalization capabilities. Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing the pivotal challenge of demographic bias in gender classification from facial images. Furthermore, this technique operates in the absence of demographic labels and is application agnostic.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u63d0\u5347\u9762\u90e8\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u53e3\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u89c1", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9762\u90e8\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u5339\u914d\uff08ITM\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u5f81", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700 demographic labels\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027", "conclusion": "\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u89c2\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u4e14\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55"}}

To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR), a framework that controllably synthesizes images and corresponding text, specifically: realistic retinal vasculature with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) features: capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, and tortuosity, while automatically generating granular reasoning texts.

Our experiments show that a general-purpose VLM (Qwen3-VL-8b) trained on the dataset achieves a zero-shot balanced classification accuracy of 89.67% on real OCTA images, outperforming supervised baselines.

Yet existing approaches, modular or end-to-end, are deficient in manipulation-aware locomotion. This confines the robot to a limited workspace, preventing it from performing large-space loco-manipulation. We attribute this to: (1) the challenge of acquiring loco-manipulation knowledge due to the scarcity of humanoid teleoperation data, and (2) the difficulty of faithfully and reliably executing locomotion commands, stemming from the limited precision and stability of existing RL controllers. To acquire richer loco-manipulation knowledge, we propose a unified latent learning framework that enables Vision-Language-Action (VLA) system to learn from low-cost action-free egocentric videos. Moreover, an efficient human data collection pipeline is devised to augment the dataset and scale the benefits. To more precisely execute the desired locomotion commands, we present a loco-manipulation-oriented (LMO) RL policy specifically tailored for accurate and stable core loco-manipulation movements, such as advancing, turning, and squatting. Building on these components, we introduce WholeBodyVLA, a unified framework for humanoid loco-manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, WholeBodyVLA is one of its kind enabling large-space humanoid loco-manipulation.

Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale.

We introduce VDAWorld, a framework where a Vision-Language Model (VLM) acts as an intelligent agent to orchestrate this process. The VLM autonomously constructs a grounded (2D or 3D) scene representation by selecting from a suite of vision tools, and accordingly chooses a compatible physics simulator (e.g., rigid body, fluid) to act upon it. VDAWorld can then infer latent dynamics from the static scene to predict plausible future states.

This paper surveys how the landscape of urban dynamics studying has evolved with a particular focus on event-based cameras. Event-based cameras capture changes in light intensity instead of the RGB values that traditional cameras do. They offer unique abilities, like the ability to work in low-light, that can make them advantageous compared to other sensors. Through an analysis of event-based cameras, their applications, their advantages and challenges, and machine learning applications, we propose event-based cameras as a medium for capturing information to study urban dynamics. They offer the ability to capture important information while maintaining privacy. We also suggest multi-sensor fusion of event-based cameras and other sensors in the study of urban dynamics.

The proposed method simultaneously handles multiple position and velocity constraints through an explicit closed-form control law, eliminating the need to solve a Quadratic Program (QP) at every control step and enabling efficient real-time implementation. This letter derives necessary and sufficient conditions under which the closed-form expression remains non-singular, thereby ensuring well-posedness of the CBF solution to multi-constraint problem. The controller is validated in both simulation and hardware experiments on a custom-built Stewart platform prototype, demonstrating safetyguaranteed performance that is comparable to the QP-based formulation, while reducing computation time by more than an order of magnitude.

Infrared cameras provide complementary advantages in such environments. Simultaneously, supervised AI systems require large labeled datasets, which makes zero-shot learning frameworks more practical for applications including infrared cameras. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) offer a new path in zero-shot predictions from paired image-text representations. However, current VLMs cannot understand infrared camera data since they are trained on RGB data. This work introduces VLM-IRIS (Vision-Language Models for InfraRed Industrial Sensing), a zero-shot framework that adapts VLMs to infrared data by preprocessing infrared images captured by a FLIR Boson sensor into RGB-compatible inputs suitable for CLIP-based encoders. We demonstrate zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed where temperature differences between the build plate and workpieces make the task well-suited for thermal imaging. VLM-IRIS converts the infrared images to magma representation and applies centroid prompt ensembling with a CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder to achieve high accuracy on infrared images without any model retraining.

Most of the RGB-based navigation systems only guarantee coarse, meter-level accuracy, making them less suitable for the precise positioning phase of mobile manipulation. This gap prevents manipulation policies from operating within the distribution of their training demonstrations, resulting in frequent execution failures. We address this gap by introducing an object-centric imitation learning framework for last-meter navigation, enabling a quadruped mobile manipulator robot to achieve manipulation-ready positioning using only RGB observations from its onboard cameras. Our method conditions the navigation policy on three inputs: goal images, multi-view RGB observations from the onboard cameras, and a text prompt specifying the target object. A language-driven segmentation module and a spatial score-matrix decoder then supply explicit object grounding and relative pose reasoning. Using real-world data from a single object instance within a category, the system generalizes to unseen object instances across diverse environments with challenging lighting and background conditions. To comprehensively evaluate this, we introduce two metrics: an edge-alignment metric, which uses ground truth orientation, and an object-alignment metric, which evaluates how well the robot visually faces the target. Under these metrics, our policy achieves 73.47% success in edge-alignment and 96.94% success in object-alignment when positioning relative to unseen target objects. These results show that precise last-meter navigation can be achieved at a category-level without depth, LiDAR, or map priors, enabling a scalable pathway toward unified mobile manipulation.

In contrast, we propose VGent, a modular encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly disentangles high-level reasoning and low-level bounding box prediction. Specifically, a frozen MLLM serves as the encoder to provide untouched powerful reasoning capabilities, while a decoder takes high-quality boxes proposed by detectors as queries and selects target box(es) via cross-attending on encoder's hidden states. This design fully leverages advances in both object detection and MLLM, avoids the pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, and enables fast inference. Moreover, it supports modular upgrades of both the encoder and decoder to benefit the whole system: we introduce (i) QuadThinker, an RL-based training paradigm for enhancing multi-target reasoning ability of the encoder; (ii) mask-aware label for resolving detection-segmentation ambiguity; and (iii) global target recognition to improve the recognition of all the targets which benefits the selection among augmented proposals.

While co-training with external reasoning data helps, it requires experienced tuning and data-related overhead. Beyond such external dependencies, we identify an intrinsic cause within VLA datasets: modality imbalance, where language diversity is much lower than visual and action diversity. This imbalance biases the model toward visual shortcuts and language forgetting. To address this, we introduce BayesVLA, a Bayesian factorization that decomposes the policy into a visual-action prior, supporting seeing-to-act, and a language-conditioned likelihood, enabling prompt-to-specify. This inherently preserves generalization and promotes instruction following. We further incorporate pre- and post-contact phases to better leverage pre-trained foundation models. Information-theoretic analysis formally validates our effectiveness in mitigating shortcut learning. Extensive experiments show superior generalization to unseen instructions, objects, and environments compared to existing methods.

While there are similarities in the pre-training objectives of FMs, there is still limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, or biological interpretation of features. In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions.

We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \\textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets.

LEGO converts this unsupervised challenge into a tractable pseudo-supervised one. First, we obtain initial restorations from the pre-trained model.

Third, we fine-tune the original model using a mixed-supervision strategy combining in-distribution data with these new pseudo-pairs.

We introduce a new family of monotonically improving policy-iteration algorithms that alternate between single-stage output-based policy improvements and policy evaluations according to a prescribed periodic pattern. We show that this family admits optimal patterns that maximize a natural computational-efficiency index, and we identify the simplest pattern with minimal period.

We employ a divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy with three components: (1) knowledge distillation to compress the hybrid backbone into a single efficient student; (2) blockwise neural architecture search for automatically discovering optimal cost filtering designs under latency budgets, reducing search complexity exponentially; and (3) structured pruning for eliminating redundancy in the iterative refinement module. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline used to curate 1.4M in-the-wild stereo pairs to supplement synthetic training data and facilitate knowledge distillation.

In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $\u03b1,\u03b2$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Clip-and-Verify is part of the $\u03b1,\u03b2$-CROWN verifier (http://abcrown.org), the VNN-COMP 2025 winner.

However, many visual domains, especially non-object-centric domains such as medical imaging and remote sensing, contain itemized text annotations: multiple text items describing distinct and semantically independent findings within a single image.

Here, we introduce ItemizedCLIP, a framework for learning complete and explainable visual representations from itemized text supervision. ItemizedCLIP employs a cross-attention module to produce text item-conditioned visual embeddings and a set of tailored objectives that jointly enforce item independence (distinct regions for distinct items) and representation completeness (coverage of all items). Across four domains with naturally itemized text supervision (brain MRI, head CT, chest CT, remote sensing) and one additional synthetically itemized dataset, ItemizedCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot performance and fine-grained interpretability over baselines.

Scenario-based testing is a prominent approach to addressing this challenge, as it involves the systematic simulation of objects and environments. Operational Design Domains (ODDs) are usually described using a taxonomy of qualitative designations for individual objects. However, the process of transitioning from taxonomy to concrete test cases remains unstructured, and completeness is theoretical. This paper introduces a structured method of subdividing the ODD into manageable sections, termed micro-ODDs (mODDs), and deriving test cases with abstract object representations. This concept is demonstrated using a one-dimensional, laterally guided manoeuvre involving a shunting locomotive within a constrained ODD. In this example, mODDs are defined and refined into narrow taxonomies that enable test case generation. Obstacles are represented as generic cubes of varying sizes, providing a simplified yet robust means of evaluating perception performance. A series of tests were conducted in a closed-loop, co-simulated virtual environment featuring photorealistic rendering and simulated LiDAR, GNSS and camera sensors. The results demonstrate how edge cases in obstacle detection can be systematically explored and how perception quality can be evaluated based on observed vehicle behaviour, using crash versus safe stop as the outcome metrics.

However, current ECG models are trained under the assumption of clean and non-ambiguous annotations, which limits both the development and the meaningful evaluation of models under real-world conditions. Although Partial Label Learning (PLL) frameworks are designed to learn from ambiguous labels, their effectiveness in medical time-series domains, ECG in particular, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of PLL methods for ECG diagnosis. We adapt nine PLL algorithms to multi-label ECG diagnosis and evaluate them using a diverse set of clinically motivated ambiguity generation strategies, capturing both unstructured (e.g., random) and structured ambiguities (e.g., cardiologist-derived similarities, treatment relationships, and diagnostic taxonomies). Our experiments on the PTB-XL and Chapman datasets demonstrate that PLL methods vary substantially in their robustness to different types and degrees of ambiguity. Through extensive analysis, we identify key limitations of current PLL approaches in clinical settings and outline future directions for developing robust and clinically aligned ambiguity-aware learning frameworks for ECG diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8bca\u65ad\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5047\u8bbe\u6807\u7b7e\u7eaf\u51c0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8131\u79bb\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "method": "\u9002\u914d9\u79cd\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u81f3\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u968f\u673a\u3001\u533b\u751f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u6cbb\u7597\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u7b49\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728PTB-XL\u548cChapman\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540cPLL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%.

In particular, infrastructure-assisted CP, where sensor units are mounted on infrastructure elements such as traffic lights or lamp posts, can help overcome perceptual limitations by providing enhanced points of view, which significantly reduces occlusions. To encourage decision makers to adopt this technology, comprehensive studies and datasets demonstrating safety improvements for VRUs are essential. In this paper, we propose a framework for evaluating the safety improvement by infrastructure-based CP specifically targeted at VRUs including a dataset with safety-critical EuroNCAP scenarios (CarlaNCAP) with 11k frames. Using this dataset, we conduct an in-depth simulation study and demonstrate that infrastructure-assisted CP can significantly reduce accident rates in safety-critical scenarios, achieving up to 100% accident avoidance compared to a vehicle equipped with sensors with only 33%.

Multi-objective Bayesian optimization is a promising solution for such expensive, black-box problems: it fits probabilistic surrogates and selects new designs via an acquisition function that balances exploration and exploitation. In practice, it requires tailored choices of surrogate and acquisition that rarely transfer to the next problem, is myopic when multi-step planning is often required, and adds refitting overhead, particularly in parallel or time-sensitive loops. We present TAMO, a fully amortized, universal policy for multi-objective black-box optimization. TAMO uses a transformer architecture that operates across varying input and objective dimensions, enabling pretraining on diverse corpora and transfer to new problems without retraining: at test time, the pretrained model proposes the next design with a single forward pass. We pretrain the policy with reinforcement learning to maximize cumulative hypervolume improvement over full trajectories, conditioning on the entire query history to approximate the Pareto frontier. Across synthetic benchmarks and real tasks, TAMO produces fast proposals, reducing proposal time by 50-1000x versus alternatives while matching or improving Pareto quality under tight evaluation budgets.

Previous TAMP algorithms have focused mainly on computational performance, completeness, or optimality by making the problem tractable through simplifications and abstractions. However, this comes at the cost of the resulting plans potentially failing to account for the dynamics or complex contacts necessary to reliably perform the task when object manipulation is required. Additionally, approaches that ignore effects of the low-level controllers may not obtain optimal or feasible plan realizations for the real system. We investigate the use of a GPU-parallelized physics simulator to compute realizations of plans with motion controllers, explicitly accounting for dynamics, and considering contacts with the environment. Using cross-entropy optimization, we sample the parameters of the controllers, or actions, to obtain low-cost solutions. Since our approach uses the same controllers as the real system, the robot can directly execute the computed plans. We demonstrate our approach for a set of tasks where the robot is able to exploit the environment's geometry to move an object.

While traditional optimization solvers provide optimal solutions, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for large-scale systems requiring frequent recalculations. Machine learning approaches offer promise for acceleration but often struggle with constraint satisfaction and cost optimality. We present a novel two-stage learning framework that combines physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Continuous Flow Matching (CFM) for solving DC-OPF problems. Our approach embeds fundamental physical principles--including economic dispatch optimality conditions, Kirchhoff's laws, and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) complementarity conditions--directly into the training objectives. The first stage trains a GNN to produce feasible initial solutions by learning from physics-informed losses that encode power system constraints. The second stage employs CFM, a simulation-free continuous normalizing flow technique, to refine these solutions toward optimality through learned vector field regression. Evaluated on the IEEE 30-bus system across five load scenarios ranging from 70\\% to 130\\% nominal load, our method achieves near-optimal solutions with cost gaps below 0.1\\% for nominal loads and below 3\\% for extreme conditions, while maintaining 100\\% feasibility.

With the emergence of 3D generation, this task has undergone a transformative impact, shifting not only from visual fidelity to functional utility but also enabling editable CAD designs. Prior works have achieved early success in single-part CAD generation, which is not well-suited for real-world applications, as multiple parts need to be assembled under semantic and geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose CADKnitter, a compositional CAD generation framework with a geometry-guided diffusion sampling strategy. CADKnitter is able to generate a complementary CAD part that follows both the geometric constraints of the given CAD model and the semantic constraints of the desired design text prompt. We also curate a dataset, so-called KnitCAD, containing over 310,000 samples of CAD models, along with textual prompts and assembly metadata that provide semantic and geometric constraints.

Although some studies have attempted to bridge this gap using reinforcement learning, they remain confined to merely reproducing human manipulation, resulting in limited task performance. In this paper, we propose UniBYD, a unified framework that uses a dynamic reinforcement learning algorithm to discover manipulation policies aligned with the robot's physical characteristics. To enable consistent modeling across diverse robotic hand morphologies, UniBYD incorporates a unified morphological representation (UMR). Building on UMR, we design a dynamic PPO with an annealed reward schedule, enabling reinforcement learning to transition from imitation of human demonstrations to explore policies adapted to diverse robotic morphologies better, thereby going beyond mere imitation of human hands. To address the frequent failures of learning human priors in the early training stage, we design a hybrid Markov-based shadow engine that enables reinforcement learning to imitate human manipulations in a fine-grained manner. To evaluate UniBYD comprehensively, we propose UniManip, the first benchmark encompassing robotic manipulation tasks spanning multiple hand morphologies.

In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFairOBD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e regret \u548c\u6709\u754c\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u957f\u671f\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "FairOBD\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u5c06\u957f\u671f\u516c\u5e73\u6210\u672c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u964d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u547d\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u516c\u5e73\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eFairOBD\u5728T\u2192\u221e\u65f6\u5bf9\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u79bb\u7ebf\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u51c6\u5177\u6709\u6e10\u8fd1\u6709\u754c\u7ade\u4e89\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728AI\u63a8\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u603b\u516c\u5e73\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "FairOBD\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u793e\u4f1a\u8d1f\u8d23\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Yet there remains room for improvement in their sample fidelity. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass.

Classic Artificial Intelligence techniques for this purpose, focusing on symbolic approaches, have long-ago hit the scalability wall on compute and memory costs. Advances in Large Language Models in the past decade (neural approaches) have resulted in unprecedented displays of capability, at the cost of control, explainability, and interpretability. Large Action Models aim at extending Large Language Models to encompass the full perception, reasoning, and action cycle; however, they typically require substantially more comprehensive training and suffer from the same deficiencies in reliability. Here, we show it is possible to build competent Large Action Models by composing off-the-shelf foundation models, and that their control, interpretability, and explainability can be effected by incorporating symbolic wrappers and associated verification on their outputs, achieving verifiable neuro-symbolic solutions for intelligent robots. Our experiments on a multi-modal robot demonstrate that Large Action Model intelligence does not require massive end-to-end training, but can be achieved by integrating efficient perception models with a logic-driven core. We find that driving action execution through the generation of Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) code enables a human-in-the-loop verification stage that effectively mitigates action hallucinations.

In this work, we introduce a benchmark, called SmokeBench, to evaluate the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to recognize and localize wildfire smoke in images. The benchmark consists of four tasks: (1) smoke classification, (2) tile-based smoke localization, (3) grid-based smoke localization, and (4) smoke detection. We evaluate several MLLMs, including Idefics2, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, Unified-IO 2, Grounding DINO, GPT-4o, and Gemini-2.5 Pro. Our results show that while some models can classify the presence of smoke when it covers a large area, all models struggle with accurate localization, especially in the early stages.

Dimensionality reduction techniques and autoencoders are powerful tools for extracting features, but they often struggle with such high-dimensional data. This paper presents an enhanced autoencoder framework that incorporates a clustering loss, based on the soft silhouette score, alongside a contrastive loss to improve the visualization and interpretability of ensemble datasets. First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space.

Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities. Our results suggest that stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5728VFM\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u6cd5\u7ebf\u548cRGB\u7b49\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728VFM\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u662f\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u524d\u666f\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u77f3\u3002"}}

We aim to address complex urban problems across multiple domains and localities by harnessing the rich information over 50 data sources. Specifically, our data-learning module integrates homophily from spatial-varying dataset into graph-learning, embedding information of various localities into models. We demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of the framework through five real-world observations using a variety of publicly accessible datasets (e.g., ride-share, traffic crash, and crime reports) collected from multiple cities.

However, exclusive reliance on the current scene for motion planning may result in suboptimal responses in highly dynamic traffic environments where ego actions further alter the future scene. To model the evolution of future scenes, we leverage the World Model to represent how the ego vehicle and its environment interact and change over time, which entails complex reasoning. The Chain of Thought (CoT) offers a promising solution by forecasting a sequence of future thoughts that subsequently guide trajectory refinement. In this paper, we propose FutureX, a CoT-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning via future scene latent reasoning and trajectory refinement. Specifically, the Auto-think Switch examines the current scene and decides whether additional reasoning is required to yield a higher-quality motion plan. Once FutureX enters the Thinking mode, the Latent World Model conducts a CoT-guided rollout to predict future scene representation, enabling the Summarizer Module to further refine the motion plan. Otherwise, FutureX operates in an Instant mode to generate motion plans in a forward pass for relatively simple scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FutureX enhances existing methods by producing more rational motion plans and fewer collisions without compromising efficiency, thereby achieving substantial overall performance gains, e.g., 6.2 PDMS improvement for TransFuser on NAVSIM.

While recent methods excel at learning sparse coordination graphs-determining who communicates with whom-they do not address what information should be transmitted under hard bandwidth constraints. We study this bandwidth-limited regime and show that naive dimensionality reduction consistently degrades coordination performance. Hard bandwidth constraints force selective encoding, but deterministic projections lack mechanisms to control how compression occurs. We introduce Bandwidth-constrained Variational Message Encoding (BVME), a lightweight module that treats messages as samples from learned Gaussian posteriors regularized via KL divergence to an uninformative prior. BVME's variational framework provides principled, tunable control over compression strength through interpretable hyperparameters, directly constraining the representations used for decision-making. Across SMACv1, SMACv2, and MPE benchmarks, BVME achieves comparable or superior performance while using 67--83% fewer message dimensions, with gains most pronounced on sparse graphs where message quality critically impacts coordination.

In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive generation and enhance temporal consistency, which leverages a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the training of the streaming student model. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, demonstrating substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation.

To address this, we propose ProbeMDE, a cost-aware active sensing framework that combines RGB images with sparse proprioceptive measurements for MDE. Our approach utilizes an ensemble of MDE models to predict dense depth maps conditioned on both RGB images and on a sparse set of known depth measurements obtained via proprioception, where the robot has touched the environment in a known configuration. We quantify predictive uncertainty via the ensemble's variance and measure the gradient of the uncertainty with respect to candidate measurement locations. To prevent mode collapse while selecting maximally informative locations to propriocept (touch), we leverage Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) over this gradient map. We validate our method in both simulated and physical experiments on central airway obstruction surgical phantoms.

The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems.

In addition to improved sim-to-real transfer, the multi-agent policies also exhibit some degree of generalization to opponents unseen at training time.

Like any machine learning problem, the choice of activation function influences the characteristics and performance of the solution obtained from physics-informed training. Several studies have compared common activation functions on benchmark differential equations, and have unanimously found that the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is outperformed by competitors such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and swish activation functions. In this work, we diagnose the poor performance of ReLU on physics-informed machine learning problems. While it is well-known that the piecewise linear form of ReLU prevents it from being used on second-order differential equations, we show that ReLU fails even on variational problems involving only first derivatives. We identify the cause of this failure as second derivatives of the activation, which are taken not in the formulation of the loss, but in the process of training.

We propose WildCap, a novel method for high-quality facial appearance capture from a smartphone video recorded in the wild. To disentangle high-quality reflectance from complex lighting effects in in-the-wild captures, we propose a novel hybrid inverse rendering framework. Specifically, we first apply a data-driven method, i.e., SwitchLight, to convert the captured images into more constrained conditions and then adopt model-based inverse rendering. However, unavoidable local artifacts in network predictions, such as shadow-baking, are non-physical and thus hinder accurate inverse rendering of lighting and material. To address this, we propose a novel texel grid lighting model to explain non-physical effects as clean albedo illuminated by local physical lighting. During optimization, we jointly sample a diffusion prior for reflectance maps and optimize the lighting, effectively resolving scale ambiguity between local lights and albedo. Our method achieves significantly better results than prior arts in the same capture setup, closing the quality gap between in-the-wild and controllable recordings by a large margin.

While generative models present an attractive solution, existing methods often alter only visual appearances without creating new behaviors, or suffer from embodiment inconsistencies that yield implausible motions. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorDream, an embodiment-aware world model that repurposes pretrained video diffusion models for robot data synthesis. AnchorDream conditions the diffusion process on robot motion renderings, anchoring the embodiment to prevent hallucination while synthesizing objects and environments consistent with the robot's kinematics. Starting from only a handful of human teleoperation demonstrations, our method scales them into large, diverse, high-quality datasets without requiring explicit environment modeling. Experiments show that the generated data leads to consistent improvements in downstream policy learning, with relative gains of 36.4% in simulator benchmarks and nearly double performance in real-world studies.

While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.\n  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction.

To address this issue, we devise a novel Cross-modal Prompting (ComP) method, which emphasizes coherent information by enhancing modality-specific features and improves the overall recognition accuracy by boosting each modality's performance. Specifically, a progressive prompt generation module with a dynamic gradient modulator is proposed to produce concise and consistent modality semantic cues. Meanwhile, cross-modal knowledge propagation selectively amplifies the consistent information in modality features with the delivered prompts to enhance the discrimination of the modality-specific output.

We make an attempt by studying rank constraints, which, as a generalization to conditional independence constraints, exploits the ranks of covariance submatrices in linear Gaussian models. We show that although selection can significantly complicate the joint distribution, interestingly, the ranks in the biased covariance matrices still preserve meaningful information about both causal structures and selection mechanisms.

An Experimental Comparison with Vision Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformers have recently demonstrated strong performance in computer vision, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) leveraging self-attention to capture both low-level and high-level image features. However, standard ViTs remain computationally expensive, since global self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which limits their practicality for high-resolution inputs and resource-constrained settings.\n  In this work, we investigate the Reformer architecture as an alternative vision backbone. By combining patch-based tokenization with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention, our model approximates global self-attention while reducing its theoretical time complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ in the sequence length $n$. We evaluate the proposed Reformer-based vision model on CIFAR-10 to assess its behavior on small-scale datasets, on ImageNet-100 to study its accuracy--efficiency trade-off in a more realistic setting, and on a high-resolution medical imaging dataset to evaluate the model under longer token sequences.\n  While the Reformer achieves higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to our ViT-style baseline, the ViT model consistently outperforms the Reformer in our experiments in terms of practical efficiency and end-to-end computation time across the larger and higher-resolution settings.

While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5ffd\u7565\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7b49\u53d8\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7fa4\u4e0d\u53d8\u6f5c\u5728\u566a\u58f0MDP\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7b49\u53d8\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u4ef7\u503c\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u88ab\u7834\u574f\u65f6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u53d8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand. We extend the framework with sublinear freeze scheduling, where freeze duration grows sublinearly with repeated low-importance detections, preventing over-aggressive compression.

Serrated tussock (\\textit{Nassella trichotoma}) is a highly competitive invasive grass species that disrupts native grasslands, reduces pasture productivity, and increases land management costs. In Victoria, Australia, it presents a major challenge due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact. While current ground surveys and subsequent management practices are effective at small scales, they are not feasible for landscape-scale monitoring. Although aerial imagery offers high spatial resolution suitable for detailed classification, its high cost limits scalability. Satellite-based remote sensing provides a more cost-effective and scalable alternative, though often with lower spatial resolution. This study evaluates whether multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, despite its lower spatial resolution, can provide a comparable and cost-effective alternative for landscape-scale monitoring of serrated tussock by leveraging its higher spectral resolution and seasonal phenological information. A total of eleven models have been developed using various combinations of spectral bands, texture features, vegetation indices, and seasonal data.

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

Traditional autoencoder-based methods often struggle with incomplete anomaly suppression and loss of fine details, as their single-pass decoding fails to effectively handle anomalies with varying severity and scale. We propose a recursive architecture for autoencoder (RcAE), which performs reconstruction iteratively to progressively suppress anomalies while refining normal structures. Unlike traditional single-pass models, this recursive design naturally produces a sequence of reconstructions, progressively exposing suppressed abnormal patterns. To leverage this reconstruction dynamics, we introduce a Cross Recursion Detection (CRD) module that tracks inconsistencies across recursion steps, enhancing detection of both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Additionally, we incorporate a Detail Preservation Network (DPN) to recover high-frequency textures typically lost during reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing non-diffusion methods, and achieves performance on par with recent diffusion models with only 10% of their parameters and offering substantially faster inference.

However, existing video autoencoders often entangle spatial and temporal information, limiting their ability to capture temporal consistency and leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose Autoregressive Video Autoencoder (ARVAE), which compresses and reconstructs each frame conditioned on its predecessor in an autoregressive manner, allowing flexible processing of videos with arbitrary lengths. ARVAE introduces a temporal-spatial decoupled representation that combines downsampled flow field for temporal coherence with spatial relative compensation for newly emerged content, achieving high compression efficiency without information loss. Specifically, the encoder compresses the current and previous frames into the temporal motion and spatial supplement, while the decoder reconstructs the original frame from the latent representations given the preceding frame. A multi-stage training strategy is employed to progressively optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARVAE achieves superior reconstruction quality with extremely lightweight models and small-scale training data.

Prior work in G-code verification uses Large-Language Models (LLMs), which primarily examine errors in the written programming. However, CNC machining requires extensive use and knowledge of the Human-Machine Interface (HMI), which displays machine status and errors. LLMs currently lack the capability to leverage knowledge of HMIs due to their inability to access the vision modality. This paper proposes a few-shot VLM-based verification approach that simultaneously evaluates the G-code and the HMI display for errors and safety status. The input dataset includes paired G-code text and associated HMI screenshots from a 15-slant-PRO lathe, including both correct and error-prone cases. To enable few-shot learning, the VLM is provided with a structured JSON schema based on prior heuristic knowledge. After determining the prompts, instances of G-code and HMI that either contain errors or are error free are used as few-shot examples to guide the VLM. The model was then evaluated in comparison to a zero-shot VLM through multiple scenarios of incorrect G-code and HMI errors with respect to per-slot accuracy. The VLM showed that few-shot prompting led to overall enhancement of detecting HMI errors and discrepancies with the G-code for more comprehensive debugging.

Their potential exposure to external world makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Existing detection methods against controller logic attacks use either specification-based or learnt models. However, specification-based models require experts' manual efforts or access to PLC's source code, while machine learning-based models often fall short of providing explanation for their decisions. We design SRLR -- a it Symbolic Regression based Logic Recovery} solution to identify the logic of a PLC based only on its inputs and outputs. The recovered logic is used to generate explainable rules for detecting controller logic attacks. SRLR enhances the latest deep symbolic regression methods using the following ICS-specific properties: (1) some important ICS control logic is best represented in frequency domain rather than time domain; (2) an ICS controller can operate in multiple modes, each using different logic, where mode switches usually do not happen frequently; (3) a robust controller usually filters out outlier inputs as ICS sensor data can be noisy; and (4) with the above factors captured, the degree of complexity of the formulas is reduced, making effective search possible. Thanks to these enhancements, SRLR consistently outperforms all existing methods in a variety of ICS settings that we evaluate. In terms of the recovery accuracy, SRLR's gain can be as high as 39% in some challenging environment. We also evaluate SRLR on a distribution grid containing hundreds of voltage regulators, demonstrating its stability in handling large-scale, complex systems with varied configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "SRLR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u7684PLC\u903b\u8f91\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u8bc6\u522b\u903b\u8f91\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89c4\u5219\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cdICS\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PLC\u903b\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u9ed1\u7bb1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u9700\u6e90\u7801\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "SRLR\u5229\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ICS\u7279\u6027\uff08\u9891\u57df\u8868\u793a\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u903b\u8f91\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "SRLR\u5728\u591a\u79cdICS\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534739%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5305\u542b\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u7535\u538b\u8c03\u8282\u5668\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SRLR\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165ICS\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684PLC\u903b\u8f91\u653b\u51fb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Quantum error correction (QEC) is vital for handling qubits, which are vulnerable to external noise. In QEC, actual errors are predicted from the results of syndrome measurements by stabilizer generators, in place of making direct measurements of the data qubits. Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u91cf\u5b50Golay\u7801\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8f83\u5c11\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6bd4\u73af\u9762\u7801\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6613\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea0\u9519\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQGEC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528Golay\u7801\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6743\u91cd\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u73af\u9762\u7801\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u4f4e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6743\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\uff1bGolay\u7801\uff0823\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb7\uff09\u4f18\u4e8e\u73af\u9762\u7801\uff0850\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb5\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u7ed3\u5408Golay\u7801\u53ef\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u73af\u9762\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, this process is hindered by low-quality input data caused by onboard sensors limited capability and frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete, noisy, or missing data, and thus reduced mapping accuracy and robustness. Recent efforts have introduced satellite images as auxiliary input, offering a stable, wide-area view to complement the limited ego perspective. However, satellite images in Bird's Eye View are often degraded by shadows and occlusions from vegetation and buildings. Prior methods using basic feature extraction and fusion remain ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SATMapTR, a novel online map construction model that effectively fuses satellite image through two key components: (1) a gated feature refinement module that adaptively filters satellite image features by integrating high-level semantics with low-level structural cues to extract high signal-to-noise ratio map-relevant representations; and (2) a geometry-aware fusion module that consistently fuse satellite and BEV features at a grid-to-grid level, minimizing interference from irrelevant regions and low-quality inputs. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that SATMapTR achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 73.8, outperforming state-of-the-art satellite-enhanced models by up to 14.2 mAP. It also shows lower mAP degradation under adverse weather and sensor failures, and achieves nearly 3 times higher mAP at extended perception ranges.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSATMapTR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523073.8 mAP\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5730\u56fe\u53d7\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5c40\u9650\u548c\u906e\u6321\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\uff1b\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u867d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e7f\u57df\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u906e\u6321\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSATMapTR\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u95e8\u63a7\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u878d\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\uff09\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u7f51\u683c\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u878d\u5408BEV\u4e0e\u536b\u661f\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6ee4\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u4e0amAP\u8fbe73.8\uff0c\u6bd4\u6700\u4f18\u536b\u661f\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9ad814.2\uff1b\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u4e0e\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5931\u6548\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u8303\u56f4\u6269\u5c55\u65f6mAP\u63d0\u5347\u8fd13\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "SATMapTR\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u5408\u536b\u661f\u4e0e\u8f66\u8f7d\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Existing datasets and methods mainly focus on speech-driven animation or unstructured expression sequences and therefore lack the semantic grounding and temporal structures needed for expressive human performance generation. In this work, we introduce KeyframeFace, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed for text-to-animation research through keyframe-level supervision. KeyframeFace provides 2,100 expressive scripts paired with monocular videos, per-frame ARKit coefficients, contextual backgrounds, complex emotions, manually defined keyframes, and multi-perspective annotations based on ARKit coefficients and images via Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Beyond the dataset, we propose the first text-to-animation framework that explicitly leverages LLM priors for interpretable facial motion synthesis. This design aligns the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs with the interpretable structure of ARKit's coefficients, enabling high-fidelity expressive animation. KeyframeFace and our LLM-based framework together establish a new foundation for interpretable, keyframe-guided, and context-aware text-to-animation.

Existing researches on flare removal have mainly focused on images, while the spatiotemporal characteristics of video flare remain largely unexplored. Video flare synthesis and removal pose significantly greater challenges than in image, owing to the complex and mutually independent motion of flare, light sources, and scene content. This motion independence further affects restoration performance, often resulting in flicker and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a physics-informed dynamic flare synthesis pipeline, which simulates light source motion using optical flow and models the temporal behaviors of both scattering and reflective flares. Meanwhile, we design a video flare removal network that employs an attention module to spatially suppress flare regions and incorporates a Mamba-based temporal modeling component to capture long range spatio-temporal dependencies. This motion-independent spatiotemporal representation effectively eliminates the need for multi-frame alignment, alleviating temporal aliasing between flares and scene content and thereby improving video flare removal performance. Building upon this, we construct the first video flare dataset to comprehensively evaluate our method, which includes a large set of synthetic paired videos and additional real-world videos collected from the Internet to assess generalization capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing video-based restoration and image-based flare removal methods on both real and synthetic videos, effectively removing dynamic flares while preserving light source integrity and maintaining spatiotemporal consistency of scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u6655\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u5149\u6655\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u56e0\u5149\u6e90\u3001\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u5149\u6655\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u95ea\u70c1\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e13\u95e8\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5149\u6655\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u6a21\u62df\u5149\u6e90\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548cMamba\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53bb\u9664\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u5e27\u5bf9\u9f50\u5373\u53ef\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5408\u6210+\u771f\u5b9e\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u53bb\u5149\u6655\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5149\u6655\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u5149\u6655\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u6655\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u53bb\u5149\u6655\u9886\u57df\u5960\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

An adaptive feature fusion module is introduced to improve multimodal feature interaction and integration.

Recently, DINOv3 has shown remarkable promise in medical image segmentation with its powerful representation capabilities. However, DINOv3, pre-trained on natural images, lacks sensitivity to ultrasound-specific boundary degradation. To address this limitation, we propose FreqDINO, a frequency-guided segmentation framework that enhances boundary perception and structural consistency. Specifically, we devise a Multi-scale Frequency Extraction and Alignment (MFEA) strategy to separate low-frequency structures and multi-scale high-frequency boundary details, and align them via learnable attention. We also introduce a Frequency-Guided Boundary Refinement (FGBR) module that extracts boundary prototypes from high-frequency components and refines spatial features.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for trust prediction, owing to their ability to learn expressive node representations that capture intricate trust relationships within a network. However, current GNN-based trust prediction models face several limitations: (i) Most of them fail to capture trust dynamicity, leading to questionable inferences. (ii) They rarely consider the heterogeneous nature of real-world networks, resulting in a loss of rich semantics. (iii) None of them support context-awareness, a basic property of trust, making prediction results coarse-grained.\n  To this end, we propose CAT, the first Context-Aware GNN-based Trust prediction model that supports trust dynamicity and accurately represents real-world heterogeneity. CAT consists of a graph construction layer, an embedding layer, a heterogeneous attention layer, and a prediction layer. It handles dynamic graphs using continuous-time representations and captures temporal information through a time encoding function. To model graph heterogeneity and leverage semantic information, CAT employs a dual attention mechanism that identifies the importance of different node types and nodes within each type. For context-awareness, we introduce a new notion of meta-paths to extract contextual features. By constructing context embeddings and integrating a context-aware aggregator, CAT can predict both context-aware trust and overall trust.

Truong"], "title": "Surveillance Video-Based Traffic Accident Detection Using Transformer Architecture", "comment": null, "summary": "Road traffic accidents represent a leading cause of mortality globally, with incidence rates rising due to increasing population, urbanization, and motorization. Rising accident rates raise concerns about traffic surveillance effectiveness. Traditional computer vision methods for accident detection struggle with limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Recent advances in transformer architectures excel at modeling global spatial-temporal dependencies and parallel computation. However, applying these models to automated traffic accident detection is limited by small, non-diverse datasets, hindering the development of robust, generalizable systems. To address this gap, we curated a comprehensive and balanced dataset that captures a wide spectrum of traffic environments, accident types, and contextual variations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we propose an accident detection model based on a transformer architecture using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture employs convolutional layers to extract local correlations across diverse patterns within a frame, while leveraging transformers to capture sequential-temporal dependencies among the retrieved features. Moreover, most existing studies neglect the integration of motion cues, which are essential for understanding dynamic scenes, especially during accidents. These approaches typically rely on static features or coarse temporal information.

In this work, we extend the concept of adversarial graphs to the community detection problem, which is more challenging. We propose novel attack and defense techniques for community detection problem, with the objective of hiding targeted individuals from detection models and enhancing the robustness of community detection models, respectively. These techniques have many applications in real-world scenarios, for example, protecting personal privacy in social networks and understanding camouflage patterns in transaction networks. To simulate interactive attack and defense behaviors, we further propose a game-theoretic framework, called CD-GAME. One player is a graph attacker, while the other player is a Rayleigh Quotient defender. The CD-GAME models the mutual influence and feedback mechanisms between the attacker and the defender, revealing the dynamic evolutionary process of the game. Both players dynamically update their strategies until they reach the Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attack and defense methods, and both outperform existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, CD-GAME provides valuable insights for understanding interactive attack and defense scenarios in community detection problems. We found that in traditional single-step attack or defense, attacker tends to employ strategies that are most effective, but are easily detected and countered by defender.

Compared with manual inspection, the intelligent real-time imaging system for underwater pipeline detection has become a more reliable and practical solution. Among various underwater imaging techniques, structured light 3D imaging can restore the sufficient spatial detail for precise defect characterization. Therefore, this paper develops a multi-mode underwater structured light 3D imaging system for pipeline detection (UW-SLD system) based on multi-source information fusion. First, a rapid distortion correction (FDC) method is employed for efficient underwater image rectification. To overcome the challenges of extrinsic calibration among underwater sensors, a factor graph-based parameter optimization method is proposed to estimate the transformation matrix between the structured light and acoustic sensors. Furthermore, a multi-mode 3D imaging strategy is introduced to adapt to the geometric variability of underwater pipelines. Given the presence of numerous disturbances in underwater environments, a multi-source information fusion strategy and an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF) are designed to ensure stable pose estimation and high-accuracy measurements. In particular, an edge detection-based ICP (ED-ICP) algorithm is proposed. This algorithm integrates pipeline edge detection network with enhanced point cloud registration to achieve robust and high-fidelity reconstruction of defect structures even under variable motion conditions. Extensive experiments are conducted under different operation modes, velocities, and depths. The results demonstrate that the developed system achieves superior accuracy, adaptability and robustness, providing a solid foundation for autonomous underwater pipeline detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u6c34\u4e0b\u7ed3\u6784\u51493D\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08UW-SLD\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u9053\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u7ba1\u9053\u6613\u8150\u8680\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u5b9e\u65f6\u6210\u50cf\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u7578\u53d8\u6821\u6b63\uff08FDC\uff09\u3001\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5916\u53c2\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f3D\u6210\u50cf\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08AEKF\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684ICP\uff08ED-ICP\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0UW-SLD\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u4e0b\u7ba1\u9053\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, safety alignment under Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from forgetting learned general abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax. In addition, we theoretically prove that NSPO preserves the model's original core capabilities, while still guaranteeing a descent direction for effective safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks.

Current mainstream methods have made progress in cross-layer feature fusion, but two critical issues persist during the decoding stage. The first is insufficient cross-channel information interaction within the same-layer features, limiting feature expressiveness. The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension. This module performs feature reorganization and interaction across channels to effectively capture complementary cross-channel information. To address the second issue, we construct a collaborative decoding architecture guided by prior knowledge. This architecture generates boundary priors and object localization maps through Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules, then employs hybrid attention to collaboratively calibrate decoded features, effectively overcoming semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries. Additionally, the Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module enriches contextual feature representations. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model. We further transferred our model to the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task and demonstrated its adaptability across downstream tasks, including polyp segmentation, transparent object detection, and industrial and road defect detection.

While Gaussian Blurring Mean Shift (GBMS) has proven effective for identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters in Euclidean space, it struggles with datasets exhibiting hierarchical or tree-like structures. In this work, we introduce HypeGBMS, a novel extension of GBMS to hyperbolic space. Our method replaces Euclidean computations with hyperbolic distances and employs M\u00f6bius-weighted means to ensure that all updates remain consistent with the geometry of the space. HypeGBMS effectively captures latent hierarchies while retaining the density-seeking behavior of GBMS.

To satisfy the exploding editing requirements, the \\underline{complex editing} which contains multiple editing targets has posed as a more challenging task. However, current complex editing solutions: single-round and multi-round editing are limited by long text following and cumulative inconsistency, respectively. Thus, they struggle to strike a balance between semantic alignment and source consistency. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{FlowDC}, which decouples the complex editing into multiple sub-editing effects and superposes them in parallel during the editing process. Meanwhile, we observed that the velocity quantity that is orthogonal to the editing displacement harms the source structure preserving. Thus, we decompose the velocity and decay the orthogonal part for better source consistency.

In real-world settings, some anomalous events have lasting effects and influence the forecast, while others are short-lived and should be ignored.

We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts. Experiments on the Traffic and Electricity benchmarks, as well as on a real-world cash-demand dataset, demonstrate that Co-TSFA improves performance under anomalous conditions while maintaining accuracy on normal data.

To avoid the significant memory consumption and limited generalizability brought by building separate models per class, we focus on developing a unified framework for multi-class anomaly detection. However, under this challenging setting, conventional reconstruction-based networks often suffer from an identity mapping problem, where they directly replicate input features regardless of whether they are normal or anomalous, resulting in detection failures. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel framework termed Collaborative Reconstruction and Repair (CRR), which transforms the reconstruction to repairation. First, we optimize the decoder to reconstruct normal samples while repairing synthesized anomalies. Consequently, it generates distinct representations for anomalous regions and similar representations for normal areas compared to the encoder's output. Second, we implement feature-level random masking to ensure that the representations from decoder contain sufficient local information. Finally, to minimize detection errors arising from the discrepancies between feature representations from the encoder and decoder, we train a segmentation network supervised by synthetic anomaly masks, thereby enhancing localization performance.

In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache.

However, raw sensor streams are often imbalanced and contain significant redundancy, meaning that not all data points contribute equally to model generalization. In this paper, we show that, in some cases, \"less is more\" when considering datasets. We do this by reframing the data selection problem: rather than tuning model hyperparameters, we fix the model and optimize the composition of the training data itself. We introduce a framework for discovering the optimal \"training diet\" from a large, unlabeled time series corpus. Our framework first uses a large-scale encoder and k-means clustering to partition the dataset into distinct, behaviorally consistent clusters. These clusters represent the fundamental 'ingredients' available for training. We then employ the Optuna optimization framework to search the high-dimensional space of possible data mixtures.

MKL seeks an optimal linear combination of base kernels that maximizes a generalized performance measure under a regularization constraint. Various norms have been used to regularize the kernel weights, including $l1$, $l2$ and $lp$, as well as the \"elastic-net\" penalty, which combines $l1$- and $l2$-norm to promote both sparsity and the selection of correlated kernels. This property makes elastic-net regularized MKL (ENMKL) especially valuable when model interpretability is critical and kernels capture correlated information, such as in neuroimaging. Previous ENMKL methods have followed a two-stage procedure: fix kernel weights, train a support vector machine (SVM) with the weighted kernel, and then update the weights via gradient descent, cutting-plane methods, or surrogate functions. Here, we introduce an alternative ENMKL formulation that yields a simple analytical update for the kernel weights. We derive explicit algorithms for both SVM and kernel ridge regression (KRR) under this framework, and implement them in the open-source Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). We evaluate these ENMKL algorithms against $l1$-norm MKL and against SVM (or KRR) trained on the unweighted sum of kernels across three neuroimaging applications. Our results show that ENMKL matches or outperforms $l1$-norm MKL in all tasks and only underperforms standard SVM in one scenario.

However, SSL for 3D point clouds still faces critical challenges due to irregular geometry, shortcut-prone reconstruction, and unbalanced semantics distribution. In this work, we propose DOS (Distilling Observable Softmaps), a novel SSL framework that self-distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable (unmasked) points. This strategy prevents information leakage from masked regions and provides richer supervision than discrete token-to-prototype assignments. To address the challenge of unbalanced semantics in an unsupervised setting, we introduce Zipfian prototypes and incorporate them using a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, Zipf-Sinkhorn, which enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates the sharpness of the target softmap during training. DOS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, and ScanNet200, without relying on extra data or annotations.

We introduce Brain-Semantoks, a self-supervised framework designed specifically to learn abstract representations of brain dynamics. Its architecture is built on two core innovations: a semantic tokenizer that aggregates noisy regional signals into robust tokens representing functional networks, and a self-distillation objective that enforces representational stability across time. We show that this objective is stabilized through a novel training curriculum, ensuring the model robustly learns meaningful features from low signal-to-noise time series.

During iterative design, adjustments to the geometric shape inevitably require synchronized edits to the underlying parametric sequence, called geometry-driven parametric CAD editing. The task calls for 1) preserving the original sequence's structure, 2) ensuring each edit's semantic validity, and 3) maintaining high shape fidelity to the target shape, all under scarce editing data triplets. We present CADMorph, an iterative plan-generate-verify framework that orchestrates pretrained domain-specific foundation models during inference: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. In the planning stage, cross-attention maps from the P2S model pinpoint the segments that need modification and offer editing masks. The MPP model then infills these masks with semantically valid edits in the generation stage. During verification, the P2S model embeds each candidate sequence in shape-latent space, measures its distance to the target shape, and selects the closest one. The three stages leverage the inherent geometric consciousness and design knowledge in pretrained priors, and thus tackle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively. Besides, both P2S and MPP models are trained without triplet data, bypassing the data-scarcity bottleneck.

We analyze nonlinear models with the logistic loss and show that the steps of GD reduce to those of generalized perceptron algorithms (Rosenblatt, 1958), providing a new perspective on the dynamics. This reduction yields significantly simpler algorithmic steps, which we analyze using classical linear algebra tools.

Inspired by the recent success of the selective state-space model (SSM) Mamba in modeling 1D temporal sequences, we propose TSkel-Mamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba framework that effectively captures both spatial and temporal dynamics. In particular, our approach leverages Spatial Transformer for spatial feature learning while utilizing Mamba for temporal modeling. Mamba, however, employs separate SSM blocks for individual channels, which inherently limits its ability to model inter-channel dependencies. To better adapt Mamba for skeleton data and enhance Mamba`s ability to model temporal dependencies, we introduce a Temporal Dynamic Modeling (TDM) block, which is a versatile plug-and-play component that integrates a novel Multi-scale Temporal Interaction (MTI) module. The MTI module employs multi-scale Cycle operators to capture cross-channel temporal interactions, a critical factor in action recognition.

In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised assisted automatic abutment design framework (SS$A^3$D), which employs a dual-branch architecture with a reconstruction branch and a regression branch. The reconstruction branch learns to restore masked intraoral scan data and transfers the learned structural information to the regression branch. The regression branch then predicts the abutment parameters under supervised learning, which eliminates the separate pre-training and fine-tuning process. We also design a Text-Conditioned Prompt (TCP) module to incorporate clinical information (such as implant location, system, and series) into SS$A^3$D. This guides the network to focus on relevant regions and constrains the parameter predictions.

However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u683c\u6a21\u578b\uff08LTMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SCL\uff09\u7684\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u548c\u6d41\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SL\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u5404\u81ea\u72ec\u7acb\uff0cCL\u5ffd\u89c6\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0cSL\u5ffd\u7565\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7528LTMs\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5728\u7ebf\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u8349\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff08\u5e73\u8861\u65b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u538b\u7f29\uff08\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u5b58\u3001\u907f\u514d\u5197\u4f59\uff09\u4e24\u5927\u539f\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SCL\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86CL\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0eSL\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "LTMs\u4e3aSCL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u534f\u8c03\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Trained in a supervised, single-step fashion on large datasets, VGGT raises a key question: does it build upon geometric concepts like traditional multi-view methods, or does it rely primarily on learned appearance-based data-driven priors? In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of VGGT's internal mechanisms to uncover whether geometric understanding emerges within its representations. By probing intermediate features, analyzing attention patterns, and performing interventions, we examine how the model implements its functionality. Our findings reveal that VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching within its global attention layers and encodes epipolar geometry, despite being trained without explicit geometric constraints.

Bayesian optimization, a widely used black-box and sample-efficient learning method, constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the closed-loop performance from few experiments and uses it to select informative controller parameters. However, it typically struggles with dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations, as they may appear, for example, in tuning model predictive controllers, because standard surrogate models fail to capture the structure of such spaces. This work suggests that the use of Bayesian neural networks as surrogate models may help to mitigate this limitation. Through a comparison between Gaussian processes with Matern kernels, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks on a cart-pole task, we find that Bayesian neural network surrogate models achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost and enable successful optimization of parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions. Infinite-width Bayesian neural networks also maintain performance in settings with more than one thousand parameters, whereas Matern-kernel Gaussian processes rapidly lose effectiveness.

While robust aggregation methods (including Krum, Bulyan, and coordinate-wise defenses) offer theoretical guarantees under idealized assumptions, their effectiveness erodes substantially when client data distributions are heterogeneous (non-IID) and adversaries can observe or approximate the defense mechanism.\n  This paper introduces SpectralKrum, a defense that fuses spectral subspace estimation with geometric neighbor-based selection. The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. The method requires no auxiliary data, operates entirely on model updates, and preserves FL privacy properties.\n  We evaluate SpectralKrum against eight robust baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet-distributed non-IID partitions (alpha = 0.1).

Deep learning is particularly effective for this task, as it integrates spectral, temporal, and spatial signals that jointly reflect the canopy structure. To address this need, we introduce THREASURE-Net, a novel end-to-end framework for Tree Height Regression And Super-Resolution. The model is trained on Sentinel-2 time series using reference height metrics derived from LiDAR HD data at multiple spatial resolutions over Metropolitan France to produce annual height maps. We evaluate three model variants, producing tree-height predictions at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution. THREASURE-Net does not rely on any pretrained model nor on reference very high resolution optical imagery to train its super-resolution module; instead, it learns solely from LiDAR-derived height information. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods based on Sentinel data and is competitive with methods based on very high resolution imagery.

We propose the Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC), a hybrid architecture that bridges deep learning and classical approximation theory. AVC decouples manifold learning from function approximation by using a deep network to learn a diffeomorphic warping of the physical domain, projecting complex spatiotemporal dynamics onto a latent manifold where the solution is represented by a basis of generalized analytic functions. Crucially, we replace the standard gradient-descent output layer with a differentiable linear solver, allowing the network to optimally resolve spectral coefficients in a closed form during the forward pass. We evaluate AVC on a suite of five rigorous physics benchmarks, including high-frequency Helmholtz wave propagation, sparse medical reconstruction, and unsteady 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence. Our results demonstrate that AVC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing parameter counts by orders of magnitude (e.g., 840 parameters vs. 4.2 million for 3D grids) and converging 2-3x faster than implicit neural representations.

Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels.

Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart.

We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \\approx X_2$). The relative scaling of the L--shaped arms reveals feature dominance in which element consistently provides more information. Although computed only from pairwise measurements, higher--order interactions among three or more elements emerge naturally through consistent cross--pair relationships (e.g. AB, AC, BC).

In this paper, we propose 3DTeethSAM, an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for 3D teeth segmentation. SAM2 is a pretrained foundation model for image and video segmentation, demonstrating a strong backbone in various downstream scenarios. To adapt SAM2 for 3D teeth data, we render images of 3D teeth models from predefined views, apply SAM2 for 2D segmentation, and reconstruct 3D results using 2D-3D projections. Since SAM2's performance depends on input prompts and its initial outputs often have deficiencies, and given its class-agnostic nature, we introduce three light-weight learnable modules: (1) a prompt embedding generator to derive prompt embeddings from image embeddings for accurate mask decoding, (2) a mask refiner to enhance SAM2's initial segmentation results, and (3) a mask classifier to categorize the generated masks. Additionally, we incorporate Deformable Global Attention Plugins (DGAP) into SAM2's image encoder. The DGAP enhances both the segmentation accuracy and the speed of the training process.

Given a set of images from objects in specific angles (keys), we benchmark the performance of segmenting novel views (queries) and report the scores in 4 categories of easy, medium, hard, and extreme based on the key-query view contrast. We benchmark 8 state-of-the-art foundation models and show DINO-based encoders remain competitive across large viewpoint shifts, while 3D-aware models like VGGT require dedicated multi-view adjustments.

Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency.

In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \\textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\\mathbf\u03a3_{obs} = \\mathbf\u03a3_{HR} + \\mathbf\u03a3_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation.

We utilize a pre-trained image encoder to extract facial expression latents from the driving video as control signals for animation generation. Such latents implicitly capture nuanced facial expression dynamics with identity and pose information disentangled, and they are efficiently injected into the video diffusion transformer through our proposed expression controller.

Although Text-to-Motion (T2M) generative models offer a compelling, scalable source of synthetic data, their training objectives, which emphasize general artistic motion, and dataset structures fundamentally differ from HAR's requirements for kinematically precise, class-discriminative actions. This disparity creates a significant domain gap, making generalist T2M models ill-equipped for generating motions suitable for HAR classifiers. To address this challenge, we propose KineMIC (Kinetic Mining In Context), a transfer learning framework for few-shot action synthesis. KineMIC adapts a T2M diffusion model to an HAR domain by hypothesizing that semantic correspondences in the text encoding space can provide soft supervision for kinematic distillation. We operationalize this via a kinetic mining strategy that leverages CLIP text embeddings to establish correspondences between sparse HAR labels and T2M source data. This process guides fine-tuning, transforming the generalist T2M backbone into a specialized few-shot Action-to-Motion generator. We validate KineMIC using HumanML3D as the source T2M dataset and a subset of NTU RGB+D 120 as the target HAR domain, randomly selecting just 10 samples per action class. Our approach generates significantly more coherent motions, providing a robust data augmentation source that delivers a +23.1% accuracy points improvement.

To address these challenges, we propose Cross-modal Context-aware Learning for Visual Prompt-Guided Multimodal Image Understanding (CLV-Net).

Central to our design is a Context-Aware Mask Decoder that models and integrates inter-object relationships to strengthen target representations and improve mask quality. In addition, we introduce a Semantic and Relationship Alignment module: a Cross-modal Semantic Consistency Loss enhances fine-grained discrimination among visually similar targets, while a Relationship Consistency Loss enforces alignment between textual relations and visual interactions. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that CLV-Net outperforms existing methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results.

Traditional copy paste augmentation often produces unrealistic composites due to inaccurate foreground extraction, inconsistent scene geometry, and mismatched background semantics. To address these limitations, we propose Depth Copy Paste, a multimodal and depth aware augmentation framework that generates diverse and physically consistent face detection training samples by copying full body person instances and pasting them into semantically compatible scenes. Our approach first employs BLIP and CLIP to jointly assess semantic and visual coherence, enabling automatic retrieval of the most suitable background images for the given foreground person. To ensure high quality foreground masks that preserve facial details, we integrate SAM3 for precise segmentation and Depth-Anything to extract only the non occluded visible person regions, preventing corrupted facial textures from being used in augmentation.

However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks demonstrate that, with fewer than 1B parameters, our model achieves similarity performance while enabling 6 times faster editing. Moreover, it delivers comparable or superior editing quality, with improvements of 3.6% and 17.6% on style change and style transfer tasks, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u751f\u6210\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08MGT\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6EditMGT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u7801\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6291\u5236\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u6539\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08DMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u56e0\u5168\u5c40\u53bb\u566a\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u88ab\u610f\u5916\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u51c6\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEditMGT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528MGT\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u9ad8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u533a\u57df\u4fee\u6539\u50cf\u7d20\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6CrispEdit-2M\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6ce8\u5165\u590d\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3MGT\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0eSOTA\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53476\u500d\uff0c\u98ce\u683c\u6539\u53d8\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.6%\u548c17.6%\uff1b\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e8e10\u4ebf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "MGT\u56e0\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u7801\u7279\u6027\u5929\u7136\u9002\u914d\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0cEditMGT\u65e0\u9700\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Traditional change detection methods typically identify all changes between two temporal images without distinguishing the types of transitions, which can lead to results that may not align with specific user needs. Although semantic change detection methods have attempted to address this by categorizing changes into predefined classes, these methods rely on rigid class definitions and fixed model architectures, making it difficult to mix datasets with different label sets or reuse models across tasks, as the output channels are tightly coupled with the number and type of semantic classes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Referring Change Detection (RCD), which leverages natural language prompts to detect specific classes of changes in remote sensing images. By integrating language understanding with visual analysis, our approach allows users to specify the exact type of change they are interested in. However, training models for RCD is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data and severe class imbalance in existing datasets. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework consisting of (I) \\textbf{RCDNet}, a cross-modal fusion network designed for referring change detection, and (II) \\textbf{RCDGen}, a diffusion-based synthetic data generation pipeline that produces realistic post-change images and change maps for a specified category using only pre-change image, without relying on semantic segmentation masks and thereby significantly lowering the barrier to scalable data creation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our framework enables scalable and targeted change detection.

We address this by reframing music-to-dance generation as a music-token-conditioned multi-channel image synthesis problem: 2D pose sequences are encoded as one-hot images, compressed by a pretrained image VAE, and modeled with a DiT-style backbone, allowing us to inherit architectural and training advances from modern text-to-image models and better capture high-variance 2D pose distributions. On top of this formulation, we introduce (i) a time-shared temporal indexing scheme that explicitly synchronizes music tokens and pose latents over time and (ii) a reference-pose conditioning strategy that preserves subject-specific body proportions and on-screen scale while enabling long-horizon segment-and-stitch generation. Experiments on a large in-the-wild 2D dance corpus and the calibrated AIST++2D benchmark show consistent improvements over representative music-to-dance methods in pose- and video-space metrics and human preference, and ablations validate the contributions of the representation, temporal indexing, and reference conditioning.

However, traditional domain adaptation methods often struggle to bridge the domain gap when synthetic images lack the complex textures and visual patterns of real samples. In this work, we adapt the Inversion-Based Style Transfer (InST) framework originally designed for artistic style transfer to biomedical microscopy images. Our method combines latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer the style from real fluorescence microscopy images to synthetic ones, while weakly preserving content structure.\n  We evaluate the effectiveness of our InST-based synthetic dataset for downstream cell counting by pre-training and fine-tuning EfficientNet-B0 models on various data sources, including real data, hard-coded synthetic data, and the public Cell200-s dataset. Models trained with our InST-synthesized images achieve up to 37\\% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to models trained on hard-coded synthetic data, and a 52\\% reduction in MAE compared to models trained on Cell200-s (from 53.70 to 25.95 MAE). Notably, our approach also outperforms models trained on real data alone (25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE). Further improvements are achieved when combining InST-synthesized data with lightweight domain adaptation techniques such as DACS with CutMix. These findings demonstrate that InST-based style transfer most effectively reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real microscopy data.

The final version will be available on IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Model fingerprint detection techniques have emerged as a promising approach for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, but their robustness under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models.

While leveraging segmentation data can enhance semantic stability, the lack of effective boundary supervision often leads to segmentation-like mattes lacking fine details. To this end, we introduce a learned Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE) that assesses semantic and boundary quality of alpha mattes without ground truth. It produces a pixel-wise evaluation map that identifies reliable and erroneous regions, enabling fine-grained quality assessment. The MQE scales up video matting in two ways: (1) as an online matting-quality feedback during training to suppress erroneous regions, providing comprehensive supervision, and (2) as an offline selection module for data curation, improving annotation quality by combining the strengths of leading video and image matting models. This process allows us to build a large-scale real-world video matting dataset, VMReal, containing 28K clips and 2.4M frames. To handle large appearance variations in long videos, we introduce a reference-frame training strategy that incorporates long-range frames beyond the local window for effective training.

For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\\% on VBench, 21-22\\% lower FVD, and 71.4\\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\\%) by 2.60\\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\\% and 22.46\\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences.

However, a closed-loop framework that jointly understands intrinsic scene properties (e.g., albedo, normal, material, and irradiance), leverages them for video synthesis, and supports editable intrinsic representations remains unexplored. We present V-RGBX, the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing. V-RGBX unifies three key capabilities: (1) video inverse rendering into intrinsic channels, (2) photorealistic video synthesis from these intrinsic representations, and (3) keyframe-based video editing conditioned on intrinsic channels. At the core of V-RGBX is an interleaved conditioning mechanism that enables intuitive, physically grounded video editing through user-selected keyframes, supporting flexible manipulation of any intrinsic modality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that V-RGBX produces temporally consistent, photorealistic videos while propagating keyframe edits across sequences in a physically plausible manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse applications, including object appearance editing and scene-level relighting, surpassing the performance of prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "V-RGBX\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u5185\u8574\u611f\u77e5\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u5185\u8574\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u3001\u6cd5\u7ebf\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u3001\u8f90\u7167\u5ea6\uff09\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "V-RGBX\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u3001\u5185\u8574\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u7684\u5185\u8574\u6761\u4ef6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "V-RGBX\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u5149\u5ea6\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u7f16\u8f91\u7269\u4f53\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "V-RGBX\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u8574\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u900f\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\u6539\u8fdb3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u534a\u900f\u660e\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6216\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093DGS\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u7684alpha\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u79ef\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6e32\u67d3\u590d\u6742\u91cd\u53e0\u534a\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u7684\u65e0\u5e8f\u900f\u660e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u50cf\u7d20\u77e9\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u900f\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u91c7\u6837\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6216\u50cf\u7d20\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u534a\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7269\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5149\u6805\u5316\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u900f\u5c04\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63a8\u52a83DGS\u5728\u590d\u6742\u900f\u660e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
