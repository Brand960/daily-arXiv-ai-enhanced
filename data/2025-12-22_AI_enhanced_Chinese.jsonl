By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality.

The two models were then explored comprehensively and holistically to determine which model was most effective in detecting pornographic content quickly.

We introduce the Adaptive Visual Model (AVM), a structure-preserving framework that enables condition-aware adaptation through modular subnetworks, without modifying the core representation. AVM keeps a Vision Transformer-based encoder frozen to capture consistent visual features, while independently trained modulation paths account for neural response variations driven by stimulus content and subject identity. We evaluate AVM in three experimental settings, including stimulus-level variation, cross-subject generalization, and cross-dataset adaptation, all of which involve structured changes in inputs and individuals. Across two large-scale mouse V1 datasets, AVM outperforms the state-of-the-art V1T model by approximately 2% in predictive correlation, demonstrating robust generalization, interpretable condition-wise modulation, and high architectural efficiency. Specifically, AVM achieves a 9.1% improvement in explained variance (FEVE) under the cross-dataset adaptation setting. These results suggest that AVM provides a unified framework for adaptive neural modeling across biological and experimental conditions, offering a scalable solution under structural constraints.

New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar.

The framework is built on a hybrid Bayesian inference scheme that represents the joint multi-source probability density and incorporates physics-informed state transitions, including source birth, removal, and merging induced by atmospheric dispersion. A superposition-based measurement model is naturally accommodated, allowing sparse concentration measurements to be exploited efficiently. To guide robot deployment, we introduce a wind-aware coverage control (WCC) strategy that integrates the evolving multi-source belief with local wind information to prioritize regions of high detection likelihood. Unlike conventional coverage control or information-theoretic planners, WCC explicitly accounts for anisotropic plume transport when modelling sensor performance, leading to more effective sensor placement for multi-source estimation. Monte Carlo studies demonstrate faster convergence and improved separation of individual source beliefs compared to traditional coverage-based strategies and small-scale static sensor networks. Real-world experiments with CO2 releases using TurtleBot platforms further validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its practicality for scalable multi-robot gas-sensing applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u591a\u6e90\u6c14\u4f53\u91ca\u653e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u98ce\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6e90\u6c14\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u6c14\u4f53\u91ca\u653e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u6e90\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u98ce\u573a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u6e90\u5206\u79bb\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u6e90\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\uff08\u6e90\u751f\u6210\u3001\u79fb\u9664\u3001\u5408\u5e76\uff09\u4e0e\u53e0\u52a0\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u98ce\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\u63a7\u5236\uff08WCC\uff09\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u6e90\u5206\u79bb\u66f4\u4f18\uff1b\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08TurtleBot+CO2\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MRMSTE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u98ce\u573a\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6c14\u4f53\u6e90\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8986\u76d6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\u3002"}}

This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation.

This project presents a low-cost, dual-mode neuro-muscular control system integrating electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to enable real-time, multi-degree-of-freedom control of a prosthetic arm. EEG signals are acquired using the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2 and transmitted via ThinkGear Bluetooth packets to an ESP32 microcontroller running a lightweight classification model. The model was trained on 1500 seconds of recorded EEG data using a 6-frame sliding window with low-pass filtering, excluding poor-signal samples and using a 70/20/10 training--validation--test split. The classifier detects strong blink events, which toggle the hand between open and closed states. EMG signals are acquired using a MyoWare 2.0 sensor and SparkFun wireless shield and transmitted to a second ESP32, which performs threshold-based detection. Three activation bands (rest: 0--T1; extension: T1--T2; contraction: greater than T2) enable intuitive elbow control, with movement triggered only after eight consecutive frames in a movement class to improve stability. The EEG-controlled ESP32 actuates four finger servos, while the EMG-controlled ESP32 drives two elbow servos. A functional prototype was constructed using low-cost materials (total cost approximately 240 dollars), with most expense attributed to the commercial EEG headset. Future work includes transitioning to a 3D-printed chassis, integrating auto-regressive models to reduce EMG latency, and upgrading servo torque for improved load capacity and grip strength.

Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "InfoTok\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u8bcd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c1120%\u7684token\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b02.3\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u538b\u7f29\u7387\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eShannon\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u7684ELBO\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efaTransformer\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff0c\u6309\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914dtoken\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u8282\u770120% token\uff0c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u63d0\u53472.3\u500d\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "InfoTok\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Companion robots offer a potential solution. However, current companion robots often lack advanced functionality, while task-oriented robots are not designed for social interaction, limiting their suitability and acceptance by seniors. Our work introduces a senior-oriented system for quadruped robots that allows for more intuitive user input and provides more socially expressive output. For user input, we implemented a MediaPipe-based module for hand gesture and head movement recognition, enabling control without a remote. For output, we designed and trained robotic dog gestures using curriculum-based reinforcement learning in Isaac Gym, progressing from simple standing to three-legged balancing and leg extensions, and more. The final tests achieved over 95\\% success on average in simulation, and we validated a key social gesture (the paw-lift) on a Unitree robot. Real-world tests demonstrated the feasibility and social expressiveness of this framework, while also revealing sim-to-real challenges in joint compliance, load distribution, and balance control. These contributions advance the development of practical quadruped robots as social companions for the senior and outline pathways for sim-to-real adaptation and inform future user studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u7684\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u624b\u52bf\u4e0e\u5934\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u793e\u4ea4\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u966a\u4f34\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8001\u9f84\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u4e2d\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u5b64\u72ec\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u5cfb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u966a\u4f34\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u529f\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7f3a\u4e4f\u793e\u4ea4\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528MediaPipe\u5b9e\u73b0\u624b\u52bf\u4e0e\u5934\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728Isaac Gym\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72d7\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u62ac\u722a\u3001\u4e09\u817f\u5e73\u8861\u7b49\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d8595%\uff0c\u5728Unitree\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u62ac\u722a\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u793e\u4ea4\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bc1\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5177\u793e\u4ea4\u8868\u73b0\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5173\u8282\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u3001\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u63a7\u5236\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u793e\u4ea4\u4f34\u4fa3\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u9002\u914d\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Among the prominent approaches, the Kernel Trick, widely used in support vector machines, provides efficient similarity computation, while the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM), originating from quantum state discrimination, enables classification grounded in Hilbert space geometry. Building on recent developments in kernelized PGM (KPGM) and direct PGM-based classifiers, this work presents a unified theoretical and empirical comparison of these paradigms. We analyze their performance across synthetic oversampling scenarios using Quantum SMOTE (QSMOTE) variants. Experimental results show that both PGM and KPGM classifiers consistently outperform a classical random forest baseline, particularly when multiple quantum copies are employed. Notably, PGM with stereo encoding and n_copies=2 achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234), while KPGM demonstrates competitive and more stable behavior across QSMOTE variants, with top scores of 0.8511 (stereo) and 0.8483 (amplitude). These findings highlight that quantum-inspired classifiers not only provide tangible gains in recall and balanced performance but also offer complementary strengths: PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements, whereas KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies.

Accepted at ACRA 2025 (Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation)", "summary": "Interactive reinforcement learning (IRL) has shown promise in enabling autonomous agents and robots to learn complex behaviours from human teachers, yet the dynamics of teacher selection remain poorly understood. This paper reveals an unexpected phenomenon in IRL: when given a choice between teachers with different reward structures, learning agents overwhelmingly prefer conservative, low-reward teachers (93.16% selection rate) over those offering 20x higher rewards. Through 1,250 experimental runs in navigation tasks with multiple expert teachers, we discovered: (1) Conservative bias dominates teacher selection: agents systematically choose the lowest-reward teacher, prioritising consistency over optimality; (2) Critical performance thresholds exist at teacher availability rho >= 0.6 and accuracy omega >= 0.6, below which the framework fails catastrophically; (3) The framework achieves 159% improvement over baseline Q-learning under concept drift. These findings challenge fundamental assumptions about optimal teaching in RL and suggest potential implications for human-robot collaboration, where human preferences for safety and consistency may align with the observed agent selection behaviour, potentially informing training paradigms for safety-critical robotic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u504f\u7231\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6559\u5e08\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6559\u5e08\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u4f18\u6559\u5b66\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u504f\u597d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc71250\u6b21\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u6027\u80fd\u9608\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f5393.16%\u9009\u62e9\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u6559\u5e08\uff1b\u5b58\u5728rho>=0.6\u548comega>=0.6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebfQ\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347159%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b89\u5168\u503e\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u4fdd\u5b88\u6559\u5e08\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

While Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures mitigate some of these conflicts, their routing mechanisms typically rely on explicitly trained auxiliary classifiers. This not only increases system complexity but also often lacks interpretability when handling mixed-domain inputs.\n  Building upon the premise that ``Compression is Intelligence,'' this paper proposes a novel architectural philosophy: \\textbf{``Compression is Routing.''} We trained an 87M-parameter end-to-end Transformer Autoencoder, achieving a \\textbf{64x sequence length compression} (compressing 512 tokens into 8 latent vectors). Experimental results demonstrate that this compressor possesses extreme domain discriminative capability: it achieves a reconstruction accuracy of \\textbf{99.47\\%} on the in-domain (code) validation set; accuracy drops sharply to \\textbf{47.76\\%} on a semi-out-of-distribution domain (Wiki text); and further plummets to just \\textbf{0.57\\%} on a fully out-of-distribution domain (random sequences).\n  This extreme and systematic performance discrepancy establishes the validity of reconstruction error as an \\textbf{Intrinsic Distribution Fingerprint}. Based on this, we propose that expert modules can be automatically scheduled using reconstruction residuals directly, without the need for explicit gating networks. This mechanism offers excellent scalability. Furthermore, this architecture provides a new perspective on ``VRAM compression'' for handling ultra-long contexts. This report aims to verify the physical validity of this foundational architecture, offering a new research perspective for the next generation of scalable modular neural networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u300e\u538b\u7f29\u5373\u8def\u7531\u300f\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u752887M\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b064\u500d\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u9762\u4e34\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0cMoE\u67b6\u6784\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u8bad\u7ec387M\u53c2\u6570Transformer\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e8f\u5217\u538b\u7f29\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u6307\u7eb9\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u57df\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe99.47%\uff0c\u7ef4\u57fa\u6587\u672c\u964d\u81f347.76%\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u5e8f\u5217\u4ec50.57%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u9886\u57df\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u95e8\u63a7\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0eVRAM\u538b\u7f29\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This is coupled with a high-fidelity imitation learning control policy, the MotionTracker, which enables the Unitree G1 humanoid robot to execute these complex motions dynamically and maintain balance. To ensure feasibility, we employ a robust General Motion Retargeting (GMR) method to bridge the embodiment gap between human motion data and the robot platform.

This study presents a lightweight gradient boosting framework (XGBoost) trained exclusively on surface observation data (METAR) and enhanced through physics-guided feature engineering based on thermodynamic principles. The framework is evaluated across 11 international airports representing distinct climatic regimes (including SCEL, KJFK, KORD, KDEN, SBGR, and VIDP) using historical data from 2000 to 2024. Results suggest that the model successfully captures underlying local physical processes without manual configuration. In a blind comparative evaluation against operational TAF forecasts, the automated model achieved substantially higher detection rates at tactical horizons (3 hours), with a 2.5 to 4.0 times improvement in recall while reducing false alarms.

Yet, existing satellite-based disturbance products remain too coarse to detect changes at the scale of individual trees, typically below 100 m$^{2}$. Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$\u0394$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging.

However, when faced with complex and curved pipeline scenarios, these methods often fail due to problems such as cable entanglement and insufficient equipment flexibility. To address this pain point, we designed a self-propelled pipeline robot. This robot can autonomously complete the location work of complex and curved pipelines in complex pipe networks without external dragging. In terms of pipeline mapping technology, traditional visual mapping and laser mapping methods are easily affected by lighting conditions and insufficient features in the confined space of pipelines, resulting in mapping drift and divergence problems. In contrast, the pipeline location method that integrates inertial navigation and wheel odometers is less affected by pipeline environmental factors. Based on this, this paper proposes a pipeline robot location method based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF). Firstly, the body attitude angle is initially obtained through an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Then, the extended Kalman filtering algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of attitude angle estimation. Finally, high-precision pipeline location is achieved by combining wheel odometers. During the testing phase, the roll wheels of the pipeline robot needed to fit tightly against the pipe wall to reduce slippage. However, excessive tightness would reduce the flexibility of motion control due to excessive friction. Therefore, a balance needed to be struck between the robot's motion capability and positioning accuracy. Experiments were conducted using the self-propelled pipeline robot in a rectangular loop pipeline, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed dead reckoning algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7684\u81ea\u63a8\u8fdb\u7ba1\u9053\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u878d\u5408IMU\u4e0e\u8f6e\u5f0f\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f2f\u66f2\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4eea\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5f2f\u66f2\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u7535\u7f06\u7f20\u7ed5\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6fc0\u5149\u5efa\u56fe\u6613\u53d7\u5149\u7167\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528IMU\u521d\u6b65\u83b7\u53d6\u59ff\u6001\u89d2\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08EKF\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u518d\u878d\u5408\u8f6e\u5f0f\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u822a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7b97\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6eda\u8f6e\u4e0e\u7ba1\u58c1\u538b\u529b\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77e9\u5f62\u73af\u5f62\u7ba1\u9053\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7ba1\u9053\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ba1\u9053\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

In Part 2, we evaluated the effectiveness of speech, visual display, micromotion and their multimodal combination in conveying specific intentions (correct cup selection) during a two-cup delivery task. The results indicate that, while speech is highly effective in capturing attention, it is less successful in clearly communicating intention.

In this work, we study distribution restoration with abundant noisy samples, assuming the corruption process is available as a black-box generator. We show that this task can be framed as a one-sided entropic optimal transport problem and solved via an EM-like algorithm. We further provide a test criterion to determine whether the true underlying distribution is recoverable under per-sample information loss, and show that in otherwise unrecoverable cases, a small number of clean samples can render the distribution largely recoverable.

Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: \"How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?\". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance. The generality of IUS for synthetic data assessment is demonstrated also for greyscale X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities.

In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences.

A modular neuro-symbolic control framework that clearly distinguishes between low-level motion execution and high-level semantic reasoning is proposed in this work. While a lightweight neural delta controller performs bounded, incremental actions in continuous space, a locally deployed LLM interprets symbolic tasks. We assess the suggested method in a planar manipulation setting with spatial relations between objects specified by language. Numerous tasks and local language models, such as Mistral, Phi, and LLaMA-3.2, are used in extensive experiments to compare LLM-only control, neural-only control, and the suggested LLM+DL framework. In comparison to LLM-only baselines, the results show that the neuro-symbolic integration consistently increases both success rate and efficiency, achieving average step reductions exceeding 70% and speedups of up to 8.83x while remaining robust to language model quality. The suggested framework enhances interpretability, stability, and generalization without any need of reinforcement learning or costly rollouts by controlling the LLM to symbolic outputs and allocating uninterpreted execution to a neural controller trained on artificial geometric data. These outputs show empirically that neuro-symbolic decomposition offers a scalable and principled way to integrate language understanding with ongoing control, this approach promotes the creation of dependable and effective language-guided embodied systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4e0e\u672c\u5730LLM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u52a8\u4f5c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff1aLLM\u8d1f\u8d23\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8d1f\u8d23\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u51e0\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eafLLM\u6216\u7eaf\u795e\u7ecf\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6b65\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u8d8570%\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe8.83\u500d\uff0c\u5bf9LLM\u8d28\u91cf\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u53ef\u9760\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u5177\u8eab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

This misalignment often triggers driver-initiated takeovers and system disengagements during closed-loop execution. How to leverage those expert takeover data from disengagement scenarios and effectively expand the IL policy's capability presents a valuable yet unexplored challenge. In this paper, we propose TakeAD, a novel preference-based post-optimization framework that fine-tunes the pre-trained IL policy with this disengagement data to enhance the closed-loop driving performance. First, we design an efficient expert takeover data collection pipeline inspired by human takeover mechanisms in real-world autonomous driving systems. Then, this post optimization framework integrates iterative Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) for imitation learning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for preference alignment. The DAgger stage equips the policy with fundamental capabilities to handle disengagement states through direct imitation of expert interventions. Subsequently, the DPO stage refines the policy's behavior to better align with expert preferences in disengagement scenarios. Through multiple iterations, the policy progressively learns recovery strategies for disengagement states, thereby mitigating the open-loop gap.

We investigate whether training on intentionally flawed reasoning traces can teach models to detect and recover from such errors without degrading standard problem-solving ability. Using competition-level problems from MATH-lighteval, we generate CoT prefixes containing exactly one controlled error, either a calculation error (sign flips, dropped terms) or a reasoning error (misapplied rules, unjustified logical steps), and fine-tune Qwen3-4B with GRPO using a binary final-answer reward. Our Mixed-CoT-RL model matches standard RL on clean problems (41% vs 41%) while substantially outperforming it on problems prefilled with flawed reasoning (24% vs 19%). Notably, clean-only RL fine-tuning degrades robustness below the untuned baseline 19% vs. 20%), indicating that conventional training increases susceptibility to misleading prefills.

This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning.

Insights from a Pilot Study", "comment": null, "summary": "Robot-aided gait rehabilitation facilitates high-intensity and repeatable therapy. However, most exoskeletons rely on pre-recorded, non-personalized gait trajectories constrained to the sagittal plane, potentially limiting movement naturalness and user comfort. We present a data-driven gait personalization framework for an exoskeleton that supports multi-planar motion, including hip abduction/adduction and pelvic translation and rotation. Personalized trajectories to individual participants were generated using regression models trained on anthropometric, demographic, and walking speed data from a normative database. In a within-subject experiment involving ten unimpaired participants, these personalized trajectories were evaluated in regard to comfort, naturalness, and overall experience and compared against two standard patterns from the same database: one averaging all the trajectories, and one randomly selected. We did not find relevant differences across pattern conditions, despite all trajectories being executed with high accuracy thanks to a stiff position-derivative controller. We found, however, that pattern conditions in later trials were rated as more comfortable and natural than those in the first trial, suggesting that participants might have adapted to walking within the exoskeleton, regardless of the enforced gait pattern.

However, the squaring operation introduces additional complexity when computing the partition function or marginalizing variables, which hinders their applicability in ML. To solve this issue, canonical forms of TNs are parameterized via unitary matrices to simplify the computation of marginals. However, these canonical forms do not apply to circuits, as they can represent factorizations that do not directly map to a known TN. Inspired by the ideas of orthogonality in canonical forms and determinism in circuits enabling tractable maximization, we show how to parameterize squared circuits to overcome their marginalization overhead. Our parameterizations unlock efficient marginalization even in factorizations different from TNs, but encoded as circuits, whose structure would otherwise make marginalization computationally hard.

ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations.

While recent methods have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate commonsense reasoning and improve exploration efficiency, their planning remains constrained by textual representations, which cannot adequately capture spatial occupancy or scene geometry--critical factors for navigation decisions. We explore whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can achieve mapless visual navigation using only onboard RGB/RGB-D streams, unlocking their potential for spatial perception and planning. We achieve this through an imagination-powered navigation framework, ImagineNav++, which imagines future observation images from candidate robot views and translates navigation planning into a simple best-view image selection problem for VLMs. First, a future-view imagination module distills human navigation preferences to generate semantically meaningful viewpoints with high exploration potential. These imagined views then serve as visual prompts for the VLM to identify the most informative viewpoint. To maintain spatial consistency, we develop a selective foveation memory mechanism, which hierarchically integrates keyframe observations via a sparse-to-dense framework, constructing a compact yet comprehensive memory for long-term spatial reasoning. This approach transforms goal-oriented navigation into a series of tractable point-goal navigation tasks.

Our results in these domains show better data efficiency and overall performance in terms of both rewards and task success, with up to a 72% increase in success rate compared to existing approaches, as well as accelerated convergence (x2.1) compared to non-adaptive sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0eMPC\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u5f31", "method": "\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u5bfcMPPI\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u805a\u5408MPPI\u6837\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a2\u7d22", "result": "\u5728\u8d5b\u8f66\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u7684Acrobot\u548c\u52a0\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7684Lunar Lander\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534772%\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u52a0\u5feb2.1\u500d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb"}}

Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction.

Built upon a loosely coupled sensor fusion architecture, the system utilizes a novel hybrid Quaternion-focused Error-State EKF/UKF (Qf-ES-EKF/UKF) architecture to process inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This architecture first propagates the entire state using an Error-State Extended Kalman Filter (ESKF) and then applies a targeted Scaled Unscented Kalman Filter (SUKF) step to refine only the orientation. This sequential process blends the accuracy of SUKF in quaternion estimation with the overall computational efficiency of ESKF. The reliability of visual measurements is assessed via a dynamic sensor confidence score based on metrics, such as image entropy, intensity variation, motion blur, and inference quality, adapting the measurement noise covariance to ensure stable pose estimation even under challenging conditions. Comprehensive experimental analyses on the EuRoC MAV dataset demonstrate key advantages: an average improvement of 49% in position accuracy in challenging scenarios, an average of 57% in rotation accuracy over ESKF-based methods, and SUKF-comparable accuracy achieved with approximately 48% lower computational cost than a full SUKF implementation.

The framework identifies temporal features that most heavily influence a model's prediction by modifying the input sample and assessing its impact on the model's prediction. UniCoMTE is compatible with a wide range of model architectures and operates directly on raw time series inputs. In this study, we evaluate UniCoMTE's explanations on a time series ECG classifier. We quantify explanation quality by comparing our explanations' comprehensibility to comprehensibility of established techniques (LIME and SHAP) and assessing their generalizability to similar samples. Furthermore, clinical utility is assessed through a questionnaire completed by medical experts who review counterfactual explanations presented alongside original ECG samples.

However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)\" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction.

This work presents an improved deep learning-based navigation framework that integrates semantically enhanced depth encoding with neural motion-primitive evaluation for robust flight in cluttered forests. Several modules are incorporated on top of the original sevae-ORACLE algorithm to address limitations observed during real-world deployment, including lateral control for sharper maneuvering, a temporal consistency mechanism to suppress oscillatory planning decisions, a stereo-based visual-inertial odometry solution for drift-resilient state estimation, and a supervisory safety layer that filters unsafe actions in real time. A depth refinement stage is included to improve the representation of thin branches and reduce stereo noise, while GPU optimization increases onboard inference throughput from 4 Hz to 10 Hz.\n  The proposed approach is evaluated against several existing learning-based navigation methods under identical environmental conditions and hardware constraints. It demonstrates higher success rates, more stable trajectories, and improved collision avoidance, particularly in highly cluttered forest settings. The system is deployed on a custom quadrotor in three boreal forest environments, achieving fully autonomous completion in all flights in moderate and dense clutter, and 12 out of 15 flights in highly dense underbrush.

In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models.

We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches.

Evaluation can be broadly grouped into objective (e.g., measuring the amount of greenery) and subjective (e.g., polling the perception of people) approaches, which may differ -- what people see and feel about how green a place is might not match the measurements of the actual amount of vegetation. In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most. This location influence suggests that cultural, environmental, and experiential factors substantially shape how individuals observe greenery in cities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u5168\u7403\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c45\u4f4f\u5730\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u611f\u77e5\u7eff\u5316\u7684\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5ba2\u89c2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u5e38\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5dee\u5f02\u6210\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982GVI\uff09\u4e0e\u6765\u81ea\u4e94\u56fd1000\u4eba\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u67e5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u53e3\u3001\u5730\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u7eff\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5168\u7403\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u5c45\u4f4f\u5730\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u611f\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u5f31\uff1b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7eff\u690d\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5c45\u4f4f\u5730\u4e3a\u4e24\u5927\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57ce\u5e02\u7eff\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u6df1\u53d7\u5c45\u4f4f\u5730\u7684\u6587\u5316\u3001\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u878d\u5408\u4e3b\u89c2\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u91cd\u89c6\u5730\u57df\u6027\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Project Website: https://kinematics-aware-diffusion-policy.github.io", "summary": "Whole-body control of robotic manipulators with awareness of full-arm kinematics is crucial for many manipulation scenarios involving body collision avoidance or body-object interactions, which makes it insufficient to consider only the end-effector poses in policy learning. The typical approach for whole-arm manipulation is to learn actions in the robot's joint space. However, the unalignment between the joint space and actual task space (i.e., 3D space) increases the complexity of policy learning, as generalization in task space requires the policy to intrinsically understand the non-linear arm kinematics, which is difficult to learn from limited demonstrations. To address this issue, this letter proposes a kinematics-aware imitation learning framework with consistent task, observation, and action spaces, all represented in the same 3D space. Specifically, we represent both robot states and actions using a set of 3D points on the arm body, naturally aligned with the 3D point cloud observations. This spatially consistent representation improves the policy's sample efficiency and spatial generalizability while enabling full-body control. Built upon the diffusion policy, we further incorporate kinematics priors into the diffusion processes to guarantee the kinematic feasibility of output actions. The joint angle commands are finally calculated through an optimization-based whole-body inverse kinematics solver for execution. Simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate higher success rates and stronger spatial generalizability of our approach compared to existing methods in body-aware manipulation policy learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u8eab\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u8282\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u56e0\u5173\u8282\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e3D\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u81c2\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283D\u70b9\u96c6\u8868\u5f81\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u5173\u8282\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "3D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u8eab\u64cd\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The proposed method achieves memory efficiency comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while accumulating task saliency scores that enable curvature-aware merging without post-hoc Fisher computation. We establish convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives with approximation error bounded by gradient singular value decay. On natural language understanding benchmarks, curvature-aware parameter selection outperforms magnitude-only baselines across all sparsity levels, with multi-task merging improving over strong baselines.

The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets.

While essential for risk reduction, these mechanisms introduce slowdowns that makes cycle time estimation a hard task and impact job scheduling efficiency. Existing methods for estimating cycle times or designing schedulers often rely on predefined safety models, which may not accurately reflect real-world safety implementations, as these depend on case-specific risk assessments. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach to predict the robot's safety scaling factor directly from process execution data. We analyze multiple neural network architectures and demonstrate that a simple feed-forward network effectively estimates the robot's slowdown. This capability is crucial for improving cycle time predictions and designing more effective scheduling algorithms in collaborative robotic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6267\u884c\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u51cf\u901f\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5468\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u7b97\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5b9e\u9645\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5468\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u4f30\u7b97\u4e0d\u51c6\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u8c03\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4ece\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u51cf\u901f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5468\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their reliability is hindered by hallucinations, where models often fail to derive answers from visual evidence, instead relying on learned textual priors. Existing mitigation strategies for MedVLMs have distinct limitations: training-based methods rely on costly expert annotations, limiting scalability, while training-free interventions like contrastive decoding, though data-efficient, apply a global, untargeted correction whose effects in complex real-world clinical settings can be unreliable. To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance. Our module leverages an anatomical mask to direct a three-tiered contrastive decoding process. By dynamically re-weighting at the token, attention, and logits levels, it verifiably steers the model's focus onto specified regions, reinforcing anatomical understanding and suppressing factually incorrect outputs. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including chest X-ray, CT, brain MRI, and ocular ultrasound, demonstrate our method's effectiveness in improving regional understanding, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing overall diagnostic accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aARCD\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u975e\u9776\u5411\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff08ARCD\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89e3\u5256\u63a9\u7801\u5728\u8bcd\u5143\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548clogits\u4e09\u7ea7\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u5b9a\u5411\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u6307\u5b9a\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u3001CT\u3001\u8111MRI\u548c\u773c\u8d85\u58f0\u7b49\u591a\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cARCD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u533a\u57df\u7406\u89e3\u529b\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "ARCD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u51c6\u6291\u5236\u533b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language.

DM takes the multi-step diffusion to obtain an accurate estimation of the residual between LRMSI and HRMSI. However, the multi-step process takes large computational power and is time-consuming. As for E2E models, their performance is still limited by the lack of prior and simple structure. In this paper, we propose a novel four-stage training strategy to obtain a lightweight network Fose, which fuses one-step DM and an E2E model. We perform one-step distillation on an enhanced SOTA DM for pansharping to compress the inference process from 50 steps to only 1 step. Then we fuse the E2E model with one-step DM with lightweight ensemble blocks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed Fose on three commonly used benchmarks. Moreover, we achieve a 7.42 speedup ratio compared to the baseline DM while achieving much better performance.

How such distributed control gives rise to precise global patterns remains a central question not only in developmental biology but also in distributed robotics, programmable matter, and multi-agent learning. Here, we introduce DiffeoMorph, an end-to-end differentiable framework for learning a morphogenesis protocol that guides a population of agents to morph into a target 3D shape. Each agent updates its position and internal state using an attention-based SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network, based on its own internal state and signals received from other agents. To train this system, we introduce a new shape-matching loss based on the 3D Zernike polynomials, which compares the predicted and target shapes as continuous spatial distributions, not as discrete point clouds, and is invariant to agent ordering, number of agents, and rigid-body transformations. To enforce full SO(3) invariance -- invariant to rotations yet sensitive to reflections, we include an alignment step that optimally rotates the predicted Zernike spectrum to match the target before computing the loss. This results in a bilevel problem, with the inner loop optimizing a unit quaternion for the best alignment and the outer loop updating the agent model. We compute gradients through the alignment step using implicit differentiation. We perform systematic benchmarking to establish the advantages of our shape-matching loss over other standard distance metrics for shape comparison tasks. We then demonstrate that DiffeoMorph can form a range of shapes -- from simple ellipsoids to complex morphologies -- using only minimal spatial cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDiffeoMorph\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f62\u6210\u76ee\u68073D\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Zernike\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u65e0\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u5f62\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7269\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528SE(3)\u7b49\u53d8\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66f4\u65b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e3D Zernike\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u4f18\u65cb\u8f6c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u9690\u5f0f\u5fae\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u53cc\u5c42\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "DiffeoMorph\u80fd\u4ece\u7b80\u5355\u7403\u4f53\u5230\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u6001\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u4e14\u5f62\u72b6\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u521a\u4f53\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f62\u6001\u53d1\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u53d1\u80b2\u673a\u5236\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability.

The proposed planner integrates the dual quaternion algebra directly into an RRT* framework, thereby enabling natural screw motion interpolation in SE(3). The dual quaternion-based RRT* has been implemented in Python and demonstrated on a representative multi-obstacle scenario.

These two recent algorithmic approaches improve the performance of base optimizers, such as AdamW, through different iterate averaging strategies. Schedule-Free explicitly maintains a uniform average of past weights, while single-worker DiLoCo performs implicit averaging by periodically aggregating trajectories, called pseudo-gradients, to update the model parameters. However, single-worker DiLoCo's periodic averaging introduces a two-loop structure, increasing its memory requirements and number of hyperparameters. GPA overcomes these limitations by decoupling the interpolation constant in the primal averaging formulation of Nesterov. This decoupling enables GPA to smoothly average iterates at every step, generalizing and improving upon single-worker DiLoCo. Empirically, GPA consistently outperforms single-worker DiLoCo while removing the two-loop structure, simplifying hyperparameter tuning, and reducing its memory overhead to a single additional buffer. On the Llama-160M model, GPA provides a 24.22% speedup in terms of steps to reach the baseline (AdamW's) validation loss. Likewise, GPA achieves speedups of 12% and 27% on small and large batch setups, respectively, to attain AdamW's validation accuracy on the ImageNet ViT workload.

While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to \"overthink\" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured \"Disease, Relation, Anatomy\" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA.

Project page: https://unistatedlo.github.io", "summary": "Perception of deformable linear objects (DLOs), such as cables, ropes, and wires, is the cornerstone for successful downstream manipulation. Although vision-based methods have been extensively explored, they remain highly vulnerable to occlusions that commonly arise in constrained manipulation environments due to surrounding obstacles, large and varying deformations, and limited viewpoints. Moreover, the high dimensionality of the state space, the lack of distinctive visual features, and the presence of sensor noises further compound the challenges of reliable DLO perception. To address these open issues, this paper presents UniStateDLO, the first complete DLO perception pipeline with deep-learning methods that achieves robust performance under severe occlusion, covering both single-frame state estimation and cross-frame state tracking from partial point clouds. Both tasks are formulated as conditional generative problems, leveraging the strong capability of diffusion models to capture the complex mapping between highly partial observations and high-dimensional DLO states. UniStateDLO effectively handles a wide range of occlusion patterns, including initial occlusion, self-occlusion, and occlusion caused by multiple objects. In addition, it exhibits strong data efficiency as the entire network is trained solely on a large-scale synthetic dataset, enabling zero-shot sim-to-real generalization without any real-world training data. Comprehensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that UniStateDLO outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in both estimation and tracking, producing globally smooth yet locally precise DLO state predictions in real time, even under substantial occlusions.

Our goal is to achieve a globally stable and interference-aware channel allocation. Stability is defined through a generalized Gale-Shapley multi-to-one matching, a well-established solution concept in wireless resource allocation. We consider wireless networks where L cells share S orthogonal channels and cannot simultaneously use the same channel as their neighbors. Each channel evolves as an unknown restless Markov process with cell-dependent rewards, making this the first work to establish global Gale-Shapley stability for channel allocation in a stochastic, temporally varying restless environment. To address this challenge, we develop SMILE (Stable Multi-matching with Interference-aware LEarning), a communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm that integrates restless bandit learning with graph-constrained coordination.

(ii) We use ensemble training to fuse features from pretrained generalist encoders (e.g., SigLIP2) with our own document and web-specific representations.

When trained on narrow expert demonstrations, PaD achieves state-of-the-art 95\\% success, strongly outperforming prior methods that peak at 68\\%.

However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAOM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u6ce2\u6bb5\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u536b\u661f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6ce2\u6bb5\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "AOM\u5f15\u5165\u5149\u8c31\u72ec\u7acb\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8865\u4e01\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u9053\u63a9\u7801\u91cd\u5efa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728Sentinel-2\u3001Landsat\u3001HLS\u7b4910+\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAOM\u5728\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "AOM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u5149\u5b66\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

While simulation has become a promising way for scaling up data collection, the related tasks, including simulation task design, task-aware scene generation, expert demonstration synthesis, and sim-to-real transfer, still demand substantial human effort. We present AnyTask, an automated framework that pairs massively parallel GPU simulation with foundation models to design diverse manipulation tasks and synthesize robot data. We introduce three AnyTask agents for generating expert demonstrations aiming to solve as many tasks as possible: 1) ViPR, a novel task and motion planning agent with VLM-in-the-loop Parallel Refinement; 2) ViPR-Eureka, a reinforcement learning agent with generated dense rewards and LLM-guided contact sampling; 3) ViPR-RL, a hybrid planning and learning approach that jointly produces high-quality demonstrations with only sparse rewards. We train behavior cloning policies on generated data, validate them in simulation, and deploy them directly on real robot hardware. The policies generalize to novel object poses, achieving 44% average success across a suite of real-world pick-and-place, drawer opening, contact-rich pushing, and long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Although data-driven models have shown promise, their performance often deteriorates when the geometric structures governing long-term behavior are unknown or poorly represented. We demonstrate that a simple kernel ridge regression (KRR) framework, when combined with a dynamics-aware validation strategy, provides a strong baseline for long-term prediction of complex dynamical systems. By employing a data-driven kernel derived from diffusion maps, the proposed Diffusion Maps Kernel Ridge Regression (DM-KRR) method implicitly adapts to the intrinsic geometry of the system's invariant set, without requiring explicit manifold reconstruction or attractor modeling, procedures that often limit predictive performance. Across a broad range of systems, including smooth manifolds, chaotic attractors, and high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, DM-KRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art random feature, neural-network and operator-learning methods in both accuracy and data efficiency. These findings underscore that long-term predictive skill depends not only on model expressiveness, but critically on respecting the geometric constraints encoded in the data through dynamically consistent model selection.

As a result, predicting EV charging demand has become a timely and important research problem. While substantial research has addressed energy load forecasting in transportation, relatively few studies systematically compare multiple forecasting methods across different temporal horizons and spatial aggregation levels in diverse urban settings. This work investigates the effectiveness of five time series forecasting models, ranging from traditional statistical approaches to machine learning and deep learning methods.

A critical failure mode is \"visual forgetting\", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as \"think longer, see less\". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning \"how-to-think\") and (2) strategic visual perception (\"when-to-look\"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., \"wait\", \"verify\"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \\textbf{Code}: \\url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u201c\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\uff0c\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8fc7\u65e9\u878d\u5408\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u673a\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8bfe\u7a0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u9aa8\u5e72\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u611f\u77e5 grounded \u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08PG-CoT\uff09\u8fde\u63a5\u89c6\u89c9\uff1b3) \u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u611f\u77e5\u65f6\u673a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bcd\uff08\u5982\u201cwait\u201d\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5173\u952e\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6027 grounded \u63a8\u7406\u8005\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6280\u80fd\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, real-world QoS data are extremely sparse, noisy, and shaped by hierarchical dependencies arising from QoS interactions, and geographical and network-level factors, making accurate QoS prediction challenging. Existing methods often predict each QoS parameter separately, requiring multiple similar models, which increases computational cost and leads to poor generalization. Although recent joint QoS prediction studies have explored shared architectures, they suffer from negative transfer due to loss-scaling caused by inconsistent numerical ranges across QoS parameters and further struggle with inadequate representation learning, resulting in degraded accuracy. This paper presents an unified strategy for joint QoS prediction, called SHARP-QoS, that addresses these issues using three components. First, we introduce a dual mechanism to extract the hierarchical features from both QoS and contextual structures via hyperbolic convolution formulated in the Poincar\u00e9 ball. Second, we propose an adaptive feature-sharing mechanism that allows feature exchange across informative QoS and contextual signals. A gated feature fusion module is employed to support dynamic feature selection among structural and shared representations. Third, we design an EMA-based loss balancing strategy that allows stable joint optimization, thereby mitigating the negative transfer. Evaluations on three datasets with two, three, and four QoS parameters demonstrate that SHARP-QoS outperforms both single- and multi-task baselines.

While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage.

Submitted to ICRA 2026", "summary": "Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) is a prominent paradigm for autonomous driving, where agents are required to optimize performance under strict safety requirements. This dual objective creates a fundamental tension, as overly conservative policies limit driving efficiency while aggressive exploration risks safety violations. The Safety Representations for Safer Policy Learning (SRPL) framework addresses this challenge by equipping agents with a predictive model of future constraint violations and has shown promise in controlled environments. This paper investigates whether SRPL extends to real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Systematic experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and NuPlan demonstrate that SRPL can improve the reward-safety tradeoff, achieving statistically significant improvements in success rate (effect sizes r = 0.65-0.86) and cost reduction (effect sizes r = 0.70-0.83), with p < 0.05 for observed improvements. However, its effectiveness depends on the underlying policy optimizer and the dataset distribution.

While BSM has been successfully utilized in reinforcement learning (RL) for tasks like state representation learning and policy exploration, its application to state similarity between multiple MDPs remains challenging. Prior work has attempted to extend BSM to pairs of MDPs, but a lack of well-established mathematical properties has limited further theoretical analysis between MDPs. In this work, we formally establish a generalized bisimulation metric (GBSM) for measuring state similarity between arbitrary pairs of MDPs, which is rigorously proven with three fundamental metric properties, i.e., GBSM symmetry, inter-MDP triangle inequality, and a distance bound on identical spaces. Leveraging these properties, we theoretically analyze policy transfer, state aggregation, and sampling-based estimation across MDPs, obtaining explicit bounds that are strictly tighter than existing ones derived from the standard BSM. Additionally, GBSM provides a closed-form sample complexity for estimation, improving upon existing asymptotic results based on BSM. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of GBSM in multi-MDP scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08GBSM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u4e2aMDP\u95f4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e09\u5927\u5ea6\u91cf\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u805a\u5408\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08BSM\uff09\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2aMDP\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u4e2aMDP\u95f4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u652f\u6491\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e7f\u4e49\u53cc\u6a21\u62df\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08GBSM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u8de8MDP\u4e09\u89d2\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u548c\u540c\u6784\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u754c\u4e09\u5927\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfBSM\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u805a\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "GBSM\u4e3a\u591aMDP\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This degradation can be attributed to distribution shifts, including user, character, and dialogue compositional shifts. Existing methods like LLM-as-a-judge fall short in providing a fine-grained diagnosis of how these shifts affect RPM generalization, and thus there lack formal frameworks to characterize RPM generalization behaviors. To bridge these gaps, we introduce an information-theoretic metric, named reasoning-based effective mutual information difference (R-EMID), to measure RPM performance degradation in an interpretable way. We also derive an upper bound on R-EMID to predict the worst-case generalization performance of RPMs and theoretically reveal how various shifts contribute to the RPM performance degradation. Moreover, we propose a co-evolving reinforcement learning framework to adaptively model the connection among user, character, and dialogue context and thus enhance the estimation of dialogue response generation probability, which is critical for calculating R-EMID.

The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance.

While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated.

Classical methods for solving IDEs require repeatedly evaluating convolution integrals, whose cost increases quickly with kernel complexity and dimensionality. Existing neural solvers can accelerate selected instances of these computations, yet they do not generalize across diverse nonlocal structures. In this work, we introduce the Memory-Informed Neural Pseudo-Operator (MINPO), a unified framework for modeling nonlocal dynamics arising from long-range spatial interactions and/or long-term temporal memory. MINPO, employing either Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) or multilayer perceptron networks (MLPs) as encoders, learns the nonlocal operator and its inverse directly through neural representations, and then explicitly reconstruct the unknown solution fields. The learning is guarded by a lightweight nonlocal consistency loss term to enforce coherence between the learned operator and reconstructed solution. The MINPO formulation allows to naturally capture and efficiently resolve nonlocal spatiotemporal dependencies governed by a wide spectrum of IDEs and their subsets, including fractional PDEs. We evaluate the efficacy of MINPO in comparison with classical techniques and state-of-the-art neural-based strategies based on MLPs, such as A-PINN and fPINN, along with their newly-developed KAN variants, A-PIKAN and fPIKAN, designed to facilitate a fair comparison. Our study offers compelling evidence of the accuracy of MINPO and demonstrates its robustness in handling (i) diverse kernel types, (ii) different kernel dimensionalities, and (iii) the substantial computational demands arising from repeated evaluations of kernel integrals.

A Dual Attention Feature Fusion (DAFF) module is also introduced to effectively merge skip-connected and semantic features, improving contextual consistency.Extensive experiments on two public BUS datasets demonstrate that WDFFU-Mamba achieves superior segmentation accuracy, significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of Dice coefficient and 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95).The combination of wavelet-domain enhancement and attention-based fusion greatly improves both the accuracy and robustness of BUS image segmentation, while maintaining computational efficiency.The proposed WDFFU-Mamba model not only delivers strong segmentation performance but also exhibits desirable generalization ability across datasets, making it a promising solution for real-world clinical applications in breast tumor ultrasound analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWDFFU-Mamba\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c0f\u6ce2\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u56e0\u6591\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6a21\u7cca\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9ad8\u6548\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWDFFU-Mamba\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53bb\u566a\u9ad8\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\uff08WHF\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff08DAFF\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eU\u578bMamba\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u4e73\u817a\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWDFFU-Mamba\u5728Dice\u7cfb\u6570\u548cHD95\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Clinical assessments are expensive and invasive, leaving ground truth labels available for only a fraction of neuroimaging datasets. We introduce Multi view Adaptive Transport Clustering for Heterogeneous Alzheimer's Disease (MATCH-AD), a semi supervised framework that integrates deep representation learning, graph-based label propagation, and optimal transport theory to address this limitation. The framework leverages manifold structure in neuroimaging data to propagate diagnostic information from limited labeled samples to larger unlabeled populations, while using Wasserstein distances to quantify disease progression between cognitive states. Evaluated on nearly five thousand subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, encompassing structural MRI measurements from hundreds of brain regions, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, and clinical variables MATCHAD achieves near-perfect diagnostic accuracy despite ground truth labels for less than one-third of subjects. The framework substantially outperforms all baseline methods, achieving kappa indicating almost perfect agreement compared to weak agreement for the best baseline, a qualitative transformation in diagnostic reliability. Performance remains clinically useful even under severe label scarcity, and we provide theoretical convergence guarantees with proven bounds on label propagation error and transport stability.

However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVLMIR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u534f\u540c\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6062\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u7528VLM\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u9f50 caption \u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u7528\u9000\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u4e92\u8865\u5d4c\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f15\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u9000\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408VLM\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

The criterion uses graph theory for representing and decomposing models for structure-local explanation, and recomposing them into global explanations. We form the structure-local explanations as annotations, a verifiable hypothesis-evidence structure that allows for a range of explanatory methods to be used. This criterion matches existing intuitions on inherent explainability, and provides justifications why a large regression model may not be explainable but a sparse neural network could be. We differentiate explainable -- a model that allows for explanation -- and \\textit{explained} -- one that has a verified explanation. Finally, we provide a full explanation of PREDICT -- a Cox proportional hazards model of cardiovascular disease risk, which is in active clinical use in New Zealand.

To address these challenges, we present HiSIR-Net, a High resolution, Self-supervised Reconstruction framework for pixel-wise PCBA localization. Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate. To bridge the gap in high-resolution PCBA datasets, we further contribute a self-collected dataset named SIPCBA-500 of 500 images.

Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:\n  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms\n  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)\n  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba\n  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ICL\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u673a\u5236\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4e14\u524d\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08ICL\uff09\u4e2d\u4e3a\u4f55\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u5c06ICL\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fee\u8865\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u57289\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u30017\u79cdTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u53caMamba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u53cc\u91cd\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f100%\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed1\u5b9a62%\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u524d\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff08rho=-0.596\uff09\uff1b\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6240\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u901a\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "ICL\u662f\u53cc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u65e0\u5148\u9a8c\u65f6\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bef\u8def\u7531\u5e72\u6270\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8f93\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProCache\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728PixArt-alpha\u548cDiT\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad82.9\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u8d28\u91cf\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u56fa\u5b9a\u7f13\u5b58\u95f4\u9694\u548c\u6734\u7d20\u91cd\u7528\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5339\u914dDiT\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u4e25\u91cd\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProCache\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c(2) \u6df1\u5c42\u5757\u4e0e\u9ad8\u91cd\u8981\u6027token\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728PixArt-alpha\u548cDiT\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b01.96x\u548c2.90x\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ProCache\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3aDiT\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The algorithm adjusts pruning rates based on recent model performance, allowing each cloudlet to focus on regions experiencing traffic changes without compromising accuracy.

As large-scale PBR texture datasets are scarce, our approach focuses on effectively leveraging the embedding space and diffusion priors of pretrained latent image generative models while learning a material latent space, MatLat, through targeted fine-tuning. Unlike prior methods that freeze the embedding network and thus lead to distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels and hinder subsequent diffusion training, we fine-tune the pretrained VAE so that new material channels can be incorporated with minimal latent distribution deviation. We further show that correspondence-aware attention alone is insufficient for cross-view consistency unless the latent-to-image mapping preserves locality. To enforce this locality, we introduce a regularization in the VAE fine-tuning that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns the corresponding image regions to maintain strong pixel-latent spatial correspondence.

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG.

We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks.

To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern.

We suggest a new activation module where the DReLU operation is only performed on a subset of the channels (Prototype channels), while the rest of the channels (replicate channels) replicates the DReLU of each of their neurons from the corresponding neurons in one of the prototype channels. We then extend this idea to work across different layers.\n  We show that this formulation can drastically reduce the number of DReLU operations in resnet type network. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis shows that this new formulation can solve an extended version of the XOR problem, using just one non-linearity and two neurons, something that traditional formulations and some PI specific methods cannot achieve.

We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning.

Performing such analyses in a statistically rigorous manner is non-trivial, however. Appropriate performance metrics must be selected that allow for valid comparisons between groups of different sample sizes and base rates; metric uncertainty must be determined and multiple comparisons be corrected for, in order to assess whether any observed differences may be purely due to chance; and in the case of intersectional analyses, mechanisms must be implemented to find the most `interesting' subgroups within combinatorially many subgroup combinations. We here present a statistical toolbox that addresses these challenges and enables practitioners to easily yet rigorously assess their models for potential subgroup performance disparities. While broadly applicable, the toolbox is specifically designed for medical imaging applications. The analyses provided by the toolbox are illustrated in two case studies, one in skin lesion malignancy classification on the ISIC2020 dataset and one in chest X-ray-based disease classification on the MIMIC-CXR dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e9a\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u7387\u7684\u4e9a\u7ec4\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u5957\u7edf\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u591a\u91cd\u6bd4\u8f83\u6821\u6b63\u53ca\u4ea4\u96c6\u4e9a\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u5728ISIC2020\u548cMIMIC-CXR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e9a\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faADK\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u56fe\u50cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u867d\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "ADK\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u7528LLM\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u522b\u63cf\u8ff0\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u8868\u793a\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u8f7b\u91cf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdPEFT\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0SOTA\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3a\u65e0\u53c2\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "conclusion": "ADK\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u5347VLM\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u727a\u7272\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The model employs independent proximal policy optimization, which was selected for suitability to the decentralized and competitive environment. Nevertheless, given the inherent challenges of independent learning in multi-agent settings, an extensive hyperparameter search ensures that decentralized training yields market outcomes consistent with competitive behavior. The model is applied to a stylized version of the Italian electricity system and tested under varying levels of competition, market designs, and policy scenarios. Results highlight the critical role of market design for decarbonizing the electricity sector and avoiding price volatility.

However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios.

However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright). Our results show that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts (i.e., generating the erased concept when it is indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts (i.e., failing to generate non-targeted concepts resembling the erased one), while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.", "AI": {"tldr": "EMMA\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e94\u7ef4\u6311\u6218\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u6027\u522b\u4e0e\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9690\u5f0f\u5f15\u7528\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEMMA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d612\u9879\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u3001\u540d\u4eba\u3001\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u3001NSFW\u548c\u7248\u6743\u4e94\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u6613\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u52a0\u5267\u6027\u522b\u4e0e\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u6280\u672f\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u5e73\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds.

Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDESSERT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e27\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u56e0\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u867d\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u53d8\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u7a7a\u6d1e\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDESSERT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Stable Diffusion\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u4ef6-\u6b8b\u5dee\u5bf9\u9f50VAE\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u5f15\u5165DLT\u65f6\u5e8f\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDESSERT\u5728\u5e27\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Collaborative Forward-Forward (CFF) learning, extending the original algorithm through inter-layer cooperation mechanisms that preserve forward-only computation while enabling global context integration. Our framework implements two collaborative paradigms: Fixed CFF (F-CFF) with constant inter-layer coupling and Adaptive CFF (A-CFF) with learnable collaboration parameters that evolve during training. The collaborative goodness function incorporates weighted contributions from all layers, enabling coordinated feature learning while maintaining memory efficiency and biological plausibility. Comprehensive evaluation on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST demonstrates significant performance improvements over baseline Forward-Forward implementations.

However, traditional explicit warping approaches often struggle with accurate motion transfer or recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based warping methods, though effective, frequently suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow.

OmniDirectional Image Super-Resolution (ODISR) is a promising technique for enhancing the visual quality of ODIs. Before performing super-resolution, ODIs are typically projected from a spherical surface onto a plane using EquiRectangular Projection (ERP). This projection introduces latitude-dependent geometric distortion in ERP images: distortion is minimal near the equator but becomes severe toward the poles, where image content is stretched across a wider area. However, existing ODISR methods have limited sampling ranges and feature extraction capabilities, which hinder their ability to capture distorted patterns over large areas. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-level Distortion-aware Deformable Network (MDDN) for ODISR, designed to expand the sampling range and receptive field. Specifically, the feature extractor in MDDN comprises three parallel branches: a deformable attention mechanism (serving as the dilation=1 path) and two dilated deformable convolutions with dilation rates of 2 and 3. This architecture expands the sampling range to include more distorted patterns across wider areas, generating dense and comprehensive features that effectively capture geometric distortions in ERP images. The representations extracted from these deformable feature extractors are adaptively fused in a multi-level feature fusion module. Furthermore, to reduce computational cost, a low-rank decomposition strategy is applied to dilated deformable convolutions. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that MDDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and superiority in ODISR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7ea7\u7578\u53d8\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MDDN\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5168\u5411\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfERP\u6295\u5f71\u5bfc\u81f4\u6781\u5730\u533a\u57df\u4e25\u91cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7578\u53d8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u6837\u8303\u56f4\u5c0f\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u7578\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1MDDN\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u6761\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u652f\uff1a\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08dilation=1\uff09\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u81a8\u80c0\u7387\u4e3a2\u30013\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMDDN\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347ODISR\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "MDDN\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5927\u91c7\u6837\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7578\u53d8\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5168\u5411\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u4e3aAR/VR\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process.

Our aim is to delve into a journey towards unified network embeddings that are both comprehensive and powerful, capable of characterizing network structures and adeptly handling the diverse tasks that graph analysis offers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8868\u5f81\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u4f20\u9012\u6027\u4e0e\u5e73\u8861\u7406\u8bba\u7b49\u7f51\u7edc\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u793e\u533a\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u6781\u7aef\u8282\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose the Affective Image Filter (AIF) task, which aims to reflect visually-abstract emotions from text into visually-concrete images, thereby creating emotionally compelling results. We first introduce the AIF dataset and the formulation of the AIF models. Then, we present AIF-B as an initial attempt based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

RadImageNet-VQA is built from expert-curated annotations and provides 750K images paired with 7.5M question-answer samples. It covers three key tasks - abnormality detection, anatomy recognition, and pathology identification - spanning eight anatomical regions and 97 pathology categories, and supports open-ended, closed-ended, and multiple-choice questions. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models still struggle with fine-grained pathology identification, particularly in open-ended settings and even after fine-tuning.

However, this performance is often dependent on the presence of large and varied datasets. In some settings, like in the medical domain, data is often fragmented across parties, and cannot be readily shared. While federated learning addresses this situation, it is a solution that requires synchronicity of parties training a single model together, exchanging information about model weights. We investigate how asynchronous collaboration, where only already trained models are shared (e.g. as part of a publication), affects performance, and propose to use stitching as a method for combining models.\n  Through taking a multi-objective perspective, where performance on each parties' data is viewed independently, we find that training solely on a single parties' data results in similar performance when merging with another parties' data, when considering performance on that single parties' data, while performance on other parties' data is notably worse. Moreover, while an ensemble of such individually trained networks generalizes better, performance on each parties' own dataset suffers. We find that combining intermediate representations in individually trained models with a well placed pair of stitching layers allows this performance to recover to a competitive degree while maintaining improved generalization, showing that asynchronous collaboration can yield competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u62fc\u63a5\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u5171\u4eab\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96be\u4ee5\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u8981\u6c42\u540c\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u63a2\u7d22\u4ec5\u5171\u4eab\u5df2\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u62fc\u63a5\u5c42\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u6784\u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u89d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672c\u65b9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u4f46\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6cdb\u5316\u66f4\u597d\u4f46\u672c\u65b9\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u62fc\u63a5\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6cdb\u5316\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u672c\u65b9\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f02\u6b65\u534f\u4f5c\u7ed3\u5408\u62fc\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u673a\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

However, for their outputs to get accepted in practice, the results they provide should be explainable in a way easily understood by pathologists. A well-known and widely used explanation technique is occlusion, which, however, can take a long time to compute, thus slowing the development and interaction with pathologists. In this work, we set out to find a faster replacement for occlusion in a successful system for detecting prostate cancer. Since there is no established framework for comparing the performance of various explanation methods, we first identified suitable comparison criteria and selected corresponding metrics. Based on the results, we were able to choose a different explanation method, which cut the previously required explanation time at least by a factor of 10, without any negative impact on the quality of outputs. This speedup enables rapid iteration in model development and debugging and brings us closer to adopting AI-assisted prostate cancer detection in clinical settings.

Firstly, we consider the case of neural networks with a single hidden layer and we derive an integral infinite width neural representation that generalizes existing continuous neural networks (CNNs) representations. Then we extend this to deep residual CNNs that have a finite number of integral hidden layers and residual connections. Secondly, we revisit the relation between neural ODEs and deep residual NNs and we formalize approximation errors via discretization techniques. Then, we merge these two approaches into a unified homogeneous representation of NNs as a Distributed Parameter neural Network (DiPaNet) and we show that most of the existing finite and infinite-dimensional NNs architectures are related via homogeneization/discretization with the DiPaNet representation. Our approach is purely deterministic and applies to general, uniformly continuous matrix weight functions.

While hard prioritization methods inspired by finite element methods are widely adopted, recent research suggests that easy prioritization can also be effective. Nevertheless, we find that both approaches exhibit notable trade-offs and inconsistent performance across PDE types. To address this issue, we develop a hybrid strategy that combines the strengths of hard and easy prioritization through an alternating training algorithm. On PDEs with steep gradients, nonlinearity, and high dimensionality, the proposed method achieves consistently high accuracy, with relative L2 errors mostly in the range of O(10^-5) to O(10^-6), significantly surpassing baseline methods. Moreover, it offers greater reliability across diverse problems, whereas compared approaches often suffer from variable accuracy depending on the PDE.

Specifically, an Object Grounding Agent establishes correspondence between free-form text descriptions and target object nodes in the scene graph; a Behavior Editing Agent generates multi-object trajectories from language instructions; and a Behavior Reviewer Agent iteratively reviews and refines the generated trajectories. The edited scene graph is rendered and then refined using a video diffusion tool to address artifacts introduced by object insertion and significant view changes. LangDriveCTRL supports both object node editing (removal, insertion and replacement) and multi-object behavior editing from a single natural-language instruction. Quantitatively, it achieves nearly $2\\times$ higher instruction alignment than the previous SoTA, with superior structural preservation, photorealism, and traffic realism.

In realistic settings, interventions are rarely isolated: organizations need to align sequences of interventions to jointly steer the outcome of a case. Existing PresPM approaches fall short in this respect. Many focus on a single intervention decision, while others treat multiple interventions independently, ignoring how they interact over time. Methods that do address these dependencies depend either on simulation or data augmentation to approximate the process to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, which can create a reality gap and introduce bias. We introduce SCOPE, a PresPM approach that learns aligned sequential intervention recommendations. SCOPE employs backward induction to estimate the effect of each candidate intervention action, propagating its impact from the final decision point back to the first. By leveraging causal learners, our method can utilize observational data directly, unlike methods that require constructing process approximations for reinforcement learning. Experiments on both an existing synthetic dataset and a new semi-synthetic dataset show that SCOPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PresPM techniques in optimizing the KPI.

Despite significant advances, current textured mesh scene reconstruction methods are far from artist ready, suffering from incorrect object decomposition, inaccurate spatial relationships, and missing backgrounds. We present 3D-RE-GEN, a compositional framework that reconstructs a single image into textured 3D objects and a background. We show that combining state of the art models from specific domains achieves state of the art scene reconstruction performance, addressing artists' requirements.\n  Our reconstruction pipeline integrates models for asset detection, reconstruction, and placement, pushing certain models beyond their originally intended domains. Obtaining occluded objects is treated as an image editing task with generative models to infer and reconstruct with scene level reasoning under consistent lighting and geometry. Unlike current methods, 3D-RE-GEN generates a comprehensive background that spatially constrains objects during optimization and provides a foundation for realistic lighting and simulation tasks in visual effects and games. To obtain physically realistic layouts, we employ a novel 4-DoF differentiable optimization that aligns reconstructed objects with the estimated ground plane. 3D-RE-GEN~achieves state of the art performance in single image 3D scene reconstruction, producing coherent, modifiable scenes through compositional generation guided by precise camera recovery and spatial optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "3D-RE-GEN\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u53ef\u4fee\u6539\u76843D\u7eb9\u7406\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6e38\u620f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7f3a\u5931\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u8d44\u4ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u653e\u7f6e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e4-DoF\u53ef\u5fae\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u5730\u9762\u5e73\u9762\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u56fe3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u53ef\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5b8c\u6574\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u5408\u7406\u5149\u7167\u3002", "conclusion": "3D-RE-GEN\u901a\u8fc7 compositional \u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines.

However, most existing feature selection approaches either operate as multi-stage pipelines or rely on post hoc feature attribution, making selection and prediction weakly coupled. In this work, we present YOTO (you only train once), an end-to-end framework that jointly identifies discrete gene subsets and performs prediction within a single differentiable architecture. In our model, the prediction task directly guides which genes are selected, while the learned subsets, in turn, shape the predictive representation. This closed feedback loop enables the model to iteratively refine both what it selects and how it predicts during training. Unlike existing approaches, YOTO enforces sparsity so that only the selected genes contribute to inference, eliminating the need to train additional downstream classifiers.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGroundingME\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u80fd\u529b\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u62d2\u8bc6\u672a\u63a5\u5730\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u5927\u91cf\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u90e8\u5206\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a5\u5730\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaGroundingME\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1005\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u533a\u5206\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u906e\u6321/\u5fae\u5c0f\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u62d2\u8bc6\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u5730\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f3025\u4e2aSOTA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8fbe45.1%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62d2\u8bc6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5f970%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u5e7b\u89c9\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u63a5\u5730\u8fbe2.9%\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u62d2\u8bc6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece0%\u63d0\u5347\u81f327.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "GroundingME\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u8fdc\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a5\u5730\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u9677\u4e0e\u63a8\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks.

The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.\n  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).\n  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.\n  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes. This first openly available digital pathology dataset from the Middle East supports further research into globally equitable AI pathology.\n  Funding: SciLifeLab and Wallenberg Data Driven Life Science Program, Instrumentarium Science Foundation, Karolinska Institutet Research Foundation.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u4e1c\u524d\u5217\u817a\u764c\u75c5\u7406\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u75c5\u7406\u533b\u751f\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u53ef\u652f\u6301\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u7684AI\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u75c5\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u7f8e\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e2d\u4e1c\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u5730\u533a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5730\u533a\u66f4\u9700\u8981AI\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f0a\u62c9\u514b\u5e93\u5c14\u5fb7\u65af\u5766\u5730\u533a339\u4f8b\u524d\u5217\u817a\u6d3b\u68c0\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7aef\u5230\u7aefAI\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u75c5\u7406\u533b\u751f\u5224\u65ad\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u79cd\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "AI\u4e0e\u75c5\u7406\u533b\u751f\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08Kappa=0.801\uff09\u4e0e\u533b\u751f\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08Kappa=0.799\uff09\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8de8\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5747\u9ad8\u4e8e0.90\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8bbe\u5907\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u5728\u524d\u5217\u817a\u75c5\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u7684\u516c\u5e73AI\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2d\u4e1c\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u5b57\u75c5\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading.

We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space. Using class-agnostic binary masks derived from OV-SAM, SPAR promotes structured and foreground-focused activations by guiding the network toward object regions. IRPL (Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling) complements SPAR by promoting balanced and noise-tolerant learning under severe foreground-background imbalance. Guided by a theoretical analysis that connects these designs to tighter localization and classification error bounds, FALCON-SFOD achieves competitive performance across SFOD benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "FALCON-SFOD\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u6e90\u57df\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709SFOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56Mean-Teacher\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4f46\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u5f81\u5f31\u5316\uff0c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5f3a\u5316", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFALCON-SFOD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bSPAR\uff08\u5229\u7528OV-SAM\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u63a9\u7801\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u524d\u666f\u805a\u7126\uff09\u548cIRPL\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7406\u8bba\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aSFOD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd tighter \u5730\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u524d\u666f\u805a\u7126\u80fd\u529b\u6bd4\u5355\u7eaf\u4f18\u5316\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0cFALCON-SFOD\u4e3a\u65e0\u6e90\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f"}}

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical approach for effectively adapting LMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods face two primary challenges: (1) High resource cost. Although PEFT methods significantly reduce resource demands compared to full fine-tuning, it still requires substantial time and memory, making it impractical in resource-constrained environments. (2) Parameter dependency. PEFT methods heavily rely on updating a subset of parameters associated with LMs to incorporate task-specific knowledge. Yet, due to increasing competition in the LMs landscape, many companies have adopted closed-source policies for their leading models, offering access only via Application Programming Interface (APIs). Whereas, the expense is often cost-prohibitive and difficult to sustain, as the fine-tuning process of LMs is extremely slow. Even if small models perform far worse than LMs in general, they can achieve superior results on particular distributions while requiring only minimal resources. Motivated by this insight, we propose Easy Adaptation (EA), which designs Specific Small Models (SSMs) to complement the underfitted data distribution for LMs. Extensive experiments show that EA matches the performance of PEFT on diverse tasks without accessing LM parameters, and requires only minimal resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEasy Adaptation\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u8865\u5145\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230PEFT\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u800c\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578bAPI\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSMs\uff09\u6765\u8865\u8db3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0ePEFT\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "Easy Adaptation\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

To do so, several works completely replace ID embeddings with modality embeddings, claiming that modality embeddings render ID embeddings unnecessary because they can match or even exceed ID embedding performance. On the other hand, many works jointly utilize ID and modality features, but posit that complex fusion strategies, such as multi-stage training and/or intricate alignment architectures, are necessary for this joint utilization. However, underlying both these lines of work is a lack of understanding of the complementarity of ID and modality features. In this work, we address this gap by studying the complementarity of ID- and text-based SR models.

Previous straightforward solutions combine feed-forward reconstruction with Gaussian heads but suffer from fixed input views and insufficient 3D training data. In contrast, we propose a 3D-annotation-free training framework for 2D-to-3D lifting from arbitrary uncalibrated and unposed multi-view images. Since the framework does not require 3D annotations, we can leverage large-scale video data with easily obtained 2D instance information to enrich semantic embedding. We also propose an instance-guided contrastive learning to align 2D semantics with the 3D representations. In addition, to mitigate the high memory and computational cost of dense views, we further propose a geometry-semantic hierarchical sparsification strategy. Our FLEG efficiently reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussian representation in a feed-forward manner from arbitrary sparse or dense views, jointly producing accurate geometry, high-fidelity appearance, and language-aligned semantics.

These methods are typically formulated via overdamped or underdamped Ornstein--Uhlenbeck-type stochastic differential equations, in which sampling is driven by a combination of deterministic drift and Brownian diffusion, resulting in continuous particle trajectories in the ambient space. While such dynamics enjoy exponential convergence guarantees for strongly log-concave target distributions, it is well known that their mixing rates deteriorate exponentially in the presence of nonconvex or multimodal landscapes, such as double-well potentials. Since many practical generative modeling tasks involve highly non-log-concave target distributions, considerable recent effort has been devoted to developing sampling schemes that improve exploration beyond classical diffusion dynamics.\n  A promising line of work leverages tools from information geometry to augment diffusion-based samplers with controlled mass reweighting mechanisms. This perspective leads naturally to Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometries, which couple transport in the sample space with vertical (reaction) dynamics on the space of probability measures. In this work, we formulate such reweighting mechanisms through the introduction of explicit correction terms and show how they can be implemented via weighted stochastic differential equations using the Feynman--Kac representation.

However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images.

Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be sensitive to noise. We propose a regularized random Fourier feature (RRFF) approach, coupled with a finite element reconstruction map (RRFF-FEM), for learning operators from noisy data. The method uses random features drawn from multivariate Student's $t$ distributions, together with frequency-weighted Tikhonov regularization that suppresses high-frequency noise. We establish high-probability bounds on the extreme singular values of the associated random feature matrix and show that when the number of features $N$ scales like $m \\log m$ with the number of training samples $m$, the system is well-conditioned, which yields estimation and generalization guarantees. Detailed numerical experiments on benchmark PDE problems, including advection, Burgers', Darcy flow, Helmholtz, Navier-Stokes, and structural mechanics, demonstrate that RRFF and RRFF-FEM are robust to noise and achieve improved performance with reduced training time compared to the unregularized random feature model, while maintaining competitive accuracy relative to kernel and neural operator tests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08RRFF-FEM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u5143t\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9891\u7387\u52a0\u6743Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8026\u5408\u6709\u9650\u5143\u91cd\u6784\u6620\u5c04\uff08RRFF-FEM\uff09\u6765\u6291\u5236\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u7279\u5f81\u6570N ~ m log m\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u826f\u6001\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u591a\u4e2aPDE\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6297\u566a\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RRFF-FEM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4e0e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7ade\u4e89\u3002"}}

However, most prior work extends these networks to predict additional Gaussian parameters -- orientation, scale, opacity, and appearance -- while relying almost exclusively on view-synthesis supervision. We show that a view-synthesis loss alone is insufficient to recover geometrically meaningful splats in this setting. We analyze and address the ambiguities of learning 3D Gaussian splats under self-supervision for pose-free generalizable splatting, and introduce G3Splat, which enforces geometric priors to obtain geometrically consistent 3D scene representations.

In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS. The unified model achieved an average Dice score of 88.65\\% for pre-operative meningiomas, 80.08% for pre-operative metastasis, 90.92% for pre-operative and 84.60% for post-operative gliomas from BraTS, and 84.47% for pre-operative and 61.27\\% for post-operative lower grade gliomas. In addition, the results showed that the unified model achieved comparable segmentation performance to the dataset specific models on their respective datasets, and enables generalization across tumor types and acquisition time points, which facilitates the deployment in a clinical setting.

However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the parameter-sharing mechanism enforces aligned feature representations, facilitating precise geometric transformations, texture preservation, and seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate that RoomEditor++ is superior over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and human preference studies, while highlighting its strong generalization to unseen indoor scenes and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video.

In this work, we assess fairness along two complementary dimensions: (1) whether challenge datasets are representative of real-world clinical diversity, and (2) whether they are accessible and legally reusable in line with the FAIR principles. To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity.

Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHeadHunt-VAD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u6316\u6398\u51bb\u7ed3MLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u5fae\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9c81\u68d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u591a\u51c6\u5219\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u4f46\u5224\u522b\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5934\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6253\u5206\u5668\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u5927VAD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MLLM\u4e2d\u5934\u90e8\u63a2\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528MLLM\u5185\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations. To mitigate this instability, we curate existing datasets to create VPBench, a larger visually prompted benchmark with 16 visual marker variants.

Especially models with multiple outputs that can separately predict segmentation classes (regions) without relying on a probabilistic formulation of the segmentation of regions. These models allow for more precise segmentation by tailoring the network's components to each class (region). They have a common encoder part of the architecture but branch out at the output layers, leading to improved accuracy.\n  These methods are used to diagnose type B aortic dissection (TBAD), which requires accurate segmentation of aortic structures based on the ImageTBDA dataset, which contains 100 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. These images identify three key classes: true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) of the aorta, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment decisions. In the dataset, 68 examples have a false lumen, while the remaining 32 do not, creating additional complexity for pathology detection.\n  However, implementing these CNN methods requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data. Obtaining accurate labels for the regions of interest can be an expensive and time-consuming process, particularly for 3D data. Semi-supervised learning methods allow models to be trained by using both labeled and unlabeled data, which is a promising approach for overcoming the challenge of obtaining accurate labels.

We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder.

We propose a physics-informed, self-supervised framework for qMRI super-resolution that uses routinely acquired HR weighted MRI (wMRI) scans as guidance, thus, removing the necessity for HR qMRI ground truth during training. We formulate super-resolution as Bayesian maximum a posteriori inference, minimizing two discrepancies: (1) between HR images synthesized from super-resolved qMRI maps and acquired wMRI guides via forward signal models, and (2) between acquired LR qMRI and downsampled predictions. This physics-informed objective allows the models to learn from clinical wMRI without HR qMRI supervision. To validate the concept, we generate training data by synthesizing wMRI guides from HR qMRI using signal equations, then degrading qMRI resolution via k-space truncation. A deep neural network learns the super-resolution mapping. Ablation experiments demonstrate that T1-weighted images primarily enhance T1 maps, T2-weighted images improve T2 maps, and combined guidance optimally enhances all parameters simultaneously. Validation on independently acquired in-vivo data from a different qMRI sequence confirms cross-qMRI sequence generalizability. Models trained on synthetic data can produce super-resolved maps from a 1-minute acquisition with quality comparable to a 5-minute reference scan, leveraging the scanner-independent nature of relaxometry parameters.

Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion.

Existing methods operate under a closed-world assumption, treating the task as a classification problem over a small, predefined verb set, which struggles to generalize to the long-tail of unseen or ambiguous interactions in the wild. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \\GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem. To bridge the vision and cognitive, we first extract hybrid interaction representations, then design a lightweight learnable cognitive steering conduit (CSC) module to inject the fine-grained visual evidence into a frozen MLLM for effective reasoning. To address the supervision mismatch between classification-based HOI datasets and open-vocabulary generative models, we introduce a hybrid guidance strategy that coupling the language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss, enabling discriminative grounding without sacrificing generative flexibility.

Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training.

These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed.

The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation.

Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology", "AI": {"tldr": "MambaMIL+\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u6539\u8fdbMIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728WSI\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406WSI\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0cMamba\u867d\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u9650\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8870\u51cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMambaMIL+\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u53e0\u626b\u63cf\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6761\u5e26\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801(S2PE)\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9(CTS)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0e\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u914dResNet-50\u3001PLIP\u548cCONCH\u4e09\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "MambaMIL+\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3WSI\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

A key challenge is generalization, as detectors trained on a narrow class of generators often fail when confronted with unseen models. In this work, we address the pressing need for generalizable detection by leveraging large vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to identify synthetic content across diverse generative techniques. First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios.

To this end, we propose Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer (ViT) network that directly regresses NPHM parameters, given a single image as input. Compared to existing approaches, the neural parametric space allows our method to reconstruct more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions. For broad generalization, we exploit domain-specific ViTs as backbones, which are pretrained on geometric prediction tasks. We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps.

Various stereo-camera based 3D localization methods are available but are limited to few hundreds of meters' range. This is majorly due to the limitation of the distortion models assumed for the non-linearities present in the camera lens. This paper presents a framework for modeling a suitable distortion model that can be used for localizing the objects at longer distances. It is well known that neural networks can be a better alternative to model a highly complex non-linear lens distortion function; on contrary, it is observed that a direct application of neural networks to distortion models fails to converge to estimate the camera parameters. To resolve this, a hybrid approach is presented in this paper where the conventional distortion models are initially extended to incorporate higher-order terms and then enhanced using neural network based residual correction model. This hybrid approach has substantially improved long-range localization performance and is capable of estimating the 3D position of objects at distances up to 5 kilometres. The estimated 3D coordinates are transformed to GIS coordinates and are plotted on a GIS map for visualization.

Existing methods mainly fall into two categories: (1) static world generation models, which construct 3D environments without active agents, and (2) controllable-entity models, which allow a single entity to perform limited actions in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters.

We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.\n  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes.

In this study, we present a simulation-driven denoising framework that combines a statistically grounded noise model with deep learning to enhance Raman spectra acquired under fluorescence-dominated conditions. We comprehensively modeled major noise sources. Based on this model, we generated biologically realistic Raman spectra and used them to train a cascaded deep neural network designed to jointly suppress stochastic detector noise and fluorescence baseline interference.

At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate.

This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision.

However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.\n  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.\n  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDexterous World Model\uff08DWM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9759\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u62df", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\u7f3a\u4e4f embodied interactivity\uff0c\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u624b\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316", "method": "DWM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u573a\u666f-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u81ea\u62cd\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210", "result": "DWM\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5982\u6293\u53d6\u3001\u6253\u5f00\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u673a\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027", "conclusion": "DWM\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u81ea\u62cd\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5177\u8eab\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84"}}

To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u6784\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7d27\u51d1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\u4e24\u5927\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49-\u50cf\u7d20\u91cd\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4ec596\u901a\u9053\u300116x16\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u9762\u5411\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002"}}
