Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视觉-语言模型的轻量级评估框架，通过多模态特征聚类预测短视频教育内容的用户参与度，超越传统指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法如VideoScore-2仅关注视觉与语义保真度，无法捕捉音频视觉属性对真实用户参与的影响。

Method: 利用VLM提取无监督多模态特征，聚类为可解释因子，并训练回归模型预测教育类短视频的参与度，基于自建YouTube Shorts数据集验证。

Result: 预测结果与真实参与度高度相关，所提方法在可解释性与可扩展性上优于SSIM、FID等传统指标。

Conclusion: 通过融合多模态特征重要性与人类参与信号，该框架推动了鲁棒且可解释的视频理解发展。

Abstract: Evaluating short-form video content requires moving beyond surface-level quality metrics toward human-aligned, multimodal reasoning. While existing frameworks like VideoScore-2 assess visual and semantic fidelity, they do not capture how specific audiovisual attributes drive real audience engagement. In this work, we propose a data-driven evaluation framework that uses Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to extract unsupervised audiovisual features, clusters them into interpretable factors, and trains a regression-based evaluator to predict engagement on short-form edutainment videos. Our curated YouTube Shorts dataset enables systematic analysis of how VLM-derived features relate to human engagement behavior. Experiments show strong correlations between predicted and actual engagement, demonstrating that our lightweight, feature-based evaluator provides interpretable and scalable assessments compared to traditional metrics (e.g., SSIM, FID). By grounding evaluation in both multimodal feature importance and human-centered engagement signals, our approach advances toward robust and explainable video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF)，通过神经网络融合工具输出而非文本，提升医学图像理解性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的工具组合方法在医学图像中表现不佳，因关键信息为空间局部特征，难以通过文本融合

Method: TBF使用医疗VLM选择工具，由学习的Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM)神经网络融合工具输出，实现非文本的组合

Result: 在组织病理学和皮肤病学任务中，TBF性能与或优于深度学习模型、VLM及现有工具框架，尤其在数据有限时优势明显

Conclusion: TBF提升了医学图像工具使用的性能与可解释性，为临床可解释预测提供了新范式

Abstract: Recent tool-use frameworks powered by vision-language models (VLMs) improve image understanding by grounding model predictions with specialized tools. Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes. Our code is available at https://github.com/christinaliu2020/tool-bottleneck-framework.

*Nairouz Mrabah,Mohamed Bouguessa,Sihem Sami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDSNet通过 landmark 近似和联合优化实现 O(n) 复杂度的可扩展深度子空间聚类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统子空间聚类方法因 O(n³) 计算成本难以扩展，深度学习方法仍受限于成对相似性计算

Method: 采用基于地标点的近似、联合优化自编码器重构与自表达目标、直接在因子化表示上进行谱聚类

Result: 在保持与最先进方法相当聚类质量的同时，显著提升计算效率

Conclusion: SDSNet 有效解决了子空间聚类的可扩展性瓶颈，为大规模数据聚类提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Subspace clustering methods face inherent scalability limits due to the $O(n^3)$ cost (with $n$ denoting the number of data samples) of constructing full $n\times n$ affinities and performing spectral decomposition. While deep learning-based approaches improve feature extraction, they maintain this computational bottleneck through exhaustive pairwise similarity computations. We propose SDSNet (Scalable Deep Subspace Network), a deep subspace clustering framework that achieves $\mathcal{O}(n)$ complexity through (1) landmark-based approximation, avoiding full affinity matrices, (2) joint optimization of auto-encoder reconstruction with self-expression objectives, and (3) direct spectral clustering on factorized representations. The framework combines convolutional auto-encoders with subspace-preserving constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSNet achieves comparable clustering quality to state-of-the-art methods with significantly improved computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GPR图像解释依赖人工经验，效率低且易出错，亟需自动化方法。

Method: 采用DCGAN生成高保真GPR图像，构建MCGA-Net网络，融合多模态链特征融合与全局注意力机制，并利用MS COCO迁移学习优化骨干网络。

Result: MCGA-Net达到Precision 92.8%、Recall 92.5%、mAP@50 95.9%，在噪声、弱信号和小目标检测中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂地下环境中的GPR缺陷检测建立了高效高精度的新范式。

Abstract: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has emerged as a pivotal tool for non-destructive evaluation of subsurface road defects. However, conventional GPR image interpretation remains heavily reliant on subjective expertise, introducing inefficiencies and inaccuracies. This study introduces a comprehensive framework to address these limitations: (1) A DCGAN-based data augmentation strategy synthesizes high-fidelity GPR images to mitigate data scarcity while preserving defect morphology under complex backgrounds; (2) A novel Multi-modal Chain and Global Attention Network (MCGA-Net) is proposed, integrating Multi-modal Chain Feature Fusion (MCFF) for hierarchical multi-scale defect representation and Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) for context-aware feature enhancement; (3) MS COCO transfer learning fine-tunes the backbone network, accelerating convergence and improving generalization. Ablation and comparison experiments validate the framework's efficacy. MCGA-Net achieves Precision (92.8%), Recall (92.5%), and mAP@50 (95.9%). In the detection of Gaussian noise, weak signals and small targets, MCGA-Net maintains robustness and outperforms other models. This work establishes a new paradigm for automated GPR-based defect detection, balancing computational efficiency with high accuracy in complex subsurface environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CCAD方法，通过压缩全局特征作为重建条件，提升异常检测的效率与性能，超越现有方法并发布改进的DAGM数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督表示方法在域偏移下特征提取薄弱，重建方法训练效率低且因约束不足导致性能下降。

Method: 提出CCAD，利用压缩后的全局特征作为重建模型的条件输入，并设计自适应压缩机制以提升泛化与训练效率。

Result: CCAD在AUC指标上持续超越SOTA方法，收敛速度更快，并基于重标注的DAGM 2007数据集验证有效性。

Conclusion: CCAD成功融合重建与表示学习优势，通过条件建模与压缩机制实现高效高精度异常检测，代码开源。

Abstract: Anomaly detection holds considerable industrial significance, especially in scenarios with limited anomalous data. Currently, reconstruction-based and unsupervised representation-based approaches are the primary focus. However, unsupervised representation-based methods struggle to extract robust features under domain shift, whereas reconstruction-based methods often suffer from low training efficiency and performance degradation due to insufficient constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method named Compressed Global Feature Conditioned Anomaly Detection (CCAD). CCAD synergizes the strengths of both paradigms by adapting global features as a new modality condition for the reconstruction model. Furthermore, we design an adaptive compression mechanism to enhance both generalization and training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CCAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC while achieving faster convergence. In addition, we contribute a reorganized and re-annotated version of the DAGM 2007 dataset with new annotations to further validate our method's effectiveness. The code for reproducing main results is available at https://github.com/chloeqxq/CCAD.

TL;DR: 发布了一个大规模公开的多标注者皮肤病变分割数据集ISIC MultiAnnot++，包含17K分割掩码和标注者元数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤病变分割数据集缺乏多标注者数据和标注者元信息，限制了标注者偏好与质量分析研究。

Method: 基于ISIC档案构建ISIC MultiAnnot++数据集，收集14,967张皮肤镜图像的17,684个分割掩码，其中2,394张图像包含2-5个标注，并记录标注者技能水平与工具信息。

Result: 建成目前最大公开的多标注者皮肤病变分割数据集，提供分区数据、共识掩码及标注元数据。

Conclusion: 该数据集支持标注者偏好建模与质量分析，推动多标注者医学图像分割研究。

Abstract: Multi-annotator medical image segmentation is an important research problem, but requires annotated datasets that are expensive to collect. Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators' skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出门控渐进融合网络，通过多层级特征交互提升结肠息肉重识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶特征分辨率不足影响小目标息肉的重识别效果

Method: 提出门控渐进融合网络，采用门控机制实现多层级特征的全连接融合与层间细化

Result: 在标准基准上优于现有单模态模型，多模态融合策略效果显著

Conclusion: 多层级特征渐进融合能有效提升小目标息肉重识别精度

Abstract: Colonoscopic Polyp Re-Identification aims to match the same polyp from a large gallery with images from different views taken using different cameras, which plays an important role in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer in computer-aided diagnosis. However, the coarse resolution of high-level features of a specific polyp often leads to inferior results for small objects where detailed information is important. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture, named Gated Progressive Fusion network, to selectively fuse features from multiple levels using gates in a fully connected way for polyp ReID. On the basis of it, a gated progressive fusion strategy is introduced to achieve layer-wise refinement of semantic information through multi-level feature interactions. Experiments on standard benchmarks show the benefits of the multimodal setting over state-of-the-art unimodal ReID models, especially when combined with the specialized multimodal fusion strategy.

### [8] [Generative Multi-Focus Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21495)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种名为GMFF的生成式多焦点图像融合框架，通过确定性融合与生成式恢复两阶段联合优化，有效解决焦点缺失与边缘伪影问题，实现当前最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设每个空间位置至少有一个输入图像聚焦，且易受焦点估计不确定性和硬选择操作影响，导致边缘伪影，难以处理复杂真实场景。

Method: GMFF包含两阶段：第一阶段使用StackMFF V4进行确定性融合，利用焦平面信息生成初始图像；第二阶段通过IFControlNet基于潜在扩散模型进行生成式修复，恢复缺失内容并消除边缘伪影。

Result: GMFF在多焦点融合任务中达到最优性能，能有效处理复杂多焦场景，恢复细节并减少伪影，代码已开源。

Conclusion: GMFF通过分阶段设计实现了高质量融合，具备良好实用潜力，为多焦点图像处理提供了新范式。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion aims to generate an all-in-focus image from a sequence of partially focused input images. Existing fusion algorithms generally assume that, for every spatial location in the scene, there is at least one input image in which that location is in focus. Furthermore, current fusion models often suffer from edge artifacts caused by uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a generative multi-focus image fusion framework, termed GMFF, which operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, deterministic fusion is implemented using StackMFF V4, the latest version of the StackMFF series, and integrates the available focal plane information to produce an initial fused image. The second stage, generative restoration, is realized through IFControlNet, which leverages the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to reconstruct content from missing focal planes, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts. Each stage is independently developed and functions seamlessly in a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMFF achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance and exhibits significant potential for practical applications, particularly in scenarios involving complex multi-focal content. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Xinzhe99/StackMFF-Series.

### [9] [SVBench: Evaluation of Video Generation Models on Social Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21507)
*Wenshuo Peng,Gongxuan Wang,Tianmeng Yang,Chuanhao Li,Xiaojie Xu,Hui He,Kaipeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个视频生成的社会推理基准，揭示当前模型在意图、信念、共同注意等社会认知维度上存在严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型虽在视觉真实性和运动连贯性上进步显著，但缺乏对社会心理逻辑的理解，无法生成具有社会相干性的行为。

Method: 构建基于发展与社会心理学的30个经典范式七维基准，采用无训练的智能体管道生成场景，并通过高容量VLM评估器进行五维社会推理评分。

Result: 七种先进视频模型在表面合理性上表现良好，但在意图识别、信念推理、共同注意和亲社会推断等方面系统性失败。

Conclusion: 当前视频生成模型尚未具备基本社会认知能力，未来需融入心理与社会推理机制以实现真正的人类级视频生成。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video generation models exhibit remarkable progress in visual realism, motion fidelity, and text-video alignment, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their ability to generate socially coherent behavior. Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.

### [10] [Fixed-Budget Parameter-Efficient Training with Frozen Encoders Improves Multimodal Chest X-Ray Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21508)
*Md Ashik Khan,Md Nahid Siddique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 参数高效训练（PET）方法在胸片多模态分析中以极低参数量超越全微调，性能优异但校准需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全量微调大视觉-语言模型计算成本高，需探索参数高效策略以降低资源消耗并保持性能。

Method: 在Indiana University Chest X-Ray数据集上比较冻结编码器、BitFit、LoRA和适配器等PET方法，采用去病理词文本输入，并在CheXpert上验证可扩展性。

Result: 所有PET方法在2.37M参数下AUROC达0.892–0.908，优于全微调（0.770，94.3M参数）；CheXpert上适配器最佳（0.7214 AUROC）；视觉模型优于多模态模型，表明性能提升源于参数分配而非跨模态协同。

Conclusion: 冻结编码器的PET策略大幅降低计算成本并提升判别性能，但需通过后校准解决校准不佳问题以支持临床部署。

Abstract: Multimodal chest X-Ray analysis often fine-tunes large vision-language models, which is computationally costly. We study parameter-efficient training (PET) strategies, including frozen encoders, BitFit, LoRA, and adapters for multi-label classification on the Indiana University Chest X-Ray dataset (3,851 image-report pairs; 579 test samples). To mitigate data leakage, we redact pathology terms from reports used as text inputs while retaining clinical context. Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction. External validation on CheXpert (224,316 images, 58x larger) confirms scalability: all PET methods achieve >0.69 AUROC with <9% trainable parameters, with Adapter achieving best performance (0.7214 AUROC). Budget-matched comparisons reveal that vision-only models (0.653 AUROC, 1.06M parameters) outperform budget-matched multimodal models (0.641 AUROC, 1.06M parameters), indicating improvements arise primarily from parameter allocation rather than cross-modal synergy. While PET methods show degraded calibration (ECE: 0.29-0.34) compared to simpler models (ECE: 0.049), this represents a tractable limitation addressable through post-hoc calibration methods. These findings demonstrate that frozen encoder strategies provide superior discrimination at substantially reduced computational cost, though calibration correction is essential for clinical deployment.

### [11] [Fixed-Threshold Evaluation of a Hybrid CNN-ViT for AI-Generated Image Detection Across Photos and Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21512)
*Md Ashik Khan,Arafat Alam Jion*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出固定阈值评估协议，揭示AI生成图像检测中传统方法高估鲁棒性的问题，证明ViT比CNN更耐压缩，混合模型在艺术与写实图像上表现均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法在不同后处理变换下因反复调优阈值而高估鲁棒性，缺乏真实部署场景下的评估标准。

Method: 采用轻量级CNN-ViT混合架构（带门控融合与频域增强），在三个操作点（Low-FPR、ROC-optimal、Best-F1）下进行固定阈值评估，系统测试多种退化条件。

Result: CNN在原始图像上表现优异（93.33%），但压缩后大幅下降（61.49%）；ViT鲁棒性更强（92.86%→88.36%）；所有模型在艺术图像上AUROC比写实图像高15%；混合模型在多数据集上表现均衡。

Conclusion: 固定阈值评估揭示真实鲁棒性差距，建议：CNN用于干净照片验证，ViT用于压缩内容，混合模型用于艺术/图形筛查。

Abstract: AI image generators create both photorealistic images and stylized art, necessitating robust detectors that maintain performance under common post-processing transformations (JPEG compression, blur, downscaling). Existing methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors such as operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness. This work addresses misleading robustness estimates by introducing a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds, selected once on clean validation data, fixed across all post-processing transformations. Traditional methods retune thresholds per condition, artificially inflating robustness estimates and masking deployment failures. We report deployment-relevant performance at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Our evaluation exposes a statistically validated forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos but collapse under compression (93.33% to 61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%) through robust semantic pattern recognition. Multi-seed experiments demonstrate that all architectures achieve 15% higher AUROC on artistic content (0.901-0.907) versus photorealistic images (0.747-0.759), confirming that semantic patterns provide fundamentally more reliable detection cues than forensic artifacts. Our hybrid approach achieves balanced cross-domain performance: 91.4% accuracy on tiny-genimage photos, 89.7% on AiArtData art/graphics, and 98.3% (competitive) on CIFAKE. Fixed-threshold evaluation eliminates retuning inflation, reveals genuine robustness gaps, and yields actionable deployment guidance: prefer CNNs for clean photo verification, ViTs for compressed content, and hybrids for art/graphics screening.

Motivation: 现有极化水下3D重建数据集缺乏散射与观测条件的多样性，阻碍算法公平比较。

Method: 构建包含42个物体、7种散射条件和5个视角的MuS-Polar3D数据集，结合高精度3D模型与多任务标注；提出“去散射→3D重建”双阶段成像链路。

Result: 在复杂散射条件下实现最佳平均角误差15.49度，验证了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: MuS-Polar3D是首个公开的定量水下极化3D成像基准，推动算法公平评估与准确重建。

Abstract: Polarization-based underwater 3D imaging exploits polarization cues to suppress background scattering, exhibiting distinct advantages in turbid water. Although data-driven polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods show great potential, existing public datasets lack sufficient diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different approaches, including single-view and multi-view polarization imaging methods.
  To address this limitation, we construct MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset comprising polarization images of 42 objects captured under seven quantitatively controlled scattering conditions and five viewpoints, together with high-precision 3D models (+/- 0.05 mm accuracy), normal maps, and foreground masks. The dataset supports multiple vision tasks, including normal estimation, object segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.
  Inspired by computational imaging, we further decouple underwater 3D reconstruction under scattering into a two-stage pipeline, namely descattering followed by 3D reconstruction, from an imaging-chain perspective. Extensive evaluations using multiple baseline methods under complex scattering conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark, achieving a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees. To the best of our knowledge, MuS-Polar3D is the first publicly available benchmark dataset for quantitative turbidity underwater polarization-based 3D imaging, enabling accurate reconstruction and fair algorithm evaluation under controllable scattering conditions. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/WangPuyun/MuS-Polar3D.

TL;DR: 提出分布创造力奖励与结构感知正则化，提升GRPO图像生成的多样性和质量平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GRPO在训练后期导致输出同质化，因奖励信号仅依赖单样本质量且正则化忽视早期去噪对多样性的关键作用

Method: 1. 基于语义分组的分布创造力奖励：通过谱聚类构建生成样本的分布表示，按组大小自适应分配探索性奖励；2. 结构感知正则化：强化早期去噪阶段的约束以保留多样性

Result: 在保持质量不变的前提下，语义多样性提升13%–18%，建立GRPO图像生成的新帕累托前沿

Conclusion: 通过协同优化奖励建模与生成动力学，有效缓解GRPO的多样性退化问题，显著提升生成图像的创意与多样性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly GRPO, improves image generation quality significantly by comparing the relative performance of images generated within the same group. However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 13\%--18\% improvement in semantic diversity under matched quality scores, establishing a new Pareto frontier between image quality and diversity for GRPO-based image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种高效、参数少的层次感知微调框架，提升视觉语言模型在层级分类中的预测一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将标签视为平展类别，需全量微调且跨层级预测不一致，成本高

Method: 结合TP-KL（沿真实路径对齐预测）和HiSCE（同级类预测平滑）两类损失，配合轻量级LoRA微调，在共享嵌入空间中优化

Result: 在多个基准上显著提升全路径准确率，降低层级不一致误差，参数开销极小

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉语言模型高效适配结构化分类体系提供了可行方案

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) learn powerful multimodal representations through large-scale image-text pretraining, but adapting them to hierarchical classification is underexplored. Standard approaches treat labels as flat categories and require full fine-tuning, which is expensive and produces inconsistent predictions across taxonomy levels. We propose an efficient hierarchy-aware fine-tuning framework that updates a few parameters while enforcing structural consistency. We combine two objectives: Tree-Path KL Divergence (TP-KL) aligns predictions along the ground-truth label path for vertical coherence, while Hierarchy-Sibling Smoothed Cross-Entropy (HiSCE) encourages consistent predictions among sibling classes. Both losses work in the VLM's shared embedding space and integrate with lightweight LoRA adaptation. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show consistent improvements in Full-Path Accuracy and Tree-based Inconsistency Error with minimal parameter overhead. Our approach provides an efficient strategy for adapting VLMs to structured taxonomies.

Conclusion: 循环注意力是视觉Transformer中自注意力的有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the advancement of vision Transformers. However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.

TL;DR: EraseLoRA是一种无需数据集的对象移除方法，通过背景感知推理和测试时适应，优于现有自注意力干预方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无数据集方法在对象移除中易误将非目标前景视为背景，导致 unwanted 物体再生，并破坏细节与背景一致性。

Method: 提出EraseLoRA，包含背景感知前景排除（BFE）和背景感知重建与子类型聚合（BRSA），利用多模态大语言模型分离前景与背景，并通过测试时优化集成背景子类型。

Result: EraseLoRA作为预训练扩散模型的插件，在对象移除基准上持续优于无数据集基线，并接近有数据集方法的性能。

Conclusion: EraseLoRA通过避免直接注意力操作，实现更精准的背景重建，为无数据集对象移除提供了新范式。

Abstract: Object removal differs from common inpainting, since it must prevent the masked target from reappearing and reconstruct the occluded background with structural and contextual fidelity, rather than merely filling a hole plausibly. Recent dataset-free approaches that redirect self-attention inside the mask fail in two ways: non-target foregrounds are often misinterpreted as background, which regenerates unwanted objects, and direct attention manipulation disrupts fine details and hinders coherent integration of background cues. We propose EraseLoRA, a novel dataset-free framework that replaces attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation. First, Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE), uses a multimodal large-language models to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from a single image-mask pair without paired supervision, producing reliable background cues while excluding distractors. Second, Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA), performs test-time optimization that treats inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces and enforces their consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives, preserving local detail and global structure without explicit attention intervention. We validate EraseLoRA as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models and across benchmarks for object removal, demonstrating consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods. The code will be made available upon publication.

Abstract: Intelligent image editing increasingly relies on advances in computer vision, multimodal reasoning, and generative modeling. While vision-language models (VLMs) and diffusion models enable guided visual manipulation, existing work rarely ensures that inserted objects are \emph{contextually appropriate}. We introduce two new tasks for advertising and digital media: (1) \emph{context-aware object insertion}, which requires predicting suitable object categories, generating them, and placing them plausibly within the scene; and (2) \emph{sponsor-product logo augmentation}, which involves detecting products and inserting correct brand logos, even when items are unbranded or incorrectly branded. To support these tasks, we build two new datasets with category annotations, placement regions, and sponsor-product labels.

Conclusion: 呼吁研究人员更全面地披露实验细节，并验证方法的泛化能力以提升AIGC检测的可靠性。

Abstract: While the technology for detecting AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images has advanced rapidly, the field still faces two core issues: poor reproducibility and insufficient gen eralizability, which hinder the practical application of such technologies. This study addresses these challenges by re viewing 7 key papers on AIGC detection, constructing a lightweight test dataset, and reproducing a representative detection method. Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers. However, de tection performance drops sharply when preprocessing dis rupts key features or when testing across different genera tors. This research provides empirical evidence for improv ing the reproducibility of AIGC detection technologies and offers reference directions for researchers to disclose ex perimental details more comprehensively and verify the generalizability of their proposed methods.

Motivation: 现有小型视觉语言模型在有限窗口下无法有效对齐语言与图像信息，长上下文理解能力不足。

Method: 提出LAid方法，包含两个组件：渐进式距离加权注意力匹配和可学习的RoPE响应增益调制，以转移大模型的长程注意力机制。

Result: LAid蒸馏模型将有效上下文窗口扩展至基线小模型的3.2倍，同时保持或提升标准VL基准性能，并成功保留关键低频注意力成分。

Conclusion: LAid不仅为高效构建长上下文VLM提供实用方法，还揭示了位置理解在蒸馏过程中如何产生与迁移的理论洞察。

Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong long-context understanding, their prevalent small branches fail on linguistics-photography alignment for a limited window size. We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer. Our work not only provides practical techniques for building more efficient long-context VLMs but also offers theoretical insights into how positional understanding emerges and transfers during distillation.

Method: 构建图像-描述与描述-描述相似性学习机制，并利用33万条人工标注数据训练监督指标。

Result: 在Composite、Flickr8K等五大基准上超越现有非LLM指标，表现最优。

Conclusion: Pearl为图像描述评估提供了一种高效、中立且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We focus on the automatic evaluation of image captions in both reference-based and reference-free settings. Existing metrics based on large language models (LLMs) favor their own generations; therefore, the neutrality is in question. Most LLM-free metrics do not suffer from such an issue, whereas they do not always demonstrate high performance. To address these issues, we propose Pearl, an LLM-free supervised metric for image captioning, which is applicable to both reference-based and reference-free settings. We introduce a novel mechanism that learns the representations of image--caption and caption--caption similarities. Furthermore, we construct a human-annotated dataset for image captioning metrics, that comprises approximately 333k human judgments collected from 2,360 annotators across over 75k images. Pearl outperformed other existing LLM-free metrics on the Composite, Flickr8K-Expert, Flickr8K-CF, Nebula, and FOIL datasets in both reference-based and reference-free settings.

Conclusion: UltraLBM-UNet具备高精度、低计算开销特性，非常适合点诊场景的实时皮肤病变分析。

Abstract: Skin lesion segmentation is a crucial step in dermatology for guiding clinical decision-making. However, existing methods for accurate, robust, and resource-efficient lesion analysis have limitations, including low performance and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose UltraLBM-UNet, a lightweight U-Net variant that integrates a bidirectional Mamba-based global modeling mechanism with multi-branch local feature perception. The proposed architecture integrates efficient local feature injection with bidirectional state-space modeling, enabling richer contextual interaction across spatial dimensions while maintaining computational compactness suitable for point-of-care deployment. Extensive experiments on the ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, outperforming existing lightweight and Mamba counterparts with only 0.034M parameters and 0.060 GFLOPs. In addition, we introduce a hybrid knowledge distillation strategy to train an ultra-compact student model, where the distilled variant UltraLBM-UNet-T, with only 0.011M parameters and 0.019 GFLOPs, achieves competitive segmentation performance. These results highlight the suitability of UltraLBM-UNet for point-of-care deployment, where accurate and robust lesion analyses are essential.

Conclusion: 无标签框架为动态环境中有害内容检测提供了可扩展且有前景的解决方案

Abstract: The proliferation of harmful memes on online media poses significant risks to public health and stability. Existing detection methods heavily rely on large-scale labeled data for training, which necessitates substantial manual annotation efforts and limits their adaptability to the continually evolving nature of harmful content. To address these challenges, we present ALARM, the first lAbeL-free hARmful Meme detection framework powered by Large Multimodal Model (LMM) agent self-improvement. The core innovation of ALARM lies in exploiting the expressive information from "shallow" memes to iteratively enhance its ability to tackle more complex and subtle ones. ALARM consists of a novel Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification mechanism that isolates the explicit memes from the original dataset and assigns them pseudo-labels. Besides, a new Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement paradigm is introduced, where the explicit memes are reorganized into contrastive pairs (positive vs. negative) to refine a learner LMM agent. This agent autonomously derives high-level detection cues from these pairs, which in turn empower the agent itself to handle complex and challenging memes effectively. Experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate the superior performance and strong adaptability of ALARM to newly evolved memes. Notably, our method even outperforms label-driven methods. These results highlight the potential of label-free frameworks as a scalable and promising solution for adapting to novel forms and topics of harmful memes in dynamic online environments.

Abstract: Understanding protein flexibility and its dynamic interactions with other molecules is essential for protein function study. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) provides an opportunity to directly observe macromolecular dynamics. However, analyzing datasets that contain both continuous motions and discrete states remains highly challenging. Here we present GaussianEM, a Gaussian pseudo-atomic framework that simultaneously models compositional and conformational heterogeneity from experimental cryo-EM images. GaussianEM employs a two-encoder-one-decoder architecture to map an image to its individual Gaussian components, and represent structural variability through changes in Gaussian parameters. This approach provides an intuitive and interpretable description of conformational changes, preserves local structural consistency along the transition trajectories, and naturally bridges the gap between density-based models and corresponding atomic models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GaussianEM on both simulated and experimental datasets.

Abstract: High-fidelity and controllable 3D simulation is essential for addressing the long-tail data scarcity in Autonomous Driving (AD), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. Current approaches often falter in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.

Result: TAME在LCMP上表现最优，能有效捕捉个性化概念的演变，在长对话中持续提升交互体验。

Conclusion: 长上下文个性化是MLLM实用化的关键方向，LCMP与TAME为未来研究提供了新基准与有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) Personalization is a critical research problem that facilitates personalized dialogues with MLLMs targeting specific entities (known as personalized concepts). However, existing methods and benchmarks focus on the simple, context-agnostic visual identification and textual replacement of the personalized concept (e.g., "A yellow puppy" -> "Your puppy Mochi"), overlooking the ability to support long-context conversations. An ideal personalized MLLM assistant is capable of engaging in long-context dialogues with humans and continually improving its experience quality by learning from past dialogue histories. To bridge this gap, we propose LCMP, the first Long-Context MLLM Personalization evaluation benchmark. LCMP assesses the capability of MLLMs in perceiving variations of personalized concepts and generating contextually appropriate personalized responses that reflect these variations. As a strong baseline for LCMP, we introduce a novel training-free and state-aware framework TAME. TAME endows MLLMs with double memories to manage the temporal and persistent variations of each personalized concept in a differentiated manner. In addition, TAME incorporates a new training-free Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm. RA2G introduces an alignment step to extract the contextually fitted information from the multi-memory retrieved knowledge to the current questions, enabling better interactions for complex real-world user queries. Experiments on LCMP demonstrate that TAME achieves the best performance, showcasing remarkable and evolving interaction experiences in long-context scenarios.

Conclusion: 因果干预能有效消除虚假相关，提升少样本细粒度分类的泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual categorization (FS-FGVC) focuses on identifying various subcategories within a common superclass given just one or few support examples. Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ICST-MIPL/CausalFSFG_TMM.

Result: L1稀疏约束显著减少非目标属性扰动，更好保留面部身份，编辑更聚焦。

Conclusion: 稀疏潜空间操作是缓解属性纠缠的有效策略，提升文本驱动图像编辑的可控性。

Abstract: Text-driven image manipulation often suffers from attribute entanglement, where modifying a target attribute (e.g., adding bangs) unintentionally alters other semantic properties such as identity or appearance. The Predict, Prevent, and Evaluate (PPE) framework addresses this issue by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models for disentangled editing. In this work, we analyze the PPE framework, focusing on its architectural components, including BERT-based attribute prediction and StyleGAN2-based image generation on the CelebA-HQ dataset. Through empirical analysis, we identify a limitation in the original regularization strategy, where latent updates remain dense and prone to semantic leakage. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a sparsity-based constraint using L1 regularization on latent space manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach enforces more focused and controlled edits, effectively reducing unintended changes in non-target attributes while preserving facial identity.

Conclusion: Temporal multimodal grounding需结合语言与动态信息，TrackTeller为该任务提供了高效、统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.

Moreover, we construct a Chain-of-Thought dataset for causal reasoning in weather generation, enabling interpretable outputs and improved perceptual quality. Extensive experiments show Omni-Weather achieves state-of-the-art performance in both weather generation and understanding. Our findings further indicate that generative and understanding tasks in the weather domain can mutually enhance each other. Omni-Weather also demonstrates the feasibility and value of unifying weather generation and understanding.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models have achieved high accuracy in identifying synthetic media, but their decision processes remain largely opaque. In this paper we present a mechanistic interpretability framework for deepfake detection applied to a vision-language model. Our approach combines a sparse autoencoder (SAE) analysis of internal network representations with a novel forensic manifold analysis that probes how the model's features respond to controlled forensic artifact manipulations. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold, including intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity, vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts. These insights provide a first step toward opening the "black box" of deepfake detectors, allowing us to identify which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and to guide the development of more interpretable and robust models.

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要高效可靠的感知系统，需比较新型DL模型的性能以指导实际应用。

Method: 使用自建数据集，对比YOLO-NAS和YOLOv8s在目标检测任务中的表现。

Result: YOLOv8s训练时间节省75%，检测准确率83%高于YOLO-NAS的81%。

Conclusion: YOLOv8s在效率与精度平衡上更优，推荐用于自动驾驶感知系统。

Abstract: Recently, a plethora of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to achieve the efficiency, safety, and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). The AVs use a perception system to detect, localize, and identify other vehicles, pedestrians, and road signs to perform safe navigation and decision-making. In this paper, we compare the performance of DL models, including YOLO-NAS and YOLOv8, for a detection-based perception task. We capture a custom dataset and experiment with both DL models using our custom dataset. Our analysis reveals that the YOLOv8s model saves 75% of training time compared to the YOLO-NAS model. In addition, the YOLOv8s model (83%) outperforms the YOLO-NAS model (81%) when the target is to achieve the highest object detection accuracy. These comparative analyses of these new emerging DL models will allow the relevant research community to understand the models' performance under real-world use case scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual understanding tasks such as visual grounding, segmentation, and captioning. However, their ability to perceive perceptual-level image features remains limited. In this work, we present UniPercept-Bench, a unified framework for perceptual-level image understanding across three key domains: Aesthetics, Quality, Structure and Texture. We establish a hierarchical definition system and construct large-scale datasets to evaluate perceptual-level image understanding. Based on this foundation, we develop a strong baseline UniPercept trained via Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training and Task-Aligned RL, enabling robust generalization across both Visual Rating (VR) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks. UniPercept outperforms existing MLLMs on perceptual-level image understanding and can serve as a plug-and-play reward model for text-to-image generation. This work defines Perceptual-Level Image Understanding in the era of MLLMs and, through the introduction of a comprehensive benchmark together with a strong baseline, provides a solid foundation for advancing perceptual-level multimodal image understanding.

Result: 在多个跨域基准上达到SOTA性能，且源域分割精度显著保留。

Conclusion: 利用结构一致性作为可迁移先验，有效平衡跨域泛化与源域性能。

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot medical image segmentation (CD-FSMIS) offers a promising and data-efficient solution for medical applications where annotations are severely scarce and multimodal analysis is required. However, existing methods typically filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, which inadvertently limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. To address this, we present Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph), a framework that leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior. We represent image features as graphs, with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. A Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer is proposed to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling through explicit node interactions. Building upon SPG layers, we introduce a Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. Furthermore, we design a Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in the graph space. Our method significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.

Method: 构建SlideChain框架，基于1,117张医学讲座幻灯片提取概念与关系三元组，将加密哈希锚定至本地EVM区块链，实现防篡改审计与语义基线持久化。

Conclusion: SlideChain为AI辅助教育系统提供了实用、可扩展的可信语义溯源方案，支持长期审计、复现与完整性保障。

Abstract: Modern vision--language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to interpret and generate educational content, yet their semantic outputs remain challenging to verify, reproduce, and audit over time. Inconsistencies across model families, inference settings, and computing environments undermine the reliability of AI-generated instructional material, particularly in high-stakes and quantitative STEM domains. This work introduces SlideChain, a blockchain-backed provenance framework designed to provide verifiable integrity for multimodal semantic extraction at scale. Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide. SlideChain anchors cryptographic hashes of these records on a local EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)-compatible blockchain, providing tamper-evident auditability and persistent semantic baselines. Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs. Together, these results show that SlideChain provides a practical and scalable step toward trustworthy, verifiable multimodal educational pipelines, supporting long-term auditability, reproducibility, and integrity for AI-assisted instructional systems.

Result: 理论精确预测注意力热力图演化与实验结果，解释了令牌合并策略通过降低扩散系数延缓坍塌的机制。

Conclusion: 该分析为可扩展3D视觉Transformer提供理论框架，并暗示其在多模态泛化中的潜力。

Abstract: Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) delivers state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction, yet its global self-attention layer suffers from a drastic collapse phenomenon when the input sequence exceeds a few hundred frames: attention matrices rapidly become near rank-one, token geometry degenerates to an almost one-dimensional subspace, and reconstruction error accumulates super-linearly.In this report,we establish a rigorous mathematical explanation of the collapse by viewing the global-attention iteration as a degenerate diffusion process.We prove that,in VGGT, the token-feature flow converges toward a Dirac-type measure at a $O(1/L)$ rate, where $L$ is the layer index, yielding a closed-form mean-field partial differential equation that precisely predicts the empirically observed rank profile.The theory quantitatively matches the attention-heat-map evolution and a series of experiments outcomes reported in relevant works and explains why its token-merging remedy -- which periodically removes redundant tokens -- slows the effective diffusion coefficient and thereby delays collapse without additional training.We believe the analysis provides a principled lens for interpreting future scalable 3D-vision transformers,and we highlight its potential for multi-modal generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in digitization technologies have transformed the preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage. In this vein, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have emerged as a leading technology for 3D digitization, delivering representations with exceptional realism. However, existing methods struggle to accurately model anisotropic specular surfaces, typically observed, for example, on brushed metals. In this work, we introduce ShinyNeRF, a novel framework capable of handling both isotropic and anisotropic reflections. Our method is capable of jointly estimating surface normals, tangents, specular concentration, and anisotropy magnitudes of an Anisotropic Spherical Gaussian (ASG) distribution, by learning an approximation of the outgoing radiance as an encoded mixture of isotropic von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions. Experimental results show that ShinyNeRF not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on digitizing anisotropic specular reflections, but also offers plausible physical interpretations and editing of material properties compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of macular edema, a hallmark pathological feature in vision-threatening conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema, is essential for clinical diagnosis and management. To overcome the challenges of segmenting fluid regions in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images-notably ambiguous boundaries and cross-device heterogeneity-this study introduces Prior-AttUNet, a segmentation model augmented with generative anatomical priors. The framework adopts a hybrid dual-path architecture that integrates a generative prior pathway with a segmentation network. A variational autoencoder supplies multi-scale normative anatomical priors, while the segmentation backbone incorporates densely connected blocks and spatial pyramid pooling modules to capture richer contextual information. Additionally, a novel triple-attention mechanism, guided by anatomical priors, dynamically modulates feature importance across decoding stages, substantially enhancing boundary delineation. Evaluated on the public RETOUCH benchmark, Prior-AttUNet achieves excellent performance across three OCT imaging devices (Cirrus, Spectralis, and Topcon), with mean Dice similarity coefficients of 93.93%, 95.18%, and 93.47%, respectively. The model maintains a low computational cost of 0.37 TFLOPs, striking an effective balance between segmentation precision and inference efficiency. These results demonstrate its potential as a reliable tool for automated clinical analysis.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a well-established research area. In contrast, Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) is an emerging field with significant potential. This task is challenging due to the variation in individual handwriting styles. A large and diverse dataset is required to generate realistic handwritten text. However, such datasets are difficult to collect and are not readily available. Bengali is the fifth most spoken language in the world. While several studies exist for languages such as English and Arabic, Bengali handwritten text generation has received little attention. To address this gap, we propose a method for generating Bengali handwritten words. We developed and used a self-collected dataset of Bengali handwriting samples. The dataset includes contributions from approximately five hundred individuals across different ages and genders. All images were pre-processed to ensure consistency and quality. Our approach demonstrates the ability to produce diverse handwritten outputs from input plain text. We believe this work contributes to the advancement of Bengali handwriting generation and can support further research in this area.

Abstract: The fast evolution of generative models has heightened the demand for reliable detection of AI-generated images. To tackle this challenge, we introduce FUSE, a hybrid system that combines spectral features extracted through Fast Fourier Transform with semantic features obtained from the CLIP's Vision encoder. The features are fused into a joint representation and trained progressively in two stages. Evaluations on GenImage, WildFake, DiTFake, GPT-ImgEval and Chameleon datasets demonstrate strong generalization across multiple generators. Our FUSE (Stage 1) model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the Chameleon benchmark. It also attains 91.36% mean accuracy on the GenImage dataset, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, and a mean Average Precision of 94.96%. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators. Unlike existing methods, which often perform poorly on high-fidelity images in Chameleon, our approach maintains robustness across diverse generators. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating spectral and semantic features for generalized detection of images generated by AI.

Conclusion: ST-MoE通过灵活的专家设计和Mamba架构，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低计算成本，为多人运动预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Comprehensively and flexibly capturing the complex spatio-temporal dependencies of human motion is critical for multi-person motion prediction. Existing methods grapple with two primary limitations: i) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings for capturing spatiotemporal information. ii) High computational costs stemming from the quadratic time complexity of conventional attention mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE), which flexibly explores complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion and significantly reduces computational cost. To adaptively mine complex spatio-temporal patterns from human motion, our model incorporates four distinct types of spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in capturing different spatial or temporal dependencies. To reduce the potential computational overhead while integrating multiple experts, we introduce bidirectional spatiotemporal Mamba as experts, each sharing bidirectional temporal and spatial Mamba in distinct combinations to achieve model efficiency and parameter economy. Extensive experiments on four multi-person benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-art in accuracy but also reduces model parameter by 41.38% and achieves a 3.6x speedup in training.

Method: 提出RAPTOR架构，采用单次前向设计与高效视频注意力（EVA）模块，通过空间-时间轴分解将复杂度降至O(S+T)，结合三阶段训练策略，实现无补丁的稠密特征预测。

Result: 在Jetson AGX Orin上实现512^2分辨率>30 FPS，在UAVid、KTH等数据集上PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS均达SOTA，并提升无人机任务成功率18%。

Conclusion: RAPTOR打破了视频预测中分辨率、质量与速度的长期权衡，为边缘端实时感知型智能体提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Video prediction is plagued by a fundamental trilemma: achieving high-resolution and perceptual quality typically comes at the cost of real-time speed, hindering its use in latency-critical applications. This challenge is most acute for autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments, where foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery is non-negotiable for safety. Existing methods, reliant on iterative generation (diffusion, autoregressive models) or quadratic-complexity attention, fail to meet these stringent demands on edge hardware. To break this long-standing trade-off, we introduce RAPTOR, a video prediction architecture that achieves real-time, high-resolution performance. RAPTOR's single-pass design avoids the error accumulation and latency of iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a novel translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling. Instead of processing flattened spacetime tokens with $O((ST)^2)$ or $O(ST)$ complexity, EVA alternates operations along the spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes. This factorization reduces the time complexity to $O(S + T)$ and memory complexity to $O(max(S, T))$, enabling global context modeling at $512^2$ resolution and beyond, operating directly on dense feature maps with a patch-free design. Complementing this architecture is a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp, temporally coherent details. Experiments show RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for $512^2$ video, setting a new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and a custom high-resolution dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Critically, RAPTOR boosts the mission success rate in a real-world UAV navigation task by 18/%, paving the way for safer and more anticipatory embodied agents.

Abstract: Embodied navigation in open, dynamic environments demands accurate foresight of how the world will evolve and how actions will unfold over time. We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled "envision-then-plan" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution. Overall, by unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, we move closer to reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents that operate robustly in open-ended real-world settings.

Conclusion: Knot Forcing为实时交互式人像动画提供了高效、稳定的新方案

Abstract: Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.

Result: 在自然场景音唇同步任务中，视觉质量、时间连贯性和身份保持方面达到SOTA

Conclusion: 两阶段框架有效解决掩码训练的缺陷，实现高保真、稳定的音唇同步视频生成

Abstract: High-quality AI-powered video dubbing demands precise audio-lip synchronization, high-fidelity visual generation, and faithful preservation of identity and background. Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the wild lip-syncing scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal medical imaging provides complementary information that is crucial for accurate delineation of pathology, but the development of deep learning models is limited by the scarcity of large datasets in which different modalities are paired and spatially aligned. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns a single unified segmentation model from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts. The architecture exploits the parameter efficiency and expressive power of Quaternion Neural Networks to construct a shared feature space. At its core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data driven attention module that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between the two streams. By learning to modulate the flow of information dynamically, the A-QCF block allows the network to exchange abstract modality specific expertise, such as the sharp anatomical boundary information available in CT and the subtle soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This mutual exchange regularizes and enriches the feature representations of both streams. We validate the framework by jointly training a single model on the unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. The jointly trained model achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, significantly exceeding the strong unimodal nnU-Net baseline by margins of 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Furthermore, comprehensive explainability analysis using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ confirms that the model correctly focuses on relevant pathological structures, ensuring the learned representations are clinically meaningful. This provides a robust and clinically viable paradigm for unlocking the large unpaired imaging archives that are common in healthcare.

### [46] [BertsWin: Resolving Topological Sparsity in 3D Masked Autoencoders via Component-Balanced Structural Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21769)
*Evgeny Alves Limarenko,Anastasiia Studenikina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BertsWin是一种结合BERT式掩码与Swin Transformer窗口的3D医学影像自监督学习架构，显著加速语义收敛并减少训练迭代次数，且不增加计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D自监督方法（如MAE）在处理3D医学影像时难以捕捉三维空间关系，且75%的token被丢弃导致空间拓扑丢失。

Method: 提出BertsWin架构，采用全3D token网格（掩码+可见）结合Swin局部窗口，引入结构优先损失函数，并搭配GradientConductor优化器。

Result: 相比ViT-MAE，语义收敛加速5.8倍，训练epoch减少15倍（44 vs 660），重建精度达SOTA，且FLOPs与稀疏基线持平。

Conclusion: BertsWin通过保留完整3D空间拓扑，在不增加计算负担的前提下实现高效3D自监督预训练，为医学影像分析提供新范式。

Abstract: The application of self-supervised learning (SSL) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) approaches demonstrates promising results in the field of 2D medical imaging, but the use of these methods on 3D volumetric images is fraught with difficulties. Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.

Conclusion: 所提方法为长视频生成提供了高效、内存友好的新范式，为未来高帧率、长时间视频合成奠定基础。

Abstract: Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.

Conclusion: Scene-VLM实现了高性能、可解释的视频场景分割，开创了VLM在该任务中的新范式。

Abstract: Segmenting long-form videos into semantically coherent scenes is a fundamental task in large-scale video understanding. Existing encoder-based methods are limited by visual-centric biases, classify each shot in isolation without leveraging sequential dependencies, and lack both narrative understanding and explainability. In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard scene segmentation benchmarks. On MovieNet, for example, Scene-VLM yields significant improvements of +6 AP and +13.7 F1 over the previous leading method.

Motivation: 传统LoRA和MoLE在多条件任务中因局部路由导致任务干扰、空间碎片和语义漂移，难以保持用户指令的全局一致性。

Method: 提出InstructMoLE，采用指令引导路由（IGR）实现全局专家选择，并引入输出空间正交损失以增强专家多样性。

Conclusion: InstructMoLE为生成模型的指令驱动微调提供了鲁棒且可推广的框架，实现了更强的组合控制与意图保真度。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.

Method: 采用无条件扩散先验结合基于梯度的条件约束，实施似然引导采样，评估不同引导尺度与噪声水平下的PSNR、SSIM及综合评分。

Result: 中等引导强度（PS=0.95, σ=0.01）取得最佳评分1.45231，边缘更锐利、人脸细节更连贯，优于MCG和PS-annealed等其他策略。

Conclusion: 平衡扩散先验与测量梯度强度可在不重训模型的情况下实现稳定高质量重建，DPS为单图像超分辨率提供高效新范式。

Abstract: This report studies diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) for single-image super-resolution (SISR) under a known degradation model. We implement a likelihood-guided sampling procedure that combines an unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for $4\times$ super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $σ=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs. These findings highlight the importance of balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength to obtain stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining the diffusion model for each operator.

Abstract: Cell detection in pathological images presents unique challenges due to densely packed objects, subtle inter-class differences, and severe background clutter. In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our results validate CellMamba as an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution cell detection.

Abstract: This paper is about predicting the movement of stock consist of S&P 500 index. Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2].
  The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.

Motivation: 现有基于熵的攻击假设所有解码步骤同等重要，忽略了少数高熵决策点对输出轨迹的主导作用，导致攻击效率低且忽视真实安全风险。

Method: 提出Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial (EGA)攻击，仅在高熵关键token位置施加扰动，以最小预算实现语义破坏与有害输出转化。

Result: 在多个VLM上，EGA将35-49%的正常输出转为有害内容，攻击成功率高达93-95%，且具有跨模型迁移性（17-26%）。

Conclusion: 高熵决策点普遍存在且可迁移，揭示当前VLM安全机制存在根本性脆弱性，需针对性加固关键生成节点。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Multi-view cooperative perception and multimodal fusion are essential for reliable 3D spatiotemporal understanding in autonomous driving, especially under occlusions, limited viewpoints, and communication delays in V2X scenarios. This paper proposes XET-V2X, a multi-modal fused end-to-end tracking framework for v2x collaboration that unifies multi-view multimodal sensing within a shared spatiotemporal representation. To efficiently align heterogeneous viewpoints and modalities, XET-V2X introduces a dual-layer spatial cross-attention module based on multi-scale deformable attention. Multi-view image features are first aggregated to enhance semantic consistency, followed by point cloud fusion guided by the updated spatial queries, enabling effective cross-modal interaction while reducing computational overhead. Experiments on the real-world V2X-Seq-SPD dataset and the simulated V2X-Sim-V2V and V2X-Sim-V2I benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in detection and tracking performance under varying communication delays. Both quantitative results and qualitative visualizations indicate that XET-V2X achieves robust and temporally stable perception in complex traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: SCL-PNC通过结构化的可扩展骨干、自适应层与动态ETF分类器，实现了高效、一致的类增量学习，为真实场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Incremental learning often encounter challenges such as overfitting to new data and catastrophic forgetting of old data. Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

Conclusion: TPS-SCL有效解决未配准RGB-T图像的检测难题，兼顾性能与效率，推动实际应用落地。

Abstract: Existing RGB-T salient object detection methods predominantly rely on manually aligned and annotated datasets, struggling to handle real-world scenarios with raw, unaligned RGB-T image pairs. In practical applications, due to significant cross-modal disparities such as spatial misalignment, scale variations, and viewpoint shifts, the performance of current methods drastically deteriorates on unaligned datasets. To address this issue, we propose an efficient RGB-T SOD method for real-world unaligned image pairs, termed Thin-Plate Spline-driven Semantic Correlation Learning Network (TPS-SCL). We employ a dual-stream MobileViT as the encoder, combined with efficient Mamba scanning mechanisms, to effectively model correlations between the two modalities while maintaining low parameter counts and computational overhead. To suppress interference from redundant background information during alignment, we design a Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to hierarchically constrain salient features. Furthermore, we introduce a Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) to mitigate spatial discrepancies between modalities. Additionally, a Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) is incorporated to fully explore and integrate inter-modal dependencies, enhancing detection performance. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that TPS-SCL attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among existing lightweight SOD methods and outperforms mainstream RGB-T SOD approaches.

Conclusion: ADT-Tree有效解决视觉AR模型中推测解码的接受率不一致性问题，为高效生成高质量图像提供新路径。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image models achieve diffusion-level quality but suffer from sequential inference, requiring approximately 2,000 steps for a 576x576 image. Speculative decoding with draft trees accelerates LLMs yet underperforms on visual AR models due to spatially varying token prediction difficulty. We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively.

TL;DR: DIOR是一种无需训练的方法，利用视觉-语言模型生成基于文本条件的图像嵌入，在条件图像相似性任务中表现优于CLIP和其他基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型（如CLIP）虽提供丰富的图像表征，但无法聚焦于特定文本条件（如颜色、类型）指定的图像特征。

Method: DIOR通过提示大视觉语言模型用一个与条件相关的词描述图像，并提取其最后一个token的隐藏状态作为条件图像嵌入，无需额外训练。

Result: 在条件图像相似性任务中，DIOR超越了包括CLIP在内的所有无训练基线，并在多个设置下优于需训练的方法。

Conclusion: DIOR提供了一种通用、无需训练的解决方案，能有效生成条件感知的图像嵌入，具有广泛适用性和优越性能。

Abstract: Conditional image embeddings are feature representations that focus on specific aspects of an image indicated by a given textual condition (e.g., color, genre), which has been a challenging problem. Although recent vision foundation models, such as CLIP, offer rich representations of images, they are not designed to focus on a specified condition. In this paper, we propose DIOR, a method that leverages a large vision-language model (LVLM) to generate conditional image embeddings. DIOR is a training-free approach that prompts the LVLM to describe an image with a single word related to a given condition. The hidden state vector of the LVLM's last token is then extracted as the conditional image embedding. DIOR provides a versatile solution that can be applied to any image and condition without additional training or task-specific priors. Comprehensive experimental results on conditional image similarity tasks demonstrate that DIOR outperforms existing training-free baselines, including CLIP. Furthermore, DIOR achieves superior performance compared to methods that require additional training across multiple settings.

TL;DR: 特征级融合CNN模型在多源眼底图像上实现高效准确的糖尿病视网膜病变二分类筛查，Eff+Den融合模型在精度与速度间取得最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变筛查受限于专家资源不足和图像质量差异，亟需高效通用的自动化方法。

Method: 基于五个公开数据集（共11,156张图像），比较ResNet50、EfficientNet-B0、DenseNet121及其两两与三重特征融合模型，采用二分类任务评估性能。

Result: EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121融合模型取得最高平均准确率82.89%，正常与病变类F1分数分别为83.60%和82.60%；三重融合性能接近但计算成本高；EfficientNet-B0推理最快（1.16ms/图）。

Conclusion: 轻量级特征融合可提升模型在异构数据上的泛化能力，为大规模DR筛查提供精度与效率兼备的实用方案。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, yet large-scale screening is constrained by limited specialist availability and variable image quality across devices and populations. This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\%) and diabetic (82.60\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance. These findings indicate that lightweight feature fusion can enhance generalization across heterogeneous datasets, supporting scalable binary DR screening workflows where both accuracy and throughput are critical.

TL;DR: EasyOmnimatte提出一种高效的端到端视频omnimatte方法，通过双专家机制在不牺牲质量的前提下大幅提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖慢速、多阶段或推理时优化流程，未能充分利用生成先验，导致分解效果不佳。

Method: 基于预训练视频修复扩散模型，仅对特定DiT块应用LoRA构建Effect Expert捕捉前景结构与关联效应，全块LoRA微调构建Quality Expert细化alpha遮罩，采样时分阶段调用双专家。

Result: 在质量和效率上均超越基线方法，实现SOTA性能，并支持多种下游任务。

Conclusion: 双专家策略有效分离效应与细节学习，避免全块LoRA导致的效应信息抑制，实现高效高质的视频omnimatte分解。

Abstract: Existing video omnimatte methods typically rely on slow, multi-stage, or inference-time optimization pipelines that fail to fully exploit powerful generative priors, producing suboptimal decompositions. Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although naïvely finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy. Experiments demonstrate that EasyOmnimatte sets a new state-of-the-art for video omnimatte and enables various downstream tasks, significantly outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.

Motivation: 传统固定长度token化导致注意力计算复杂度随分辨率平方增长，效率低下

Method: 利用轻量级自回归模型的下一个token预测熵作为信息含量指标，动态合并token为可变数量的补丁

Conclusion: DPAR在保持架构兼容性的同时，实现高效、鲁棒的图像生成，为大规模视觉生成提供新范式

Abstract: Decoder-only autoregressive image generation typically relies on fixed-length tokenization schemes whose token counts grow quadratically with resolution, substantially increasing the computational and memory demands of attention. We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs. Further, our method exhibits faster convergence and improves FID by up to 27.1% relative to baseline models.

TL;DR: SLIM-Brain是一种新型无图谱fMRI基础模型，通过两阶段自适应设计显著提升数据和训练效率，在保持 voxel 级精度的同时大幅降低内存与计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有fMRI基础模型面临数据效率与训练效率的双重瓶颈：基于图谱的方法丢失细粒度空间信息，需大量数据；无图谱方法保留空间细节但计算开销过大，难以大规模预训练。

Method: SLIM-Brain采用两阶段设计：(1) 轻量级时间提取器捕捉全局上下文并按显著性排序数据窗口；(2) 4D分层编码器Hiera-JEPA仅对前k个高显著窗口学习voxel级表示，掩码删除约70%补丁。

Result: 在七个公开基准上达到SOTA性能，预训练仅需4000次会话，GPU内存使用减少约30%。

Conclusion: SLIM-Brain首次实现无图谱fMRI基础模型在数据与训练效率上的双重突破，为高效脑科学建模提供新范式。

Abstract: Foundation models are emerging as a powerful paradigm for fMRI analysis, but current approaches face a dual bottleneck of data- and training-efficiency. Atlas-based methods aggregate voxel signals into fixed regions of interest, reducing data dimensionality but discarding fine-grained spatial details, and requiring extremely large cohorts to train effectively as general-purpose foundation models. Atlas-free methods, on the other hand, operate directly on voxel-level information - preserving spatial fidelity but are prohibitively memory- and compute-intensive, making large-scale pre-training infeasible. We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches. Extensive experiments across seven public benchmarks show that SLIM-Brain establishes new state-of-the-art performance on diverse tasks, while requiring only 4 thousand pre-training sessions and approximately 30% of GPU memory comparing to traditional voxel-level methods.

Conclusion: 该框架突破了传统后期融合的局限，在结构化与非结构化环境中均实现鲁棒实时视觉定位，具备广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual localization has traditionally been formulated as a pair-wise pose regression problem. Existing approaches mainly estimate relative poses between two images and employ a late-fusion strategy to obtain absolute pose estimates. However, the late motion average is often insufficient for effectively integrating spatial information, and its accuracy degrades in complex environments. In this paper, we present the first visual localization framework that performs multi-view spatial integration through an early-fusion mechanism, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Our framework is built upon the VGGT backbone, which encodes multi-view 3D geometry, and we introduce a pose tokenizer and projection module to more effectively exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse mask attention strategy that reduces computational cost by avoiding the quadratic complexity of global attention, thereby enabling real-time performance at scale. Trained on approximately eight million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments. Our code and models will be publicly released upon acceptance.https://github.com/dtc111111/Reloc-VGGT.

Abstract: Digital crown design remains a labor-intensive bottleneck in restorative dentistry. We present \textbf{CrownGen}, a generative framework that automates patient-customized crown design using a denoising diffusion model on a novel tooth-level point cloud representation. The system employs two core components: a boundary prediction module to establish spatial priors and a diffusion-based generative module to synthesize high-fidelity morphology for multiple teeth in a single inference pass. We validated CrownGen through a quantitative benchmark on 496 external scans and a clinical study of 26 restoration cases. Results demonstrate that CrownGen surpasses state-of-the-art models in geometric fidelity and significantly reduces active design time. Clinical assessments by trained dentists confirmed that CrownGen-assisted crowns are statistically non-inferior in quality to those produced by expert technicians using manual workflows. By automating complex prosthetic modeling, CrownGen offers a scalable solution to lower costs, shorten turnaround times, and enhance patient access to high-quality dental care.

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了长视频生成与细粒度细节合成的挑战，推动了高质量人体动画的发展

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of human image animation. While existing methods can generate temporally consistent results for short or regular motions, significant challenges remain, particularly in generating long-duration videos. Furthermore, the synthesis of fine-grained facial and hand details remains under-explored, limiting the applicability of current approaches in real-world, high-quality applications. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based framework which focuses on generating high-fidelity and long-duration human animation videos. First, we design a set of hybrid implicit guidance signals and a sharpness guidance factor, enabling our framework to additionally incorporate detailed facial and hand features as guidance. Next, we incorporate the time-aware position shift fusion module, modify the input format within the DiT backbone, and refer to this mechanism as the Position Shift Adaptive Module, which enables video generation of arbitrary length. Finally, we introduce a novel data augmentation strategy and a skeleton alignment model to reduce the impact of human shape variations across different identities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance in both high-fidelity and long-duration human image animation.

Conclusion: PAN有效解决了模态异质性问题，实现了更语义一致的多模态融合，为后续研究提供了新范式

Abstract: While human action recognition has witnessed notable achievements, multimodal methods fusing RGB and skeleton modalities still suffer from their inherent heterogeneity and fail to fully exploit the complementary potential between them. In this paper, we propose PAN, the first human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition, in which token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. The human-centric graph modeling paradigm suppresses the redundancy in RGB frames and aligns well with skeleton-based methods, thus enabling a more effective and semantically coherent fusion of multimodal features. Since the sampling of token embeddings heavily relies on 2D skeletal data, we further propose attention-based post calibration to reduce the dependency on high-quality skeletal data at a minimal cost interms of model performance. To explore the potential of PAN in integrating with skeleton-based methods, we present two variants: PAN-Ensemble, which employs dual-path graph convolution networks followed by late fusion, and PAN-Unified, which performs unified graph representation learning within a single network. On three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets, both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective settings of multimodal fusion: separate and unified modeling, respectively.

Abstract: Product posters blend striking visuals with informative text to highlight the product and capture customer attention. However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users. Experiments demonstrate that AutoPP achieves state-of-the-art results in both offline and online settings. Our code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/JD-GenX/AutoPP

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升多中心多模态MRI病变检测的泛化性与精度，为无监督异常检测提供新思路

Abstract: Detection of various lesions in brain MRI is clinically critical, but challenging due to the diversity of lesions and variability in imaging conditions. Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges. Evaluated on nine public datasets (4,443 patients' MRIs from multiple centers), our method outperforms 17 SOTA methods, achieving absolute improvements of +18.32% in AP and +13.64% in DSC.

Result: 在EnlightenGAN基础上验证DRU有效性，显著提升感知与美学质量，优于SOTA方法。

Conclusion: DRU开创了数据中心的学习范式，有望推广至视觉与语言领域。

Abstract: By contrast with the prevailing works of low-light enhancement in natural images and videos, this study copes with the low-illumination quality degradation in anime scenery images to bridge the domain gap. For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective. We hope our framework can expose a novel paradigm of data-centric learning for potential visual and language domains. Code is available.

Conclusion: 参数级对抗编辑比传统解码校准更优，为VLM幻觉治理提供了可训练的新路径。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have garnered increasing attention in the AI community due to their promising practical applications, they exhibit persistent hallucination issues, generating outputs misaligned with visual inputs. Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \textbf{A}ctivate-\textbf{L}ocate-\textbf{E}dit \textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations.

Conclusion: 该方法能自动发现简单、可解释、光照不变的高精度光谱指数，适用于多传感器和分类任务，已开源实现。

Abstract: We introduce an automated way to find compact spectral indices for vegetation classification. The idea is to take all pairwise normalized differences from the spectral bands and then build polynomial combinations up to a fixed degree, which gives a structured search space that still keeps the illumination invariance needed in remote sensing. For a sensor with $n$ bands this produces $\binom{n}{2}$ base normalized differences, and the degree-2 polynomial expansion gives 1,080 candidate features for the 10-band Sentinel-2 configuration we use here. Feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, and $L_1$-regularized SVM) then pick out small sets of indices that reach the desired accuracy, so the final models stay simple and easy to interpret. We test the framework on Kochia (\textit{Bassia scoparia}) detection using Sentinel-2 imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada ($N = 2{,}318$ samples, 2022--2024). A single degree-2 index, the product of two normalized differences from the red-edge bands, already reaches 96.26\% accuracy, and using eight indices only raises this to 97.70\%. In every case the chosen features are degree-2 products built from bands $b_4$ through $b_8$, which suggests that the discriminative signal comes from spectral \emph{interactions} rather than individual band ratios. Because the indices involve only simple arithmetic, they can be deployed directly in platforms like Google Earth Engine. The same approach works for other sensors and classification tasks, and an open-source implementation (\texttt{ndindex}) is available.

Abstract: Medical Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising clinical performance. However, their sensitivity to real-world input perturbations, such as imaging artifacts and textual errors, critically undermines their clinical applicability. Systematic analysis of such noise impact on medical MLLMs remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, while several works have investigated the MLLMs' robustness in general domains, they primarily focus on text modality and rely on costly fine-tuning. They are inadequate to address the complex noise patterns and fulfill the strict safety standards in medicine. To bridge this gap, this work systematically analyzes the impact of various perturbations on medical MLLMs across both visual and textual modalities. Building on our findings, we introduce a training-free Inherent-enhanced Multi-modal Calibration (IMC) framework that leverages MLLMs' inherent denoising capabilities following the perceive-and-calibrate principle for cross-modal robustness enhancement. For the visual modality, we propose a Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) which leverages MLLMs' own vision encoder to identify noise patterns and perform prototype-guided feature calibration. For text denoising, we design a Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) that exploits the MLLMs' self-assessment capabilities to refine noisy text through a cooperative hierarchy of agents. We construct a benchmark containing 11 types of noise across both image and text modalities on 2 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple modalities, showing potential to enhance MLLMs' robustness in real clinical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级多尺度注意力框架LMSF-A，用于脊柱内镜实时实例分割，在低参数和低计算量下实现高精度，并发布临床数据集PELD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱内镜手术中实时实例分割面临视野狭窄、镜面高光、烟雾/出血、边界模糊和尺度变化大等挑战，且手术硬件资源有限，需在精度与速度间平衡并支持小批量（甚至单样本）训练。

Method: 提出LMSF-A框架，包含：1）C2f-Pro主干网络，融合RepViT重参数化卷积与高效多尺度注意力（EMA），支持多分支训练与单路径推理；2）SSFF与TFE颈部模块，增强跨尺度一致性与高分辨率边界细节；3）LMSH轻量多任务共享头，使用共享卷积与GroupNorm减少参数并提升batch-1稳定性。

Result: LMSF-A仅需1.8M参数和8.8 GFLOPs，在多个评估指标上优于或媲美现有方法，且在公开牙齿数据集上表现良好，具备强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LMSF-A为脊柱内镜手术提供了高效、轻量、稳定的实时实例分割解决方案，并通过发布临床数据集PELD推动了该领域研究。

Abstract: Real-time instance segmentation for spinal endoscopy is important for identifying and protecting critical anatomy during surgery, but it is difficult because of the narrow field of view, specular highlights, smoke/bleeding, unclear boundaries, and large scale changes. Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability. We also release the clinically reviewed PELD dataset (61 patients, 610 images) with instance masks for adipose tissue, bone, ligamentum flavum, and nerve. Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出LVLM-VA方法，利用大视觉语言模型对小视觉模型进行人类领域知识对齐，减少对虚假相关性的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模视觉模型虽高效可解释，但常依赖虚假相关性，导致实际部署中行为脆弱。

Method: 提出LVLM-VA方法，通过双向接口将模型行为转为自然语言，并将人类规范映射为图像级反馈，实现专家与模型交互。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上验证，显著提升模型与人类知识一致性，降低虚假特征与群体偏见依赖，无需细粒度反馈。

Conclusion: LVLM-VA是一种高效、无需细粒度标注的对齐方法，能有效增强小模型的可信赖性与泛化能力。

Abstract: In high-stakes domains, small task-specific vision models are crucial due to their low computational requirements and the availability of numerous methods to explain their results. However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We show that it effectively reduces the model's dependence on spurious features and on group-specific biases, without requiring fine-grained feedback.

TL;DR: iSHIFT是一种轻量级多模态代理，通过隐式慢快推理和感知控制模块，在保持2.5B小规模的同时，实现高效与高精度的GUI交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理难以兼顾高效执行常规任务与精确视觉定位，且大模型无法根据任务动态调整推理深度。

Method: iSHIFT引入隐式思维链与感知控制模块，利用特殊感知令牌引导注意力，动态切换慢模式（精细视觉定位）与快模式（全局线索推理）。

Result: 2.5B规模的iSHIFT在多个基准数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: iSHIFT通过灵活的推理模式切换和注意力引导，实现了小模型高精度GUI交互的突破。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show strong potential for interpreting and interacting with complex, pixel-rich Graphical User Interface (GUI) environments. However, building agents that are both efficient for high-level tasks and precise for fine-grained interactions remains challenging. GUI agents must perform routine actions efficiently while also handling tasks that demand exact visual grounding, yet existing approaches struggle when accuracy depends on identifying specific interface elements. These MLLMs also remain large and cannot adapt their reasoning depth to the task at hand. In this work, we introduce iSHIFT: Implicit Slow-fast Hybrid Inference with Flexible Tokens, a lightweight agent that integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. iSHIFT enables an MLLM to switch between a slow mode, which leverages detailed visual grounding for high precision and a fast mode that uses global cues for efficiency. Special perception tokens guide attention to relevant screen regions, allowing the model to decide both how to reason and where to focus. Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有无人机视觉语言导航方法难以建模复杂环境中的长时序时空上下文，导致语义对齐不准和路径规划不稳定。

Method: 设计历史感知的时空建模策略，包括插槽式历史图像压缩、时空轨迹编码和提示引导的多模态融合模块。

Result: 在可见与不可见环境中，成功率提升7.89%，路径加权成功率提升6.33%，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LongFly有效提升了无人机长时序导航的语义理解与路径预测能力，为灾难救援提供了更鲁棒的视觉语言导航方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are crucial tools for post-disaster search and rescue, facing challenges such as high information density, rapid changes in viewpoint, and dynamic structures, especially in long-horizon navigation. However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that LongFly outperforms state-of-the-art UAV VLN baselines by 7.89\% in success rate and 6.33\% in success weighted by path length, consistently across both seen and unseen environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法依赖手工特征和复杂架构，在面对未知伪造模式时性能显著下降

Method: 采用迁移学习结合深度伪造特定表征学习、特征空间重分布和分类不变特征增强策略，无额外可训练参数

Result: 在跨域和跨伪造方法设置中达到SOTA性能，仅需0.28M可训练参数

Conclusion: GenDF框架简单高效，显著提升泛化能力，为深度伪造检测提供新思路

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of highly realistic fake facial images, posing serious threats to personal privacy and the integrity of online information. Existing deepfake detection methods often rely on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures, achieving strong performance in intra-domain settings but suffering significant degradation when confronted with unseen forgery patterns. In this paper, we propose GenDF, a simple yet effective framework that transfers a powerful large-scale vision model to the deepfake detection task with a compact and neat network design. GenDF incorporates deepfake-specific representation learning to capture discriminative patterns between real and fake facial images, feature space redistribution to mitigate distribution mismatch, and a classification-invariant feature augmentation strategy to enhance generalization without introducing additional trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenDF achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings while requiring only 0.28M trainable parameters, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出首个针对提示驱动视频分割基础模型的后门攻击框架BadVSFM，突破传统攻击无效的瓶颈，实现高攻击成功率且不损害原始性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后门攻击（如BadNet）在视频分割基础模型上几乎无效（ASR<5%），因编码器梯度与注意力机制抑制了触发器学习，亟需针对性攻击方法。

Method: BadVSFM采用两阶段策略：第一阶段引导编码器使触发帧映射至目标嵌入，同时保持干净帧与参考编码器一致；第二阶段训练掩码解码器，使触发帧-提示对生成共享目标掩码，而干净输出保持参考解码器行为。

Result: 在两个数据集和五个VFSM上验证，BadVSFM实现高且可控的后门效果（ASR显著提升），在多种触发器与提示下保持清洁分割质量，现有防御方法基本失效。

Conclusion: BadVSFM揭示了提示驱动视频分割模型因梯度对齐与注意力机制导致的新颖后门漏洞，证明两阶段设计的必要性，为安全研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Prompt-driven Video Segmentation Foundation Models (VSFMs) such as SAM2 are increasingly deployed in applications like autonomous driving and digital pathology, raising concerns about backdoor threats. Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.

Result: 在 ScreenSpot-Pro、MMBench GUI L2、OSWorld-G、UI-Vision 等基准上超越 Gemini-3-Pro 和 Seed1.8；AndroidWorld 达 76.7% SOTA；MobileWorld 达 41.7%，接近 Gemini-3-Pro；并行环境扩至 512 提升 5.2pt，设备端性能提升 33%，云调用减少 40%。

Conclusion: MAI-UI 为 GUI 代理的实用化提供了系统性解决方案，实现性能、效率与隐私的协同优化，推动人机交互下一代发展。

Abstract: The development of GUI agents could revolutionize the next generation of human-computer interaction. Motivated by this vision, we present MAI-UI, a family of foundation GUI agents spanning the full spectrum of sizes, including 2B, 8B, 32B, and 235B-A22B variants. We identify four key challenges to realistic deployment: the lack of native agent-user interaction, the limits of UI-only operation, the absence of a practical deployment architecture, and brittleness in dynamic environments. MAI-UI addresses these issues with a unified methodology: a self-evolving data pipeline that expands the navigation data to include user interaction and MCP tool calls, a native device-cloud collaboration system routes execution by task state, and an online RL framework with advanced optimizations to scale parallel environments and context length. MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro. On mobile GUI navigation, it sets a new SOTA of 76.7% on AndroidWorld, surpassing UI-Tars-2, Gemini-2.5-Pro and Seed1.8. On MobileWorld, MAI-UI obtains 41.7% success rate, significantly outperforming end-to-end GUI models and competitive with Gemini-3-Pro based agentic frameworks. Our online RL experiments show significant gains from scaling parallel environments from 32 to 512 (+5.2 points) and increasing environment step budget from 15 to 50 (+4.3 points). Finally, the native device-cloud collaboration system improves on-device performance by 33%, reduces cloud model calls by over 40%, and preserves user privacy.

Abstract: Real-time, streaming interactive avatars represent a critical yet challenging goal in digital human research. Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

Abstract: Recent approaches have demonstrated the promise of using diffusion models to generate interactive and explorable worlds.

The framework comprises three core components: (1) a long-video generation framework integrating unified context compression with linear attention; (2) a real-time streaming acceleration strategy powered by bidirectional attention distillation and an enhanced text embedding scheme; (3) a text-controlled method for generating world events. We have provided the codebase in the supplementary material.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪方法要么依赖手工规则效率低，要么端到端训练计算复杂，亟需一种高效且数据驱动的解决方案。

Method: TDLP通过链接预测方法，在每帧中预测轨迹与检测框之间的正确关联，主要使用几何特征，可选加入姿态和外观信息。

Result: 在多个基准上超越了当前最先进的跟踪-by-检测和端到端方法，且链接预测比度量学习更有效。

Conclusion: TDLP为跟踪-by-检测提供了数据驱动的新范式，兼具高效性与高性能，尤其适合处理异构特征。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

Motivation: 现有基于反演的视觉编辑方法在采样过程中过度依赖源图像信息，导致无法有效执行如姿态、数量、颜色等指令性修改。

Method: 提出KV-mix在注意力机制中混合源与目标的KV特征，减轻源图像对编辑区域的影响；引入Latents-Shift对源潜在空间进行扰动，消除反演潜在变量的干扰。

Conclusion: ProEdit通过解耦源信息与编辑指令的依赖关系，显著提升指令驱动编辑的准确性与灵活性，为无训练编辑提供了新范式。

Abstract: Inversion-based visual editing provides an effective and training-free way to edit an image or a video based on user instructions. Existing methods typically inject source image information during the sampling process to maintain editing consistency. However, this sampling strategy overly relies on source information, which negatively affects the edits in the target image (e.g., failing to change the subject's atributes like pose, number, or color as instructed). In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling. Extensive experiments on several image and video editing benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance. In addition, our design is plug-and-play, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing inversion and editing methods, such as RF-Solver, FireFlow and UniEdit.

Result: 在8个基准上平均提升Qwen2.5-VL-7B 8.2%，具备强跨域泛化能力

Conclusion: BiPS有效增强模型对细粒度视觉证据的依赖，减少文本偏差，显著提升性能与泛化性

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often benefit from intermediate visual cues, either injected via external tools or generated as latent visual tokens during reasoning, but these mechanisms still overlook fine-grained visual evidence (e.g., polylines in charts), generalize poorly across domains, and incur high inference-time cost. In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.

Abstract: This thesis presents a physics-informed machine learning framework for solving the Floquet-Bloch eigenvalue problem associated with particles in two-dimensional periodic potentials, with a focus on honeycomb lattice geometry, due to its distinctive band topology featuring Dirac points and its relevance to materials such as graphene. By leveraging neural networks to learn complex Bloch functions and their associated eigenvalues (energies) simultaneously, we develop a mesh-free solver enforcing the governing Schrödinger equation, Bloch periodicity, and normalization constraints through a composite loss function without supervision. The model is trained over the Brillouin zone to recover band structures and Bloch modes, with numerical validation against traditional plane-wave expansion methods. We further explore transfer learning techniques to adapt the solver from nearly-free electron potentials to strongly varying potentials, demonstrating its ability to capture changes in band structure topology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在小样本生物医学数据上训练困难，亟需更高效的数据生成方法。

Method: 将数据生成视为强化学习策略优化问题，使用Proximal Policy Optimization结合判别器奖励进行训练。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV上性能媲美扩散模型且优于GAN，在更小的AI-READI上显著优于两者。

Conclusion: 强化学习为数据稀缺场景下的生物医学合成数据生成提供了高效且可靠的替代方案。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation (SDG) is a promising approach for enabling data sharing in biomedical studies while preserving patient privacy. Yet, state-of-the-art generative models often require large datasets and complex training procedures, limiting their applicability in small-sample settings. In this work, we reframe SDG as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem and introduce RLSyn, a novel framework that models the data generator as a stochastic policy over patient records and optimizes it using Proximal Policy Optimization with discriminator-derived rewards, yielding more stable and data-efficient training. We evaluate RLSyn on two biomedical datasets - AI-READI and MIMIC-IV- and benchmark it against state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion-based methods across extensive privacy, utility, and fidelity evaluations. RL-Syn performs comparably to diffusion models and outperforms GANs on MIMIC-IV, while outperforming both diffusion models and GANs on the smaller AI-READI dataset. These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning provides a principled and effective alternative for synthetic biomedical data generation, particularly in data-scarce regimes.

Conclusion: 应建立学习驱动的新鲜度优化统一基础，以应对延迟决策、随机性与跨层设计等未来挑战。

Abstract: The age of information (AoI) has become a central measure of data freshness in modern wireless systems, yet existing surveys either focus on classical AoI formulations or provide broad discussions of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks without addressing freshness as a unified learning problem. Motivated by this gap, this survey examines RL specifically through the lens of AoI and generalized freshness optimization. We organize AoI and its variants into native, function-based, and application-oriented families, providing a clearer view of how freshness should be modeled in B5G and 6G systems. Building on this foundation, we introduce a policy-centric taxonomy that reflects the decisions most relevant to freshness, consisting of update-control RL, medium-access RL, risk-sensitive RL, and multi-agent RL. This structure provides a coherent framework for understanding how learning can support sampling, scheduling, trajectory planning, medium access, and distributed coordination. We further synthesize recent progress in RL-driven freshness control and highlight open challenges related to delayed decision processes, stochastic variability, and cross-layer design. The goal is to establish a unified foundation for learning-based freshness optimization in next-generation wireless networks.

Motivation: 现有压缩质量评估计算成本高，难以在大规模科学数据中实时应用。

Result: 在四个真实科学应用中，预测误差普遍低于10%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DeepCQ为科学用户提供了高效、通用的质量预测工具，支持基于质量需求的智能压缩决策。

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression techniques have become vital for scientific data management and analytics, given the ever-increasing volume of data generated by modern scientific simulations and instruments. Nevertheless, assessing data quality post-compression remains computationally expensive due to the intensive nature of metric calculations. In this work, we present a general-purpose deep-surrogate framework for lossy compression quality prediction (DeepCQ), with the following key contributions: 1) We develop a surrogate model for compression quality prediction that is generalizable to different error-bounded lossy compressors, quality metrics, and input datasets; 2) We adopt a novel two-stage design that decouples the computationally expensive feature-extraction stage from the light-weight metrics prediction, enabling efficient training and modular inference; 3) We optimize the model performance on time-evolving data using a mixture-of-experts design. Such a design enhances the robustness when predicting across simulation timesteps, especially when the training and test data exhibit significant variation. We validate the effectiveness of DeepCQ on four real-world scientific applications. Our results highlight the framework's exceptional predictive accuracy, with prediction errors generally under 10\% across most settings, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our framework empowers scientific users to make informed decisions about data compression based on their preferred data quality, thereby significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in scientific data analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源MDLMs并行解码效率低，且蒸馏方法受限于基模型质量，难以超越自回归模型。

Method: 提出dUltra，基于GRPO的在线策略强化学习框架，引入未遮蔽规划头，联合优化扩散模型与解码顺序。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务中，dUltra在精度-效率权衡上优于现有启发式和蒸馏基线。

Conclusion: dUltra推动了扩散模型在解码效率上实现对自回归模型的超越（diffusion supremacy）。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) offer the potential for parallel token generation, but most open-source MDLMs decode fewer than 5 tokens per model forward pass even with sophisticated sampling strategies. As a result, their sampling speeds are often comparable to AR + speculative decoding schemes, limiting their advantage over mainstream autoregressive approaches. Existing distillation-based accelerators (dParallel, d3LLM) finetune MDLMs on trajectories generated by a base model, which can become off-policy during finetuning and restrict performance to the quality of the base model's samples. We propose \texttt{dUltra}, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that learns unmasking strategies for efficient parallel decoding. dUltra introduces an unmasking planner head that predicts per-token unmasking likelihoods under independent Bernoulli distributions. We jointly optimize the base diffusion LLM and the unmasking order planner using reward signals combining verifiable reward, distillation reward, and the number of unmasking steps. Across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks, dUltra improves the accuracy--efficiency trade-off over state-of-the-art heuristic and distillation baselines, moving towards achieving ``diffusion supremacy'' over autoregressive models.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅复现了已知结果，还新建立了变换结构与现代优化几何经验观察之间的联系。

Abstract: Many theoretical results in deep learning can be traced to symmetry or equivariance of neural networks under parameter transformations. However, existing analyses are typically problem-specific and focus on first-order consequences such as conservation laws, while the implications for second-order structure remain less understood. We develop a general equivariance toolbox that yields coupled first- and second-order constraints on learning dynamics. The framework extends classical Noether-type analyses in three directions: from gradient constraints to Hessian constraints, from symmetry to general equivariance, and from continuous to discrete transformations. At the first order, our framework unifies conservation laws and implicit-bias relations as special cases of a single identity. At the second order, it provides structural predictions about curvature: which directions are flat or sharp, how the gradient aligns with Hessian eigenspaces, and how the loss landscape geometry reflects the underlying transformation structure. We illustrate the framework through several applications, recovering known results while also deriving new characterizations that connect transformation structure to modern empirical observations about optimization geometry.

RLLaVA decouples RL algorithmic logic from model architecture and distributed execution, supporting researchers in implementing new RL algorithms with minimal code, and to plug in a broad family of RL methods and vision-language models (VLMs) while remaining agnostic to specific training and inference engines.

Motivation: 新冠疫情导致医疗系统中断和行为变化，传统统计方法难以应对结构突变，需更可靠的反事实死亡率估计方法。

Method: 比较SARIMA与三种深度学习模型（LSTM、Seq2Seq、Transformer），使用2015-2019年CDC数据训练，2020-2023年预测，采用共形预测区间和60+次试验验证。

Result: LSTM的MAPE为17.08%，低于SARIMA的23.88%；预测区间覆盖率68.8%高于SARIMA的47.9%；注意力模型因过拟合历史均值表现较差。

Conclusion: 经过严格验证的深度学习模型比传统方法更适合公共卫生规划中的反事实估计，但需注意校准技术以应对高风险场景。

Abstract: Substance overdose mortality in the United States claimed over 80,000 lives in 2023, with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating existing trends through healthcare disruptions and behavioral changes. Estimating excess mortality, defined as deaths beyond expected levels based on pre-pandemic patterns, is essential for understanding pandemic impacts and informing intervention strategies. However, traditional statistical methods like SARIMA assume linearity, stationarity, and fixed seasonality, which may not hold under structural disruptions. We present a systematic comparison of SARIMA against three deep learning (DL) architectures (LSTM, Seq2Seq, and Transformer) for counterfactual mortality estimation using national CDC data (2015-2019 for training/validation, 2020-2023 for projection). We contribute empirical evidence that LSTM achieves superior point estimation (17.08% MAPE vs. 23.88% for SARIMA) and better-calibrated uncertainty (68.8% vs. 47.9% prediction interval coverage) when projecting under regime change. We also demonstrate that attention-based models (Seq2Seq, Transformer) underperform due to overfitting to historical means rather than capturing emergent trends. Ourreproducible pipeline incorporates conformal prediction intervals and convergence analysis across 60+ trials per configuration, and we provide an open-source framework deployable with 15 state health departments. Our findings establish that carefully validated DL models can provide more reliable counterfactual estimates than traditional methods for public health planning, while highlighting the need for calibration techniques when deploying neural forecasting in high-stakes domains.

Conclusion: RR-FBTC实现了张量秩的自动学习与高效推断，提升了对连续信号的建模能力。

Abstract: Functional tensor decomposition can analyze multi-dimensional data with real-valued indices, paving the path for applications in machine learning and signal processing. A limitation of existing approaches is the assumption that the tensor rank-a critical parameter governing model complexity-is known. However, determining the optimal rank is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) task and there is a limited understanding regarding the expressive power of functional low-rank tensor models for continuous signals. We propose a rank-revealing functional Bayesian tensor completion (RR-FBTC) method. Modeling the latent functions through carefully designed multioutput Gaussian processes, RR-FBTC handles tensors with real-valued indices while enabling automatic tensor rank determination during the inference process. We establish the universal approximation property of the model for continuous multi-dimensional signals, demonstrating its expressive power in a concise format. To learn this model, we employ the variational inference framework and derive an efficient algorithm with closed-form updates. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the RR-FBTC over state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: As wearable sensing becomes increasingly pervasive, a key challenge remains: how can we generate natural language summaries from raw physiological signals such as actigraphy - minute-level movement data collected via accelerometers? In this work, we introduce MotionTeller, a generative framework that natively integrates minute-level wearable activity data with large language models (LLMs). MotionTeller combines a pretrained actigraphy encoder with a lightweight projection module that maps behavioral embeddings into the token space of a frozen decoder-only LLM, enabling free-text, autoregressive generation of daily behavioral summaries. We construct a novel dataset of 54383 (actigraphy, text) pairs derived from real-world NHANES recordings, and train the model using cross-entropy loss with supervision only on the language tokens. MotionTeller achieves high semantic fidelity (BERTScore-F1 = 0.924) and lexical accuracy (ROUGE-1 = 0.722), outperforming prompt-based baselines by 7 percent in ROUGE-1. The average training loss converges to 0.38 by epoch 15, indicating stable optimization. Qualitative analysis confirms that MotionTeller captures circadian structure and behavioral transitions, while PCA plots reveal enhanced cluster alignment in embedding space post-training. Together, these results position MotionTeller as a scalable, interpretable system for transforming wearable sensor data into fluent, human-centered descriptions, introducing new pathways for behavioral monitoring, clinical review, and personalized health interventions.

Conclusion: TreeEIC有效解决了缺失模式不一致导致的利用不足问题，通过树结构与知识蒸馏实现了更高效和鲁棒的多视图聚类

Abstract: Real-world multi-view data usually exhibits highly inconsistent missing patterns which challenges the effectiveness of incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC). Although existing IMVC methods have made progress from both imputation-based and imputation-free routes, they have overlooked the pair under-utilization issue, i.e., inconsistent missing patterns make the incomplete but available multi-view pairs unable to be fully utilized, thereby limiting the model performance. To address this, we propose a novel missing-pattern tree based IMVC framework entitled TreeEIC. Specifically, to achieve full exploitation of available multi-view pairs, TreeEIC first defines the missing-pattern tree model to group data into multiple decision sets according to different missing patterns, and then performs multi-view clustering within each set. Furthermore, a multi-view decision ensemble module is proposed to aggregate clustering results from all decision sets, which infers uncertainty-based weights to suppress unreliable clustering decisions and produce robust decisions. Finally, an ensemble-to-individual knowledge distillation module transfers the ensemble knowledge to view-specific clustering models, which enables ensemble and individual modules to promote each other by optimizing cross-view consistency and inter-cluster discrimination losses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TreeEIC achieves state-of-the-art IMVC performance and exhibits superior robustness under highly inconsistent missing patterns.

Abstract: Continual Pre-training (CPT) serves as a fundamental approach for adapting foundation models to domain-specific applications. Scaling laws for pre-training define a power-law relationship between dataset size and the test loss of an LLM. However, the marginal gains from simply increasing data for CPT diminish rapidly, yielding suboptimal data utilization and inefficient training. To address this challenge, we propose a novel perplexity-aware data scaling law to establish a predictive relationship between the perplexity landscape of domain-specific data and the test loss. Our approach leverages the perplexity derived from the pre-trained model on domain data as a proxy for estimating the knowledge gap, effectively quantifying the informational perplexity landscape of candidate training samples. By fitting this scaling law across diverse perplexity regimes, we enable adaptive selection of high-utility data subsets, prioritizing content that maximizes knowledge absorption while minimizing redundancy and noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently identifies near-optimal training subsets and achieves superior performance on both medical and general-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: 所提统一框架无需数据填补，有效提升对比学习在复杂多视图场景下的聚类效果。

Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL) plays an important role in exploring complementary information for multi-view clustering (MVC) and has attracted increasing attention. Nevertheless, real-world multi-view data suffer from data incompleteness or noise, resulting in rare-paired samples or mis-paired samples which significantly challenges the effectiveness of CL-based MVC. That is, rare-paired issue prevents MVC from extracting sufficient multi-view complementary information, and mis-paired issue causes contrastive learning to optimize the model in the wrong direction. To address these issues, we propose a unified CL-based MVC framework for enhancing clustering effectiveness on incomplete and noise multi-view data. First, to overcome the rare-paired issue, we design a global-graph guided contrastive learning, where all view samples construct a global-view affinity graph to form new sample pairs for fully exploring complementary information. Second, to mitigate the mis-paired issue, we propose a local-graph weighted contrastive learning, which leverages local neighbors to generate pair-wise weights to adaptively strength or weaken the pair-wise contrastive learning. Our method is imputation-free and can be integrated into a unified global-local graph-guided contrastive learning framework. Extensive experiments on both incomplete and noise settings of multi-view data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: 理论保障经私有深度学习任务实验验证，支持实用化部署与隐私增强

Conclusion: Fed-$α$-NormEC是首个在实用假设下同时支持关键FL特性与严格隐私保证的框架

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training on decentralized data. Differential privacy (DP) is crucial for FL, but current private methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., bounded gradients or heterogeneity), hindering practical application. Existing works that relax these assumptions typically neglect practical FL features, including multiple local updates and partial client participation. We introduce Fed-$α$-NormEC, the first differentially private FL framework providing provable convergence and DP guarantees under standard assumptions while fully supporting these practical features. Fed-$α$-NormE integrates local updates (full and incremental gradient steps), separate server and client stepsizes, and, crucially, partial client participation, which is essential for real-world deployment and vital for privacy amplification. Our theoretical guarantees are corroborated by experiments on private deep learning tasks.

Abstract: Conventional Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, typically focused on estimating or maximizing expected returns, face challenges when refining offline pretrained models with online experiences. This paper introduces Generative Actor Critic (GAC), a novel framework that decouples sequential decision-making by reframing \textit{policy evaluation} as learning a generative model of the joint distribution over trajectories and returns, $p(τ, y)$, and \textit{policy improvement} as performing versatile inference on this learned model. To operationalize GAC, we introduce a specific instantiation based on a latent variable model that features continuous latent plan vectors. We develop novel inference strategies for both \textit{exploitation}, by optimizing latent plans to maximize expected returns, and \textit{exploration}, by sampling latent plans conditioned on dynamically adjusted target returns. Experiments on Gym-MuJoCo and Maze2D benchmarks demonstrate GAC's strong offline performance and significantly enhanced offline-to-online improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods, even in absence of step-wise rewards.

Abstract: Accurate identification of antiviral peptides (AVPs) is critical for accelerating novel drug development. However, current computational methods struggle to capture intricate sequence dependencies and effectively handle ambiguous, hard-to-classify samples. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Fusion, a novel two-stage deep learning framework integrating adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. Unlike traditional static feature concatenation, we construct a panoramic feature space using 10 distinct descriptors and introduce an Adaptive Gating Mechanism.This mechanism dynamically regulates the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Furthermore, to address data distribution challenges, we employ a contrastive learning strategy driven by Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM) and BLOSUM62-based data augmentation, which significantly sharpens the model's decision boundaries. Experimental results on the benchmark Set 1 dataset demonstrate that AVP-Fusion achieves an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. In the second stage, leveraging transfer learning, the model enables precise subclass prediction for six viral families and eight specific viruses, even under limited sample sizes. In summary, AVP-Fusion serves as a robust and interpretable tool for high-throughput antiviral drug screening.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 锚点分层策略有效利用异构特征与稀疏空间结构，提升归纳式时空预测精度。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal kriging is a fundamental problem in sensor networks, driven by the sparsity of deployed sensors and the resulting missing observations. Although recent approaches model spatial and temporal correlations, they often under-exploit two practical characteristics of real deployments: the sparse spatial distribution of locations and the heterogeneous availability of auxiliary features across locations. To address these challenges, we propose AnchorGK, an Anchor-based Incremental and Stratified Graph Learning framework for inductive spatio-temporal kriging. AnchorGK introduces anchor locations to stratify the data in a principled manner. Anchors are constructed according to feature availability, and strata are then formed around these anchors. This stratification serves two complementary roles. First, it explicitly represents and continuously updates correlations between unobserved regions and surrounding observed locations within a graph learning framework. Second, it enables the systematic use of all available features across strata via an incremental representation mechanism, mitigating feature incompleteness without discarding informative signals. Building on the stratified structure, we design a dual-view graph learning layer that jointly aggregates feature-relevant and location-relevant information, learning stratum-specific representations that support accurate inference under inductive settings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnchorGK consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for spatio-temporal kriging.

Result: 在多个金融基准上，RefineBridge显著提升了主流TSFM在不同预测时域的性能

Conclusion: RefineBridge通过生成式框架有效弥补TSFM在金融数据上的缺陷，是更优的微调方法

Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is particularly challenging for transformer-based time series foundation models (TSFMs) due to non-stationarity, heavy-tailed distributions, and high-frequency noise present in data. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient method for adapting pre-trained TSFMs to downstream data domains. However, it still underperforms in financial data, as it preserves the network architecture and training objective of TSFMs rather than complementing the foundation model. To further enhance TSFMs, we propose a novel refinement module, RefineBridge, built upon a tractable Schrödinger Bridge (SB) generative framework. Given the forecasts of TSFM as generative prior and the observed ground truths as targets, RefineBridge learns context-conditioned stochastic transport maps to improve TSFM predictions, iteratively approaching the ground-truth target from even a low-quality prior. Simulations on multiple financial benchmarks demonstrate that RefineBridge consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs across different prediction horizons.

Result: 在24/28个视觉任务上超越SOTA方法，部分任务达到专家水平，仅需极少量交互。

Conclusion: 首次证明视频可支持无额外监督的极高样本效率视觉策略学习。

Abstract: Humans can efficiently extract knowledge and learn skills from the videos within only a few trials and errors. However, it poses a big challenge to replicate this learning process for autonomous agents, due to the complexity of visual input, the absence of action or reward signals, and the limitations of interaction steps. In this paper, we propose a novel, unsupervised, and sample-efficient framework to achieve imitation learning from videos (ILV), named Behavior Cloning from Videos via Latent Representations (BCV-LR). BCV-LR extracts action-related latent features from high-dimensional video inputs through self-supervised tasks, and then leverages a dynamics-based unsupervised objective to predict latent actions between consecutive frames. The pre-trained latent actions are fine-tuned and efficiently aligned to the real action space online (with collected interactions) for policy behavior cloning. The cloned policy in turn enriches the agent experience for further latent action finetuning, resulting in an iterative policy improvement that is highly sample-efficient.
  We conduct extensive experiments on a set of challenging visual tasks, including both discrete control and continuous control. BCV-LR enables effective (even expert-level on some tasks) policy performance with only a few interactions, surpassing state-of-the-art ILV baselines and reinforcement learning methods (provided with environmental rewards) in terms of sample efficiency across 24/28 tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this work for the first time demonstrates that videos can support extremely sample-efficient visual policy learning, without the need to access any other expert supervision.

Conclusion: 在高风险、时间敏感的急诊环境中，模型的鲁棒性和计算效率比架构复杂性更重要，树集成方法目前是最实用、最符合临床需求的选择。

Abstract: Emergency and intensive care environments require predictive models that are both accurate and computationally efficient, yet clinical data in these settings are often severely imbalanced. Such skewness undermines model reliability, particularly for rare but clinically crucial outcomes, making robustness and scalability essential for real-world usage. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the robustness and scalability of classical machine learning models on imbalanced tabular data from MIMIC-IV-ED and eICU. Class imbalance was quantified using complementary metrics, and we compared the performance of tree-based methods, the state-of-the-art TabNet deep learning model, and a custom lightweight residual network. TabResNet was designed as a computationally efficient alternative to TabNet, replacing its complex attention mechanisms with a streamlined residual architecture to maintain representational capacity for real-time clinical use. All models were optimized via a Bayesian hyperparameter search and assessed on predictive performance, robustness to increasing imbalance, and computational scalability. Our results, on seven clinically vital predictive tasks, show that tree-based methods, particularly XGBoost, consistently achieved the most stable performance across imbalance levels and scaled efficiently with sample size. Deep tabular models degraded more sharply under imbalance and incurred higher computational costs, while TabResNet provided a lighter alternative to TabNet but did not surpass ensemble benchmarks. These findings indicate that in emergency and critical care, robustness to imbalance and computational scalability could outweigh architectural complexity. Tree-based ensemble methods currently offer the most practical and clinically feasible choice, equipping practitioners with a framework for selecting models suited to high-stakes, time-sensitive environments.

Abstract: This study presents a data-driven, multi-objective approach to predict the mechanical performance, flow ability, and porosity of Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC). Out of 21 machine learning algorithms tested, five high-performing models are selected, with XGBoost showing the best accuracy after hyperparameter tuning using Random Search and K-Fold Cross-Validation. The framework follows a two-stage process: the initial XGBoost model is built using raw data, and once selected as the final model, the dataset is cleaned by (1) removing multicollinear features, (2) identifying outliers with Isolation Forest, and (3) selecting important features using SHAP analysis. The refined dataset as model 2 is then used to retrain XGBoost, which achieves high prediction accuracy across all outputs. A graphical user interface (GUI) is also developed to support material designers. Overall, the proposed framework significantly improves the prediction accuracy and minimizes the need for extensive experimental testing in UHPC mix design.

Abstract: Parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are fundamental for modeling a wide range of physical and engineering systems influenced by uncertain or varying parameters. Traditional neural network-based solvers, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Deep Galerkin Methods, often face challenges in generalization and long-time prediction efficiency due to their dependence on full space-time approximations. To address these issues, we propose a novel and scalable framework that significantly enhances the Neural Galerkin Method (NGM) by incorporating the Meta-Auto-Decoder (MAD) paradigm. Our approach leverages space-time decoupling to enable more stable and efficient time integration, while meta-learning-driven adaptation allows rapid generalization to unseen parameter configurations with minimal retraining. Furthermore, randomized sparse updates effectively reduce computational costs without compromising accuracy. Together, these advancements enable our method to achieve physically consistent, long-horizon predictions for complex parameterized evolution equations with significantly lower computational overhead. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate that our methods performs comparatively well in terms of accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能实现高精度、可解释且泛化性强的混凝土性能预测，为混凝土配比优化与结构性能评估提供可靠工具。

Abstract: This research develops and evaluates machine learning models to predict the mechanical properties of steel-polypropylene fiber-reinforced high-performance concrete (HPC). Three model families were investigated: Extra Trees with XGBoost (ET-XGB), Random Forest with LightGBM (RF-LGBM), and Transformer with XGBoost (Transformer-XGB). The target properties included compressive strength (CS), flexural strength (FS), and tensile strength (TS), based on an extensive dataset compiled from published experimental studies. Model training involved k-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), and uncertainty analysis to ensure both robustness and interpretability. Among the tested approaches, the ET-XGB model achieved the highest overall accuracy, with testing R^2 values of 0.994 for CS, 0.944 for FS, and 0.978 for TS and exhibited lowest uncertainty for CS and TS (approximately 13-16% and 30.4%, respectively). The RF-LGBM model provided the most stable and reliable predictions for FS (R^2 0.977), yielding the lowest uncertainty for FS (approximately 5-33%). The Transformer-XGB model demonstrated strong predictive capability (R^2 0.978 for TS and 0.967 for FS) but consistently showed the highest uncertainty, indicating reduced generalization reliability. SHAP analysis further indicated that fiber aspect ratios (AR1 and AR2), silica fume (Sfu), and steel fiber content (SF) were the most influential predictors of strength, whereas water content (W) and the water-binder ratio (w/b) consistently had negative effects. The findings confirm that machine learning models can provide accurate, interpretable, and generalizable predictions of HPC mechanical properties. These models offer valuable tools for optimizing concrete mix design and enhancing structural performance evaluation in engineering applications.

Conclusion: Inverse-RPO为设计 principled 带先验UCT提供了统一框架，方差感知UCT是其成功实例，推动MCTS理论与实践发展。

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has profoundly influenced reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating planning and learning in tasks requiring long-horizon reasoning, exemplified by the AlphaZero family of algorithms. Central to MCTS is the search strategy, governed by a tree policy based on an upper confidence bound (UCB) applied to trees (UCT). A key factor in the success of AlphaZero is the introduction of a prior term in the UCB1-based tree policy PUCT, which improves exploration efficiency and thus accelerates training. While many alternative UCBs with stronger theoretical guarantees than UCB1 exist, extending them to prior-based UCTs has been challenging, since PUCT was derived empirically rather than from first principles. Recent work retrospectively justified PUCT by framing MCTS as a regularized policy optimization (RPO) problem. Building on this perspective, we introduce Inverse-RPO, a general methodology that systematically derives prior-based UCTs from any prior-free UCB. Applying this method to the variance-aware UCB-V, we obtain two new prior-based tree policies that incorporate variance estimates into the search. Experiments indicate that these variance-aware prior-based UCTs outperform PUCT across multiple benchmarks without incurring additional computational cost. We also provide an extension of the mctx library supporting variance-aware UCTs, showing that the required code changes are minimal and intended to facilitate further research on principled prior-based UCTs.

Conclusion: Causal-HM通过显式建模物理因果关系，有效提升多模态无监督异常检测的准确性与可解释性。

Abstract: Multimodal Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) is critical for quality assurance in smart manufacturing, particularly in complex processes like robotic welding. However, existing methods often suffer from causal blindness, treating process modalities (e.g., real-time video, audio, and sensors) and result modalities (e.g., post-weld images) as equal feature sources, thereby ignoring the inherent physical generative logic. Furthermore, the heterogeneity gap between high-dimensional visual data and low-dimensional sensor signals frequently leads to critical process context being drowned out. In this paper, we propose Causal-HM, a unified multimodal UAD framework that explicitly models the physical Process to Result dependency. Specifically, our framework incorporates two key innovations: a Sensor-Guided CHM Modulation mechanism that utilizes low-dimensional sensor signals as context to guide high-dimensional audio-visual feature extraction , and a Causal-Hierarchical Architecture that enforces a unidirectional generative mapping to identify anomalies that violate physical consistency. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed Weld-4M benchmark across four modalities demonstrate that Causal-HM achieves a state-of-the-art (SOTA) I-AUROC of 90.7%. Code will be released after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 输出匹配在1比特量化中可行，关键在于控制激活误差累积；所提方法为高效低比特部署提供了新路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deliver strong performance across a wide range of NLP tasks, but their massive sizes hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. To reduce their computational and memory burden, various compression techniques have been proposed, including quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Among these, post-training quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted for its efficiency, as it requires no retraining and only a small dataset for calibration, enabling low-cost deployment. Recent advances for post-training quantization have demonstrated that even sub-4-bit methods can maintain most of the original model performance. However, 1-bit quantization that converts floating-point weights to \(\pm\)1, remains particularly challenging, as existing 1-bit PTQ methods often suffer from significant performance degradation compared to the full-precision models. Specifically, most of existing 1-bit PTQ approaches focus on weight alignment, aligning the full-precision model weights with those of the quantized models, rather than directly aligning their outputs. Although the output-matching approach objective is more intuitive and aligns with the quantization goal, naively applying it in 1-bit LLMs often leads to notable performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate why and under what conditions output-matching fails, in the context of 1-bit LLM quantization. Based on our findings, we propose a novel data-aware PTQ approach for 1-bit LLMs that explicitly accounts for activation error accumulation while keeping optimization efficient. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our solution consistently outperforms existing 1-bit PTQ methods with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are widely used for distribution learning, yet their classical formulations remain theoretically fragile, with ill-posed objectives, unstable training dynamics, and limited interpretability. In this work, we introduce \emph{Dictionary-Transform Generative Adversarial Networks} (DT-GAN), a fully model-based adversarial framework in which the generator is a sparse synthesis dictionary and the discriminator is an analysis transform acting as an energy model. By restricting both players to linear operators with explicit constraints, DT-GAN departs fundamentally from neural GAN architectures and admits rigorous theoretical analysis.
  We show that the DT-GAN adversarial game is well posed and admits at least one Nash equilibrium. Under a sparse generative model, equilibrium solutions are provably identifiable up to standard permutation and sign ambiguities and exhibit a precise geometric alignment between synthesis and analysis operators. We further establish finite-sample stability and consistency of empirical equilibria, demonstrating that DT-GAN training converges reliably under standard sampling assumptions and remains robust in heavy-tailed regimes.
  Experiments on mixture-structured synthetic data validate the theoretical predictions, showing that DT-GAN consistently recovers underlying structure and exhibits stable behavior under identical optimization budgets where a standard GAN degrades. DT-GAN is not proposed as a universal replacement for neural GANs, but as a principled adversarial alternative for data distributions that admit sparse synthesis structure. The results demonstrate that adversarial learning can be made interpretable, stable, and provably correct when grounded in classical sparse modeling.

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation services such as navigation and ride-hailing. In such applications, uncertainty estimation in forecasting is important because it helps evaluate traffic risk levels, assess forecast reliability, and provide timely warnings. As a result, probabilistic traffic flow forecasting (PTFF) has gained significant attention, as it produces both point forecasts and uncertainty estimates. However, existing PTFF approaches still face two key challenges: (1) how to uncover and model the causes of traffic flow uncertainty for reliable forecasting, and (2) how to capture the spatiotemporal correlations of uncertainty for accurate prediction.
  To address these challenges, we propose RIPCN, a Road Impedance Principal Component Network that integrates domain-specific transportation theory with spatiotemporal principal component learning for PTFF. RIPCN introduces a dynamic impedance evolution network that captures directional traffic transfer patterns driven by road congestion level and flow variability, revealing the direct causes of uncertainty and enhancing both reliability and interpretability. In addition, a principal component network is designed to forecast the dominant eigenvectors of future flow covariance, enabling the model to capture spatiotemporal uncertainty correlations. This design allows for accurate and efficient uncertainty estimation while also improving point prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms existing probabilistic forecasting methods.

Beneath their apparent diversity lies a recurring pattern: smaller "compressor" LMs (that can even run locally) distill raw context into compact text that is then consumed by larger "predictor" LMs. Despite their popularity, the design of compressor-predictor systems remains largely ad hoc, with little guidance on how compressor and predictor choices shape downstream performance. In practice, attributing gains to compression versus prediction requires costly, task-specific pairwise sweeps. We argue that these agentic system design questions are, at root, information-theoretic. Viewing the compressor LM as a noisy channel, we introduce a simple estimator of mutual information between the context and its compression to quantify compression quality in a task-independent way. We show that mutual information strongly predicts downstream performance, independent of any specific task. Through an information-theoretic framework, we perform a comprehensive empirical analysis across five datasets and three model families. Results reveal that larger compressors not only are more accurate, but also more token-efficient, conveying more bits of information per token. A 7B Qwen-2.5 compressor, for instance, is $1.6\times$ more accurate, $4.6\times$ more concise, and conveys $5.5\times$ more bits of mutual information per token than its 1.5B sibling. Across datasets, scaling compressors is substantially more effective than scaling predictors, enabling larger on-device compressors to pair with smaller cloud predictors. Applied to a Deep Research system, these principles enable local compressors as small as 3B parameters to recover $99\%$ of frontier-LM accuracy at $26\%$ of API costs.

Motivation: 现有方法对所有层统一处理，难以平衡稳定性与可塑性，且忽视了不同层在任务分类中熵值差异导致的欠拟合与过拟合问题。

Method: 引入动态反馈机制，根据各层熵值自适应调节：高熵层降低熵以缓解欠拟合，低熵层提高熵以减轻过拟合，促进模型收敛到更宽的极小值。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有持续学习基线方法，且可与回放和正则化方法无缝集成。

Conclusion: 熵感知的动态调节机制有效提升了持续学习的性能，为层间差异建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Continual learning aims to acquire new tasks while preserving performance on previously learned ones, but most methods struggle with catastrophic forgetting. Existing approaches typically treat all layers uniformly, often trading stability for plasticity or vice versa. However, different layers naturally exhibit varying levels of uncertainty (entropy) when classifying tasks. High-entropy layers tend to underfit by failing to capture task-specific patterns, while low-entropy layers risk overfitting by becoming overly confident and specialized. To address this imbalance, we propose an entropy-aware continual learning method that employs a dynamic feedback mechanism to regulate each layer based on its entropy. Specifically, our approach reduces entropy in high-entropy layers to mitigate underfitting and increases entropy in overly confident layers to alleviate overfitting. This adaptive regulation encourages the model to converge to wider local minima, which have been shown to improve generalization. Our method is general and can be seamlessly integrated with both replay- and regularization-based approaches. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art continual learning baselines.

Result: 在合成与准真实数据的分类任务中，CENNET相比现有方法能提供更有效的因果解释。

Conclusion: CENNET有效实现了神经网络预测的因果解释，为表格数据的可解释性提供了新途径。

Abstract: The problem of explaining the results produced by machine learning methods continues to attract attention. Neural network (NN) models, along with gradient boosting machines, are expected to be utilized even in tabular data with high prediction accuracy. This study addresses the related issues of pseudo-correlation, causality, and combinatorial reasons for tabular data in NN predictors. We propose a causal explanation method, CENNET, and a new explanation power index using entropy for the method. CENNET provides causal explanations for predictions by NNs and uses structural causal models (SCMs) effectively combined with the NNs although SCMs are usually not used as predictive models on their own in terms of predictive accuracy. We show that CEN-NET provides such explanations through comparative experiments with existing methods on both synthetic and quasi-real data in classification tasks.

Abstract: We derive an approximation error bound that holds simultaneously for a function and all its derivatives up to any prescribed order. The bounds apply to elementary functions, including multivariate polynomials, the exponential function, and the reciprocal function, and are obtained using feedforward neural networks with the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) activation. In addition, we report the network size, weight magnitudes, and behavior at infinity. Our analysis begins with a constructive approximation of multiplication, where we prove the simultaneous validity of error bounds over domains of increasing size for a given approximator. Leveraging this result, we obtain approximation guarantees for division and the exponential function, ensuring that all higher-order derivatives of the resulting approximators remain globally bounded.

Abstract: Genomic prediction of drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains challenging due to complex epistatic interactions and highly variable sequencing data quality. We present a novel Interpretable Variant-Aware Multi-Path Network (VAMP-Net) that addresses both challenges through complementary machine learning pathways. Path-1 employs a Set Attention Transformer processing permutation-invariant variant sets to capture epistatic interactions between genomic loci. Path-2 utilizes a 1D Convolutional Neural Network that analyzes Variant Call Format quality metrics to learn adaptive confidence scores. A fusion module combines both pathways for final resistance classification. We conduct comparative evaluations of unmasked versus padding-masked Set Attention Blocks, and demonstrate that our multi-path architecture achieves superior performance over baseline CNN and MLP models, with accuracy exceeding 95% and AUC around 97% for Rifampicin (RIF) and Rifabutin (RFB) resistance prediction. The framework provides dual-layer interpretability: Attention Weight Analysis reveals Epistatic networks, and Integrated Gradients (IG) was applied for critical resistance loci (notably rpoB), while gradient-based feature importance from the CNN pathway uncovers drug-specific dependencies on data quality metrics. This architecture advances clinical genomics by delivering state-of-the-art predictive performance alongside auditable interpretability at two distinct levels, genetic causality of mutation sets and technical confidence of sequencing evidence, establishing a new paradigm for robust, clinically-actionable resistance prediction.

Motivation: 金融数据稀缺与保密性阻碍了模型开发与测试，需可靠合成数据替代真实数据。

Method: 基于标普500日数据，评估ARIMA-GARCH、VAE和TimeGAN三类生成模型，从保真度（MMD）、时序结构（自相关与波动聚集）和下游任务（投资组合优化、波动预测）三个维度进行综合评价。

Result: ARIMA-GARCH能捕捉线性趋势但忽视非线性动态；VAE生成轨迹平滑，低估极端事件；TimeGAN在MMD（1.84e-3）和时序一致性上最优，综合表现最佳。

Conclusion: 提出基于应用场景与计算资源的生成模型选择指南，并发布可复现代码，推动金融合成数据评估标准化。

Abstract: Data scarcity and confidentiality in finance often impede model development and robust testing. This paper presents a unified multi-criteria evaluation framework for synthetic financial data and applies it to three representative generative paradigms: the statistical ARIMA-GARCH baseline, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Time-series Generative Adversarial Networks (TimeGAN). Using historical S and P 500 daily data, we evaluate fidelity (Maximum Mean Discrepancy, MMD), temporal structure (autocorrelation and volatility clustering), and practical utility in downstream tasks, specifically mean-variance portfolio optimization and volatility forecasting. Empirical results indicate that ARIMA-GARCH captures linear trends and conditional volatility but fails to reproduce nonlinear dynamics; VAEs produce smooth trajectories that underestimate extreme events; and TimeGAN achieves the best trade-off between realism and temporal coherence (e.g., TimeGAN attained the lowest MMD: 1.84e-3, average over 5 seeds). Finally, we articulate practical guidelines for selecting generative models according to application needs and computational constraints. Our unified evaluation protocol and reproducible codebase aim to standardize benchmarking in synthetic financial data research.

Motivation: GPU密集型AI数据中心采用液冷后，冷却液泄漏导致非计划停机和能源浪费，亟需主动预警系统。

Method: 结合LSTM神经网络进行泄漏概率预测，使用随机森林分类器实现瞬时检测，基于MQTT、InfluxDB和Streamlit构建监控系统。

Result: 在符合ASHRAE 2021标准的合成数据上，检测准确率达96.5%，预测准确率达87%（90%置信度下±30分钟），可提前2-4小时预警，1分钟内检测突发泄漏，预计年节电1500 kWh。

Conclusion: 系统在合成数据中验证了可行性，湿度、压力和流量为关键预测信号，温度因热惯性响应迟缓，为未来实际部署奠定基础。

Abstract: AI data centers which are GPU centric, have adopted liquid cooling to handle extreme heat loads, but coolant leaks result in substantial energy loss through unplanned shutdowns and extended repair periods. We present a proof-of-concept smart IoT monitoring system combining LSTM neural networks for probabilistic leak forecasting with Random Forest classifiers for instant detection. Testing on synthetic data aligned with ASHRAE 2021 standards, our approach achieves 96.5% detection accuracy and 87% forecasting accuracy at 90% probability within plus or minus 30-minute windows. Analysis demonstrates that humidity, pressure, and flow rate deliver strong predictive signals, while temperature exhibits minimal immediate response due to thermal inertia in server hardware. The system employs MQTT streaming, InfluxDB storage, and Streamlit dashboards, forecasting leaks 2-4 hours ahead while identifying sudden events within 1 minute. For a typical 47-rack facility, this approach could prevent roughly 1,500 kWh annual energy waste through proactive maintenance rather than reactive emergency procedures. While validation remains synthetic-only, results establish feasibility for future operational deployment in sustainable data center operations.

Motivation: 现有KL正则化实现方式存在梯度偏差，缺乏系统分析其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 分析多种KL估计器的梯度偏差，通过在Qwen2.5、Llama-3.1和Qwen3模型上进行RL微调实验验证。

Result: 无偏梯度配置提升训练稳定性与任务性能；KL正则化有助于稳定异步off-policy训练。

Conclusion: 正确设计KL估计器对RL训练至关重要，无偏估计器应成为标准实践。

Abstract: The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了高效、可解释、隐私安全的跨机构欺诈检测，适用于监管审计与实际部署，兼具数据压缩、模型透明与抗攻击能力。

Abstract: We propose an explainable, privacy-preserving dataset distillation framework for collaborative financial fraud detection. A trained random forest is converted into transparent, axis-aligned rule regions (leaf hyperrectangles), and synthetic transactions are generated by uniformly sampling within each region. This produces a compact, auditable surrogate dataset that preserves local feature interactions without exposing sensitive original records. The rule regions also support explainability: aggregated rule statistics (for example, support and lift) describe global patterns, while assigning each case to its generating region gives concise human-readable rationales and calibrated uncertainty based on tree-vote disagreement.
  On the IEEE-CIS fraud dataset (590k transactions across three institution-like clusters), distilled datasets reduce data volume by 85% to 93% (often under 15% of the original) while maintaining competitive precision and micro-F1, with only a modest AUC drop. Sharing and augmenting with synthesized data across institutions improves cross-cluster precision, recall, and AUC. Real vs. synthesized structure remains highly similar (over 93% by nearest-neighbor cosine analysis). Membership-inference attacks perform at chance level (about 0.50) when distinguishing training from hold-out records, suggesting low memorization risk. Removing high-uncertainty synthetic points using disagreement scores further boosts AUC (up to 0.687) and improves calibration. Sensitivity tests show weak dependence on the distillation ratio (AUC about 0.641 to 0.645 from 6% to 60%).
  Overall, tree-region distillation enables trustworthy, deployable fraud analytics with interpretable global rules, per-case rationales with quantified uncertainty, and strong privacy properties suitable for multi-institution settings and regulatory audit.

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of multimodal data fusion in high-dimensional biomedical informatics, we propose MMCTOP, a MultiModal Clinical-Trial Outcome Prediction framework that integrates heterogeneous biomedical signals spanning (i) molecular structure representations, (ii) protocol metadata and long-form eligibility narratives, and (iii) disease ontologies. MMCTOP couples schema-guided textualization and input-fidelity validation with modality-aware representation learning, in which domain-specific encoders generate aligned embeddings that are fused by a transformer backbone augmented with a drug-disease-conditioned sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE). This design explicitly supports specialization across therapeutic and design subspaces while maintaining scalable computation through top-k routing. MMCTOP achieves consistent improvements in precision, F1, and AUC over unimodal and multimodal baselines on benchmark datasets, and ablations show that schema-guided textualization and selective expert routing contribute materially to performance and stability. We additionally apply temperature scaling to obtain calibrated probabilities, ensuring reliable risk estimation for downstream decision support. Overall, MMCTOP advances multimodal trial modeling by combining controlled narrative normalization, context-conditioned expert fusion, and operational safeguards aimed at auditability and reproducibility in biomedical informatics.

Conclusion: GQ-VAE是可行的BPE替代方案，未来可探索更优架构与训练策略。

Abstract: While most frontier models still use deterministic frequency-based tokenization algorithms such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), there has been significant recent work to design learned neural tokenizers. However, these schemes generally add to underlying language model complexity and force large changes to architecture, making them hard to implement at large scales. To overcome these challenges, we propose the gated quantized variational autoencoder (GQ-VAE), a novel architecture that can be independently pre-trained to serve as a drop-in replacement for existing tokenizers. The key innovation of the architecture is to learn to encode variable-length discrete tokens. GQ-VAE improves compression and language modeling performance over a standard VQ-VAE tokenizer, and approaches the compression rate and language modeling performance of BPE. Interestingly, if we use BPE with a smaller vocabulary, such that the compression is equivalent between GQ-VAE and BPE, we find that GQ-VAE improves downstream language model learning. We conclude with a discussion of several exciting avenues for future work. Code can be found at https://github.com/Theo-Datta-115/gq-vae.

Conclusion: DATE有效解决异构数据生成中的多样性-质量权衡问题，为小样本学习和LLM增强提供新途径。

Abstract: Tabular data generation has become increasingly essential for enabling robust machine learning applications, which require large-scale, high-quality data. Existing solutions leverage generative models to learn original data distributions. However, real-world data are naturally heterogeneous with diverse distributions, making it challenging to obtain a universally good model for diverse data generation. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Tabular data gEnerator (DATE), a framework that (i) prepares high-quality and distributionally distinct examples for in-context learning by effectively partitioning the original heterogeneous data into multiple diverse subsets; (ii) harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the diversity of the partitioned distribution with decision tree reasoning as feedback, generating high-quality labeled data for each subset. However, the massive generated data inherently involves a trade-off between diversity and quality. To integrate this issue, existing solutions greedily select the validation-best data. However, we prove that the selection in heterogeneous settings does not possess the greedy-choice property, and design a Multi-Arm Bandit-based sampling algorithm that balances the diversity and quality of generated data. Extensive experiments on tabular classification and regression benchmarks demonstrate that DATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based and LLM-based methods. On average, DATE achieves a 23.75% reduction in error rate with just 100 generated data. Empirically, we demonstrate that data generated by DATE can improve the accuracy of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and enhance the reasoning capability of LLMs on the target data. Code is available at https://github.com/windblow32/DATE.

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统链接函数假设的限制，实现了更鲁棒、直接的策略优化，适用于复杂和未知偏好结构的场景。

Abstract: Aligning large language models to preference data is commonly implemented by assuming a known link function between the distribution of observed preferences and the unobserved rewards (e.g., a logistic link as in Bradley-Terry). If the link is wrong, however, inferred rewards can be biased and policies be misaligned. We study policy alignment to preferences under an unknown and unrestricted link. We consider an $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization problem and show that realizability of the solution in a policy class implies a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar-valued index determined by a policy captures the dependence on demonstrations and the rest of the preference distribution is an unrestricted function thereof. Rather than focus on estimation of identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters in the index as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning, focusing on error to the optimal policy and allowing unidentifiable and nonparametric indices. We develop a variety of policy learners based on profiling the link function, orthogonalizing the link function, and using link-agnostic bipartite ranking objectives. We analyze these and provide finite-sample policy error bounds that depend on generic functional complexity measures of the index class. We further consider practical implementations using first-order optimization suited to neural networks and batched data. The resulting methods are robust to unknown preference noise distribution and scale, while preserving the direct optimization of policies without explicitly fitting rewards.

Conclusion: 混合框架在高质量离线数据下表现显著优越，同时能有效缓解离线数据的局限性

Abstract: The problem of combinatorial multi-armed bandits with probabilistically triggered arms (CMAB-T) has been extensively studied. Prior work primarily focuses on either the online setting where an agent learns about the unknown environment through iterative interactions, or the offline setting where a policy is learned solely from logged data. However, each of these paradigms has inherent limitations: online algorithms suffer from high interaction costs and slow adaptation, while offline methods are constrained by dataset quality and lack of exploration capabilities. To address these complementary weaknesses, we propose hybrid CMAB-T, a new framework that integrates offline data with online interaction in a principled manner. Our proposed hybrid CUCB algorithm leverages offline data to guide exploration and accelerate convergence, while strategically incorporating online interactions to mitigate the insufficient coverage or distributional bias of the offline dataset. We provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's regret, demonstrating that hybrid CUCB significantly outperforms purely online approaches when high-quality offline data is available, and effectively corrects the bias inherent in offline-only methods when the data is limited or misaligned. Empirical results further demonstrate the consistent advantage of our algorithm.

Traditional computational approaches often rely on experimentally determined 3D structures, which are scarce and computationally expensive to obtain. This paper introduces DuaDeep-SeqAffinity, a novel sequence-only deep learning framework that predicts affinity scores solely from their amino acid sequences using a dual-stream hybrid architecture. Our approach leverages pre-trained ESM-2 protein language model embeddings, combining 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local motif detection with Transformer encoders for global contextual representation. A subsequent fusion module integrates these multi-faceted features, which are then passed to a fully connected network for final score regression. Experimental results demonstrate that DuaDeep-SeqAffinity significantly outperforms individual architectural components and existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. DuaDeep achieved a superior Pearson correlation of 0.688, an R^2 of 0.460, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.737, surpassing single-branch variants ESM-CNN and ESM-Transformer. Notably, the model achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.890, outperforming sequence-only benchmarks and even surpassing structure-sequence hybrid models. These findings prove that high-fidelity sequence embeddings can capture essential binding patterns typically reserved for structural modeling. By eliminating the reliance on 3D structures, DuaDeep-SeqAffinity provides a highly scalable and efficient solution for high-throughput screening of vast sequence libraries, significantly accelerating the therapeutic discovery pipeline.

Abstract: Robustness in complex systems is of significant engineering and economic importance. However, conventional attack-based a posteriori robustness assessments incur prohibitive computational overhead. Recently, deep learning methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have been widely employed as surrogates for rapid robustness prediction. Nevertheless, these methods neglect the complex higher-order correlations prevalent in real-world systems, which are naturally modeled as hypergraphs. Although Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have been widely adopted for hypergraph learning, their topological expressive power has not yet reached the theoretical upper bound. To address this limitation, inspired by Graph Isomorphism Networks, this paper proposes a hypergraph-level Hypergraph Isomorphism Network framework. Theoretically, this approach is proven to possess an expressive power strictly equivalent to the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test and is applied to predict hypergraph robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that while maintaining superior efficiency in training and prediction, the proposed method not only outperforms existing graph-based models but also significantly surpasses conventional HGNNs in tasks that prioritize topological structure representation.

Motivation: 传统固定窗口平滑方法在稀疏阵列中因扰动秩一外积导致信号与噪声子空间分离不足

Method: 引入可变窗口大小（VWS）机制，用无扰动低秩项替换部分扰动项，构造VWS-CA-MUSIC和VWS-CA-rMUSIC算法，并推导压缩参数的可辨识性边界

Result: 在稀疏阵列仿真中，相较固定窗口方法，显著提升估计性能并降低计算复杂度

Conclusion: VWS框架有效增强子空间分离，为稀疏阵列DOA估计提供了更优解决方案

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a variable window size (VWS) spatial smoothing framework that enhances coarray-based direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sparse linear arrays. By compressing the smoothing aperture, the proposed VWS Coarray MUSIC (VWS-CA-MUSIC) and VWS Coarray root-MUSIC (VWS-CA-rMUSIC) algorithms replace part of the perturbed rank-one outer products in the smoothed coarray data with unperturbed low-rank additional terms, increasing the separation between signal and noise subspaces, while preserving the signal subspace span. We also derive the bounds that guarantees identifiability, by limiting the values that can be assumed by the compression parameter. Simulations with sparse geometries reveal significant performance improvements and complexity savings relative to the fixed-window coarray MUSIC method.

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in Continual Learning (CL) is catastrophic forgetting, where adapting to new tasks degrades the performance on previous ones. While the field has evolved with diverse methods, this rapid surge in diverse methodologies has culminated in a fragmented research landscape. The lack of a unified framework, including inconsistent implementations, conflicting dependencies, and varying evaluation protocols, makes fair comparison and reproducible research increasingly difficult. To address this challenge, we propose LibContinual, a comprehensive and reproducible library designed to serve as a foundational platform for realistic CL. Built upon a high-cohesion, low-coupling modular architecture, LibContinual integrates 19 representative algorithms across five major methodological categories, providing a standardized execution environment. Meanwhile, leveraging this unified framework, we systematically identify and investigate three implicit assumptions prevalent in mainstream evaluation: (1) offline data accessibility, (2) unregulated memory resources, and (3) intra-task semantic homogeneity. We argue that these assumptions often overestimate the real-world applicability of CL methods. Through our comprehensive analysis using strict online CL settings, a novel unified memory budget protocol, and a proposed category-randomized setting, we reveal significant performance drops in many representative CL methods when subjected to these real-world constraints. Our study underscores the necessity of resource-aware and semantically robust CL strategies, and offers LibContinual as a foundational toolkit for future research in realistic continual learning.

Abstract: Hit identification is a critical yet resource-intensive step in the drug discovery pipeline, traditionally relying on high-throughput screening of large compound libraries. Despite advancements in virtual screening, these methods remain time-consuming and costly. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled the development of generative models capable of learning complex molecular representations and generating novel compounds de novo. However, using ML to replace the entire drug-discovery pipeline is highly challenging. In this work, we rather investigate whether generative models can replace one step of the pipeline: hit-like molecule generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly frame hit-like molecule generation as a standalone task and empirically test whether generative models can directly support this stage of the drug discovery pipeline. Specifically, we investigate if such models can be trained to generate hit-like molecules, enabling direct incorporation into, or even substitution of, traditional hit identification workflows. We propose an evaluation framework tailored to this task, integrating physicochemical, structural, and bioactivity-related criteria within a multi-stage filtering pipeline that defines the hit-like chemical space. Two autoregressive and one diffusion-based generative models were benchmarked across various datasets and training settings, with outputs assessed using standard metrics and target-specific docking scores. Our results show that these models can generate valid, diverse, and biologically relevant compounds across multiple targets, with a few selected GSK-3$β$ hits synthesized and confirmed active in vitro. We also identify key limitations in current evaluation metrics and available training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代学习系统的稳定性分析常依赖光滑性假设，但ReLU激活函数违反这些假设，导致理论与实践脱节。

Method: 通过构造反例证明全局梯度Lipschitz性或Hessian控制无法成立，并提出最小化广义导数条件以恢复稳定性。

Result: 揭示了光滑近似ReLU的误导性，并指出经典稳定性界在ReLU网络中失效。

Conclusion: 应发展非光滑感知的稳定性分析框架，以更准确地理解ReLU网络的训练行为。

Abstract: Stability analyses of modern learning systems are frequently derived under smoothness assumptions that are violated by ReLU-type nonlinearities. In this note, we isolate a minimal obstruction by showing that no uniform smoothness-based stability proxy such as gradient Lipschitzness or Hessian control can hold globally for ReLU networks, even in simple settings where training trajectories appear empirically stable. We give a concrete counterexample demonstrating the failure of classical stability bounds and identify a minimal generalized derivative condition under which stability statements can be meaningfully restored. The result clarifies why smooth approximations of ReLU can be misleading and motivates nonsmooth-aware stability frameworks.

Motivation: 传统PGD对所有样本进行相同迭代优化，效率低且样本贡献不均

Method: 提出选择性对抗训练，采用基于边距和梯度匹配的准则筛选关键样本，仅对子集生成对抗样本，其余样本干净训练

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上达到与全PGD相当甚至更好的鲁棒性，计算量减少达50%

Conclusion: 智能样本选择足以实现可扩展的对抗鲁棒性，无需对所有样本进行昂贵的对抗优化

Abstract: Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is a strong and widely used first-order adversarial attack, yet its computational cost scales poorly, as all training samples undergo identical iterative inner-loop optimization despite contributing unequally to robustness. Motivated by this inefficiency, we propose \emph{Selective Adversarial Training}, which perturbs only a subset of critical samples in each minibatch. Specifically, we introduce two principled selection criteria: (1) margin-based sampling, which prioritizes samples near the decision boundary, and (2) gradient-matching sampling, which selects samples whose gradients align with the dominant batch optimization direction. Adversarial examples are generated only for the selected subset, while the remaining samples are trained cleanly using a mixed objective. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that the proposed methods achieve robustness comparable to, or even exceeding, full PGD adversarial training, while reducing adversarial computation by up to $50\%$, demonstrating that informed sample selection is sufficient for scalable adversarial robustness.

Method: 将Transformer训练过程形式化为ODE系统，近似为核行为，严格分析SGD在序列到序列数据上的收敛性，推导泛化误差与计算资源的关系。

Result: 发现泛化误差在初始优化阶段呈指数衰减，越过资源阈值后进入统计相，呈$Θ(\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$幂律衰减，并独立推导出模型大小、训练时间和数据规模各自的缩放律。

Conclusion: 本工作首次为Transformer训练提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了计算资源扩展中的相变机制，并为优化资源配置提供了理论依据。

Abstract: The scaling law, a cornerstone of Large Language Model (LLM) development, predicts improvements in model performance with increasing computational resources. Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates this process to kernel behaviors. Departing from prior toy-model analyses, we rigorously analyze stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training for multi-layer transformers on sequence-to-sequence data with arbitrary data distribution, closely mirroring real-world conditions. Our analysis characterizes the convergence of generalization error to the irreducible risk as computational resources scale with data, especially during the optimization process.
  We establish a theoretical upper bound on excess risk characterized by a distinct phase transition. In the initial optimization phase, the excess risk decays exponentially relative to the computational cost ${\sf C}$. However, once a specific resource allocation threshold is crossed, the system enters a statistical phase, where the generalization error follows a power-law decay of $Θ(\mathsf{C}^{-1/6})$. Beyond this unified framework, our theory derives isolated scaling laws for model size, training time, and dataset size, elucidating how each variable independently governs the upper bounds of generalization.

Abstract: Automating end-to-end data science pipeline with AI agents still stalls on two gaps: generating insightful, diverse visual evidence and assembling it into a coherent, professional report. We present A2P-Vis, a two-part, multi-agent pipeline that turns raw datasets into a high-quality data-visualization report. The Data Analyzer orchestrates profiling, proposes diverse visualization directions, generates and executes plotting code, filters low-quality figures with a legibility checker, and elicits candidate insights that are automatically scored for depth, correctness, specificity, depth and actionability. The Presenter then orders topics, composes chart-grounded narratives from the top-ranked insights, writes justified transitions, and revises the document for clarity and consistency, yielding a coherent, publication-ready report. Together, these agents convert raw data into curated materials (charts + vetted insights) and into a readable narrative without manual glue work. We claim that by coupling a quality-assured Analyzer with a narrative Presenter, A2P-Vis operationalizes co-analysis end-to-end, improving the real-world usefulness of automated data analysis for practitioners.

Conclusion: 该PID驱动框架为多模态回归提供了可解释、可量化的分析新范式，兼具实用性与理论严谨性

Abstract: Multimodal regression aims to predict a continuous target from heterogeneous input sources and typically relies on fusion strategies such as early or late fusion. However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference. Implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaozhaoma/PIDReg.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) spectral remote sensing technology is widely used in water quality monitoring. However, in dynamic environments, varying illumination conditions, such as shadows and specular reflection (sun glint), can cause severe spectral distortion, thereby reducing data availability. To maximize the acquisition of high-quality data while ensuring flight safety, this paper proposes an active path planning method for dynamic light and shadow disturbance avoidance. First, a dynamic prediction model is constructed to transform the time-varying light and shadow disturbance areas into three-dimensional virtual obstacles. Second, an improved Interfered Fluid Dynamical System (IFDS) algorithm is introduced, which generates a smooth initial obstacle avoidance path by building a repulsive force field. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is employed for rolling-horizon path optimization to handle flight dynamics constraints and achieve real-time trajectory tracking. Furthermore, a Dynamic Flight Altitude Adjustment (DFAA) mechanism is designed to actively reduce the flight altitude when the observable area is narrow, thereby enhancing spatial resolution. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional PID and single obstacle avoidance algorithms, the proposed method achieves an obstacle avoidance success rate of 98% in densely disturbed scenarios, significantly improves path smoothness, and increases the volume of effective observation data by approximately 27%. This research provides an effective engineering solution for precise UAV water quality monitoring in complex illumination environments.

Abstract: In cluttered environments, motion planners often face a trade-off between safety and speed due to uncertainty caused by occlusions and limited sensor range. In this work, we investigate whether co-pilot instructions can help robots plan more decisively while remaining safe. We introduce PaceForecaster, as an approach that incorporates such co-pilot instructions into local planners. PaceForecaster takes the robot's local sensor footprint (Level-1) and the provided co-pilot instructions as input and predicts (i) a forecasted map with all regions visible from Level-1 (Level-2) and (ii) an instruction-conditioned subgoal within Level-2. The subgoal provides the planner with explicit guidance to exploit the forecasted environment in a goal-directed manner. We integrate PaceForecaster with a Log-MPPI controller and demonstrate that using language-conditioned forecasts and goals improves navigation performance by 36% over a local-map-only baseline while in polygonal environments.

Conclusion: UAM交通流可类比地面交通建模，但必须依赖真实实验校准；所提框架与公开数据集为未来UAM系统设计提供坚实基础。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that promises to reduce travel time and alleviate congestion in urban transportation systems. As drone density increases, UAM operations are expected to experience congestion similar to that in ground traffic. However, the fundamental characteristics of UAM traffic flow, particularly under real-world operating conditions, remain poorly understood. This study proposes a general framework for constructing the fundamental diagram (FD) of UAM traffic by integrating theoretical analysis with physical experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to derive a UAM FD using real-world physical test data. On the theoretical side, we design two drone control laws for collision avoidance and develop simulation-based traffic generation methods to produce diverse UAM traffic scenarios. Based on Edie's definition, traffic flow theory is then applied to construct the FD and characterize the macroscopic properties of UAM traffic. To account for real-world disturbances and modeling uncertainties, we further conduct physical experiments on a reduced-scale testbed using Bitcraze Crazyflie drones. Both simulation and physical test trajectory data are collected and organized into the UAMTra2Flow dataset, which is analyzed using the proposed framework. Preliminary results indicate that classical FD structures for ground transportation are also applicable to UAM systems. Notably, FD curves obtained from physical experiments exhibit deviations from simulation-based results, highlighting the importance of experimental validation. Finally, results from the reduced-scale testbed are scaled to realistic operating conditions to provide practical insights for future UAM traffic systems. The dataset and code for this paper are publicly available at https://github.com/CATS-Lab/UAM-FD.

Abstract: Visuomotor policies based on generative architectures such as diffusion and flow-based matching have shown strong performance but degrade under distribution shifts, demonstrating limited recovery capabilities without costly finetuning. In the language modeling domain, test-time compute scaling has revolutionized reasoning capabilities of modern LLMs by leveraging additional inference-time compute for candidate solution refinement. These methods typically leverage foundation models as verification modules in a zero-shot manner to synthesize improved candidate solutions. In this work, we hypothesize that generative policies can similarly benefit from additional inference-time compute that employs zero-shot VLM-based verifiers. A systematic analysis of improving policy performance through the generation-verification framework remains relatively underexplored in the current literature. To this end, we introduce EVE - a modular, generator-verifier interaction framework - that boosts the performance of pretrained generative policies at test time, with no additional training. EVE wraps a frozen base policy with multiple zero-shot, VLM-based verifier agents. Each verifier proposes action refinements to the base policy candidate actions, while an action incorporator fuses the aggregated verifier output into the base policy action prediction to produce the final executed action. We study design choices for generator-verifier information interfacing across a system of verifiers with distinct capabilities. Across a diverse suite of manipulation tasks, EVE consistently improves task success rates without any additional policy training. Through extensive ablations, we isolate the contribution of verifier capabilities and action incorporator strategies, offering practical guidelines to build scalable, modular generator-verifier systems for embodied control.

Abstract: Planetary rover exploration is attracting renewed interest with several upcoming space missions to the Moon and Mars. However, a substantial amount of data from prior missions remain underutilized for path planning and autonomous navigation research. As a result, there is a lack of space mission-based planetary datasets, standardized benchmarks, and evaluation protocols. In this paper, we take a step towards coordinating these three research directions in the context of planetary rover path planning. We propose the first two large planar benchmark datasets, MarsPlanBench and MoonPlanBench, derived from high-resolution digital terrain images of Mars and the Moon. In addition, we set up classical and learned path planning algorithms, in a unified framework, and evaluate them on our proposed datasets and on a popular planning benchmark. Through comprehensive experiments, we report new insights on the performance of representative path planning algorithms on planetary terrains, for the first time to the best of our knowledge. Our results show that classical algorithms can achieve up to 100% global path planning success rates on average across challenging terrains such as Moon's north and south poles. This suggests, for instance, why these algorithms are used in practice by NASA. Conversely, learning-based models, although showing promising results in less complex environments, still struggle to generalize to planetary domains. To serve as a starting point for fundamental path planning research, our code and datasets will be released at: https://github.com/mchancan/PlanetaryPathBench.

Abstract: In this work, we extend the Spatiotemporal Tube (STT) framework to address Probabilistic Temporal Reach-Avoid-Stay (PrT-RAS) tasks in dynamic environments with uncertain obstacles. We develop a real-time tube synthesis procedure that explicitly accounts for time-varying uncertain obstacles and provides formal probabilistic safety guarantees. The STT is formulated as a time-varying ball in the state space whose center and radius evolve online based on uncertain sensory information. We derive a closed-form, approximation-free control law that confines the system trajectory within the tube, ensuring both probabilistic safety and task satisfaction. Our method offers a formal guarantee for probabilistic avoidance and finite-time task completion. The resulting controller is model-free, approximation-free, and optimization-free, enabling efficient real-time execution while guaranteeing convergence to the target. The effectiveness and scalability of the framework are demonstrated through simulation studies and hardware experiments on mobile robots, a UAV, and a 7-DOF manipulator navigating in cluttered and uncertain environments.

Conclusion: HWS-ELJ是一种高效、紧凑、电压可控的变刚度机制，具备在机器人手指中实用化的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel variable stiffness mechanism termed Helically Wound Structured Electrostatic Layer Jamming (HWS-ELJ) and systematically investigates its potential applications in variable stiffness robotic finger design. The proposed method utilizes electrostatic attraction to enhance interlayer friction, thereby suppressing relative sliding and enabling tunable stiffness. Compared with conventional planar ELJ, the helical configuration of HWS-ELJ provides exponentially increasing stiffness adjustment with winding angle, achieving significantly greater stiffness enhancement for the same electrode contact area while reducing the required footprint under equivalent stiffness conditions. Considering the practical advantage of voltage-based control, a series of experimental tests under different initial force conditions were conducted to evaluate the stiffness modulation characteristics of HWS-ELJ. The results demonstrated its rational design and efficacy, with outcomes following the deduced theoretical trends. Furthermore, a robotic finger prototype integrating HWS-ELJ was developed, demonstrating voltage-driven stiffness modulation and confirming the feasibility of the proposed robotic variable stiffness mechanism.

Conclusion: 结构化人体表示结合轻量物理约束，可从单目输入生成机器人可用的运动。

Abstract: Recovering world-coordinate human motion from monocular videos with humanoid robot retargeting is significant for embodied intelligence and robotics. To avoid complex SLAM pipelines or heavy temporal models, we propose a lightweight, engineering-oriented framework that leverages SAM 3D Body (3DB) as a frozen perception backbone and uses the Momentum HumanRig (MHR) representation as a robot-friendly intermediate. Our method (i) locks the identity and skeleton-scale parameters of per tracked subject to enforce temporally consistent bone lengths, (ii) smooths per-frame predictions via efficient sliding-window optimization in the low-dimensional MHR latent space, and (iii) recovers physically plausible global root trajectories with a differentiable soft foot-ground contact model and contact-aware global optimization. Finally, we retarget the reconstructed motion to the Unitree G1 humanoid using a kinematics-aware two-stage inverse kinematics pipeline. Results on real monocular videos show that our method has stable world trajectories and reliable robot retargeting, indicating that structured human representations with lightweight physical constraints can yield robot-ready motion from monocular input.

Conclusion: 压缩图像中心记忆是终身具身代理实现长时视觉推理与类人导航效率的实用可扩展接口。

Abstract: Lifelong embodied navigation requires agents to accumulate, retain, and exploit spatial-semantic experience across tasks, enabling efficient exploration in novel environments and rapid goal reaching in familiar ones. While object-centric memory is interpretable, it depends on detection and reconstruction pipelines that limit robustness and scalability. We propose an image-centric memory framework that achieves long-term implicit memory via an efficient visual context compression module end-to-end coupled with a Qwen2.5-VL-based navigation policy. Built atop a ViT backbone with frozen DINOv3 features and lightweight PixelUnshuffle+Conv blocks, our visual tokenizer supports configurable compression rates; for example, under a representative 16$\times$ compression setting, each image is encoded with about 30 tokens, expanding the effective context capacity from tens to hundreds of images. Experimental results on GOAT-Bench and HM3D-OVON show that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance, improving exploration in unfamiliar environments and shortening paths in familiar ones. Ablation studies further reveal that moderate compression provides the best balance between efficiency and accuracy. These findings position compressed image-centric memory as a practical and scalable interface for lifelong embodied agents, enabling them to reason over long visual histories and navigate with human-like efficiency.

Abstract: Multi-robot path planning is a fundamental yet challenging problem due to its combinatorial complexity and the need to balance global efficiency with fair task allocation among robots. Traditional swarm intelligence methods, although effective on small instances, often converge prematurely and struggle to scale to complex environments. In this work, we present a structure-induced exploration framework that integrates structural priors into the search process of the ant colony optimization (ACO). The approach leverages the spatial distribution of the task to induce a structural prior at initialization, thereby constraining the search space. The pheromone update rule is then designed to emphasize structurally meaningful connections and incorporates a load-aware objective to reconcile the total travel distance with individual robot workload. An explicit overlap suppression strategy further ensures that tasks remain distinct and balanced across the team. The proposed framework was validated on diverse benchmark scenarios covering a wide range of instance sizes and robot team configurations. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in route compactness, stability, and workload distribution compared to representative metaheuristic baselines. Beyond performance gains, the method also provides a scalable and interpretable framework that can be readily applied to logistics, surveillance, and search-and-rescue applications where reliable large-scale coordination is essential.

Motivation: 现有方法假设单一生效动作，无法应对真实社交环境中的动作不确定性与多义性。

Method: 引入MAction-SocialNav模型，结合新颖的元认知提示（MCP）方法，并构建包含789个样本、双人标注的多动作社交导航数据集，设计五项评估指标。

Result: 在决策质量（APG: 0.595）和安全性（ER: 0.264）上显著优于GPT-4o和Claude，推理速度达1.524 FPS，超3倍更快。

Conclusion: MAction-SocialNav有效解决社交导航中的动作模糊性问题，兼具高精度、高安全性和实时性，具备实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires robots to move safely and appropriately in human-centered environments by respecting social norms. However, social norms are often ambiguous, and in a single scenario, multiple actions may be equally acceptable. Most existing methods simplify this problem by assuming a single correct action, which limits their ability to handle real-world social uncertainty. In this work, we propose MAction-SocialNav, an efficient vision language model for socially compliant navigation that explicitly addresses action ambiguity, enabling generating multiple plausible actions within one scenario. To enhance the model's reasoning capability, we introduce a novel meta-cognitive prompt (MCP) method. Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed method, we curate a multi-action socially compliant navigation dataset that accounts for diverse conditions, including crowd density, indoor and outdoor environments, and dual human annotations. The dataset contains 789 samples, each with three-turn conversation, split into 710 training samples and 79 test samples through random selection. We also design five evaluation metrics to assess high-level decision precision, safety, and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAction-SocialNav achieves strong social reasoning performance while maintaining high efficiency, highlighting its potential for real-world human robot navigation. Compared with zero-shot GPT-4o and Claude, our model achieves substantially higher decision quality (APG: 0.595 vs. 0.000/0.025) and safety alignment (ER: 0.264 vs. 0.642/0.668), while maintaining real-time efficiency (1.524 FPS, over 3x faster).

Abstract: Embodied agents tasked with complex scenarios, whether in real or simulated environments, rely heavily on robust planning capabilities. When instructions are formulated in natural language, large language models (LLMs) equipped with extensive linguistic knowledge can play this role. However, to effectively exploit the ability of such models to handle linguistic ambiguity, to retrieve information from the environment, and to be based on the available skills of an agent, an appropriate architecture must be designed. We propose a Hierarchical Embodied Language Planner, called HELP, consisting of a set of LLM-based agents, each dedicated to solving a different subtask. We evaluate the proposed approach on a household task and perform real-world experiments with an embodied agent. We also focus on the use of open source LLMs with a relatively small number of parameters, to enable autonomous deployment.

Result: 在长距离视觉预测和大环境导航成功率上显著优于现有世界模型。

Conclusion: ANWM通过语义与几何联合建模，有效提升无人机在复杂三维环境中的自主导航性能。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as powerful embodied agents. One of the core abilities is autonomous navigation in large-scale three-dimensional environments. Existing navigation policies, however, are typically optimized for low-level objectives such as obstacle avoidance and trajectory smoothness, lacking the ability to incorporate high-level semantics into planning. To bridge this gap, we propose ANWM, an aerial navigation world model that predicts future visual observations conditioned on past frames and actions, thereby enabling agents to rank candidate trajectories by their semantic plausibility and navigational utility. ANWM is trained on 4-DoF UAV trajectories and introduces a physics-inspired module: Future Frame Projection (FFP), which projects past frames into future viewpoints to provide coarse geometric priors. This module mitigates representational uncertainty in long-distance visual generation and captures the mapping between 3D trajectories and egocentric observations. Empirical results demonstrate that ANWM significantly outperforms existing world models in long-distance visual forecasting and improves UAV navigation success rates in large-scale environments.

Abstract: Multitask learning poses significant challenges due to the highly multimodal and diverse nature of robot action distributions. However, effectively fitting policies to these complex task distributions is often difficult, and existing monolithic models often underfit the action distribution and lack the flexibility required for efficient adaptation. We introduce a novel modular diffusion policy framework that factorizes complex action distributions into a composition of specialized diffusion models, each capturing a distinct sub-mode of the behavior space for a more effective overall policy. In addition, this modular structure enables flexible policy adaptation to new tasks by adding or fine-tuning components, which inherently mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation settings, we illustrate how our method consistently outperforms strong modular and monolithic baselines.

Abstract: Stereo cameras closely mimic human binocular vision, providing rich spatial cues critical for precise robotic manipulation. Despite their advantage, the adoption of stereo vision in vision-language-action models (VLAs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present StereoVLA, a VLA model that leverages rich geometric cues from stereo vision. We propose a novel Geometric-Semantic Feature Extraction module that utilizes vision foundation models to extract and fuse two key features: 1) geometric features from subtle stereo-view differences for spatial perception; 2) semantic-rich features from the monocular view for instruction following. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary Interaction-Region Depth Estimation task to further enhance spatial perception and accelerate model convergence. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines by a large margin in diverse tasks under the stereo setting and demonstrates strong robustness to camera pose variations.

Abstract: Endotracheal intubation is a critical yet technically demanding procedure, with failure or improper tube placement leading to severe complications. Existing robotic and teleoperated intubation systems primarily focus on airway navigation and do not provide integrated control of endotracheal tube advancement or objective verification of tube depth relative to the carina. This paper presents the Robotic Intubation System (BRIS), a compact, human-in-the-loop platform designed to assist fiberoptic-guided intubation while enabling real-time, objective depth awareness. BRIS integrates a four-way steerable fiberoptic bronchoscope, an independent endotracheal tube advancement mechanism, and a camera-augmented mouthpiece compatible with standard clinical workflows. A learning-enabled closed-loop control framework leverages real-time shape sensing to map joystick inputs to distal bronchoscope tip motion in Cartesian space, providing stable and intuitive teleoperation under tendon nonlinearities and airway contact. Monocular endoscopic depth estimation is used to classify airway regions and provide interpretable, anatomy-aware guidance for safe tube positioning relative to the carina. The system is validated on high-fidelity airway mannequins under standard and difficult airway configurations, demonstrating reliable navigation and controlled tube placement. These results highlight BRIS as a step toward safer, more consistent, and clinically compatible robotic airway management.
